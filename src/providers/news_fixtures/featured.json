And once again, it seems like it will be a big year for smart glasses and AI.</p>\n<p>This year, the event will take a slightly different format than in the past. Mark Zuckerberg is <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/connect/agenda/\"><ins>scheduled</ins></a> to kick things off with an evening keynote at 5PM PT on Wednesday, September 17.

The frames, often referred to by their reported internal name &quot;<a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/report-meta-could-release-its-first-true-ar-headset-as-soon-as-2027-222502610.html\"><ins>Hypernova</ins></a>,&quot; will be the first consumer-ready glasses from Meta that have a display. We already know quite a bit about these thanks to more than a year of leaks.</p>\n<p>While the frames are expected to have a small display on one side, they won't offer the kind of immersive augmented reality experience we've seen on Meta's <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-orion-prototype-offers-a-glimpse-into-our-ar-future-123038066.html\"><ins>Orion prototype</ins></a>.

Up to now, the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley glasses have mostly been limited to apps within Meta's ecosystem (with a few exceptions like Spotify and Audible). Allowing more developers to start experimenting with the platform could bring even more functionality to the existing lineup of glasses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-meta-ai\">Meta AI</h2>\n<p>As with other recent years, AI will be a major theme throughout. Meta AI has <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-already-has-1-billion-active-users-120023875.html\"><ins>a billion</ins></a> monthly users (something Zuckerberg will surely remind us of) and I'm expecting to see new features for Meta AI both on the company's glasses and within its apps. <em>Business Insider</em> <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-hires-contractors-build-ai-chatbot-characters-key-markets-2025-9\"><ins>reports</ins></a> the company has been working on new lineup of non-English speaking &quot;character-driven&quot; bots for its apps. (Meta's character-centric chatbots have also faced scrutiny, with the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-re-training-its-ai-so-it-wont-discuss-self-harm-or-have-romantic-conversations-with-teens-182418587.html\">recently blocking</a> teens' access to many user-generated characters amid growing safety concerns.)</p>\n<p>Outside of Meta's chatbots, I'm hoping Zuckerberg will talk more about his vision to create &quot;superintelligence.&quot; As I wrote in July, his <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html\"><ins>initial manifesto</ins></a> that outlined his vision was confusing at best.

In a recent Instagram post, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth teased &quot;metaverse software&quot; updates related to Horizon Worlds at Connect.

      "content": "Nick Tsergas , freelance journalist Hamilton, Ontario nick{at}canadahealthwatch.ca\n\n“Immunity debt,” a theory to explain the global surge in non-covid infections since pandemic restrictions were lifted, is increasingly being challenged by emerging evidence. Nick Tsergas reports\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae is a bacterial infection not known to cause widespread hospital admissions. “I can count on my two hands the number of times I’d ever seen mycoplasma pneumoniae before 2023,” says Samira Jeimy, clinical immunologist at the University of Western Ontario. “All of a sudden I feel like everybody has it.”1\n\nOver the past three years similar reports have circulated of rising bacterial infections, flare-ups of old viruses becoming more common, and children landing in hospital with diseases not usually seen in young, healthy people. One explanation offered by public health leaders has been “immunity debt”2—the idea that precautions taken in the covid pandemic suppressed routine exposures to circulating pathogens, leaving people more vulnerable to them when restrictions were lifted.\n\nThe theory landed in the public consciousness at the right moment. A simple idea that sounded like science, it soothed a public seeking answers just as the world was returning to a semblance of normality. And it served a policy function, allowing governments to focus on economic recovery.\n\nBut its explanatory power has faded as the number of non-covid infections has kept rising each year. A 2024 analysis by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention3 found that invasive group A strep infections saw their most dramatic year-on-year increase from 2021 to 2022, well after most precautions had been lifted in the US. Rates have been abnormally high since then, raising questions about what might be behind the trend.\n\nA growing number of scientists believe that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may instead be subtly altering our immune systems. If correct, their hypothesis will change how we understand everything from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to shingles to sepsis.\n\nImmunity debt—or disruption? Malgorzata Gasperowicz, a Calgary based developmental biologist, says that if immunity debt fully explained rising infection counts we’d expect to see a uniform rebound across all pathogens. But we don’t, she says. For instance, a 2024 study of more than 4000 viral cases from Ontario, Canada,4 found higher rates of bacterial infections in people recovering from covid-19 than in those recovering from influenza or RSV—although study groups weren’t perfectly matched by age or clinical setting, limiting direct comparisons. Jeimy says that many infants and toddlers admitted to hospital with rare infections since 20225 weren’t yet born when pandemic restrictions were in place, and they therefore couldn’t be experiencing immunity debt. They were, however, likely exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Wolfgang Leitner, chief of the Innate Immunity Section at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), speculates that covid-19 may somehow impair the immune system’s “memory” of past infections, potentially making even healthy people more vulnerable to future pathogens. He wonders whether the virus leaves lasting scars on the immune system’s T cell defences. “But that’s just (my) hypothesis,” he emphasises in an email.\n\nImmunity reset? SARS-CoV-2 is linked to “an unusually high level of ‘indiscriminate’ killing of T cells,”6 says Leitner, adding that this observation is “reminiscent of” measles, which can cause immune amnesia by depleting memory B cells (a different type of immune cell), leaving people vulnerable to pathogens they were previously immune to.7 This concept of immune “reset” after infections isn’t new. A hallmark of this phenomenon is the reactivation of dormant viruses, which re-emerge while the immune system is in a weakened state. Reactivation of viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), has been commonly observed after covid-19. A 2023 study reported EBV reactivation in covid positive patients at more than double the rate seen in covid negative patients.8 As for VZV, a 2022 analysis of US insurance records found that people over 50 were 15% more likely to develop herpes zoster after a covid-19 diagnosis.9 Jeimy says, “There’s a pathophysiology that already exists for other viruses like EBV or measles. The plausibility is there. The precedent is there.” Brazilian researchers found that covid-19 triggered a sharp rise in T cell exhaustion and cellular ageing.10 Although the comparator group was limited, the strongest effects were seen in CD8+ T cells, which suppress latent viruses such as EBV and VZV. These effects were seen even after mild infections. Some researchers believe that these lingering immune effects, which are often subtle, may represent the sorts of immune system “scars” that Leitner describes.\n\nCan we see clinical signs? Dawn Bowdish, Canada research chair in ageing and immunity at McMaster University in Ontario, says that clinical signs are visible. “For people who test positive for covid-19, there’s an uptick in antibiotic prescriptions,” she says. “Covid-19 does have this association, for sure.” Akiko Iwasaki, director of the Yale Center for Infection and Immunity in Connecticut, USA, says that the clinical picture aligns with what she sees at the cellular level. Iwasaki says that even in patients not admitted to hospital, her lab sees clinically significant reductions in circulating T cells. A 2025 study published in the Lancet11 tracked more than 830 000 US veterans and found that even non-admitted patients who tested positive for covid-19 had higher rates of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in the year that followed. It also found that patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 were more likely to develop sepsis than those admitted with influenza. A Cell study12 of people with “long” covid suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can reprogram bone marrow stem cells, imprinting epigenetic changes that persist for at least a year, skewing some immune cells towards a state of hypersensitivity and inflammation. The findings signal a possible novel mechanism for longer term immune changes not strictly limited to populations with long covid. Finally, a 2024 study13 of long covid by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found viral RNA in gut tissue two years after infection. Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the team found that T cell activity was clustered in places where SARS-CoV-2 RNA—a likely marker of viral persistence—was also present. “There has definitely been a change in the character of the immune response since 2019,” says Tim Henrich, immunologist and senior author of the study. “It’s certainly impacting our immune health, and probably our overall health as well.”\n\nElephant in the room Long covid remains a hot topic among the public and researchers and has certainly raised awareness of postviral disease. Yet there persists an awkwardness, even a hostility, when it comes to the idea of SARS-CoV-2 undermining immune health. Ashish Jha, former White House covid-19 response coordinator under President Biden, has publicly rejected this hypothesis. “There’s a lot of bad information out there about how covid-19 damages the immune system. It really doesn’t,” he posted on X in early 2024.14 More than a year later, his view is unchanged. Jha, an internal medicine physician by training, tells The BMJ, “Of course, some very small proportion of people who get covid will get immune dysfunction and long covid. Thankfully, that is increasingly rare among new infections.” He maintains that “a lot of people who don’t have much expertise” have overstated covid’s potential to cause immune disruption in the wider population. “I have seen zero evidence to support that—and in fact, all the evidence we have suggests that is not true,” he says. “Except for the small proportion of people who might get some immune dysfunction—which happens with other viruses too—covid doesn’t damage the immune system.” Others argue that it needn’t be as black and white as “covid does or does not damage the immune system.” Nor does it necessarily have the same effect in everyone. Jeimy thinks that people who are unwilling to consider the possibility of immune damage are perhaps driven by a fear of what those answers might mean. “Nobody wants to be the one that says, ‘Yes, covid-19 causes disability’ [beyond long covid],” she says, alluding to the health and economic implications of such a conclusion. Gasperowicz says that “the burden of proof has flipped: instead of showing that something is safe, we’re asked to prove harm.” Henrich doesn’t see the hypothesis as controversial. “We’ve shown immune dysfunction post covid, including signs of exhaustion and inflammation in people without symptoms,”15 he says, adding that, at the population level, “we are probably living with more inflammation on a day-to-day basis than we were before.” The difficulty is that these changes aren’t uniform. In some patients the impact of covid-19 is dramatic; in others it’s invisible. Iwasaki and her team have found persistent immune system changes in people who have recovered from covid-19, even without any symptoms. “There are some subtle differences between healthy controls and convalescent controls,” she says, referring to people who have recovered from covid. “More subtle things might be happening in that population. And now the entire world is pretty much the convalescent control.”\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: I have read and understood the BMJ Group policy on declaration of interests and have no relevant interests to declare.\n\nProvenance: Commissioned; externally peer reviewed.",

      "title": "How an over-the-air update made Quilt’s heat pumps more powerful",
      "description": "Quilt's software update unlocked an additional 20% heating and cooling capacity for all of its heat pumps, including those installed in customers' homes.",
      "content": "Software might be eating the world, but it’s taking some industries longer than others to realize its full potential.\n\nFrom iPhones to Teslas, people have grown accustomed to software updates improving the stuff they already own. But outside consumer electronics and automobiles, over-the-air updates aren’t commonplace yet.\n\nYet that’s beginning to change, starting with an unlikely product: heat pumps. Last week, heat pump startup Quilt said that it pushed an update last week to heat pumps already installed in customers’ homes. It wasn’t just a bug fix either: The new software and firmware boosted the units’ heating and cooling capacities overnight by more than 20%.\n\n“From the very beginning, we wanted to design the systems to be able to be continuously improved, updated over the air. It’s a pattern that’s happened in EVs and gotten a lot of traction, but no one had really done that before in HVAC,” Quilt CEO Paul Lambert told TechCrunch.\n\n“In cars, sometimes they call it software-defined vehicles. We feel like we’ve created software-defined HVAC,” he added.\n\nIt can be hard to prove a negative, but according to heat pump expert Drew Tozer, the update is likely the first of its kind. Typically, when a heat pump is installed — or any piece of HVAC equipment — the only time it’s touched is when there’s a problem.\n\nBut many on Quilt’s team didn’t come from a traditional HVAC background. Instead, they were drawn from Nest, Google, Apple, and Tesla, companies where frequent updates are the norm. Isaac McQuillen, the engineer who led the capacity increase project, worked most recently at Lucid Motors, where he managed heating and cooling for both passengers and batteries.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\n“We got some feedback from both [installation] partners and some customers that it’d be really useful if we were able to have a slightly higher maximum operating capacity,” McQuillen said. Some people had larger living rooms or open floorpans that were more demanding. So the team dug in to see if the heat pumps had a little extra to give.\n\nQuilt had specified more and higher quality sensors than what is normally found in residential HVAC systems, including additional pressures sensors, higher accuracy temperature and current sensors, McQuillen said. That data was key to the project.\n\nOnce the team realized they had room to spare, they set about testing the new parameters on in-house units to validate both performance and reliability. Quilt’s updates included both software and firmware that runs on the main processor and microcontrollers scattered throughout the indoor and outdoor units.\n\nOriginally installed, the outdoor portion of a Quilt heat pump provided up to 19,700 BTUs of cooling per hour and 20,500 BTUs of heating per hour. Now cooling and heating figures have increased to 24,000 BTUs per hour and 25,200 BTUs per hour, respectively.\n\nThe new ratings don’t change how efficiently the heat pumps run, but it does allow them to better cope with extreme heat and cold.\n\nThe power of over-the-air updating doesn’t come for free. It was only possible because Quilt had used higher quality sensors, monitored the data more closely, and included networking equipment to receive the update. They added a small amount to the total bill of materials, Lambert said. But as the company sees it, the benefits far outweigh the costs. “There’s the upfront capital cost of the sensors, but we think there’s just so much value to be gained from that extra data that that we felt that was worth it to integrate them,” McQuillen said.\n\n”The hard part,” Lambert added, ”is knowing how to build all the integration around it with the software and all the systems working together.”\n\nPlus, Quilt can now sell the units to a broader range of customers without having to design and market an entirely new model. Sounds like a win-win.",

      "title": "Chinese EV players take fight to legacy European automakers on their home turf",
      "description": "Chinese electric carmakers Xpeng and GAC this week signalled aggressive expansion plans in Europe.",
      "content": "Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng speaks to reporters at the electric carmaker's stand at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nGermany this week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf. The IAA Mobility conference in Munich was packed full of companies with huge stands showing off their latest cars and technology. Among some of the biggest displays were those from Chinese electric car companies, underscoring their ambitions to expand beyond China. Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. At the same time, Tesla , which was for so long seen as the electric vehicle market leader, has seen sales decline in the region. Despite Chinese EV makers facing tariffs from the European Union, players from the world's second-largest economy have responded to the ramping up of competition by setting aggressive sales and expansion targets. \"The current growth of Xpeng globally is faster than we have expected,\" He Xiaopeng, the CEO of Xpeng told CNBC in an interview this week.\n\nAggressive expansion plans\n\nChinese carmakers who spoke to CNBC at the IAA show signaled their ambitious expansion plans. Xpeng's He said in an interview that the company is looking to launch its mass-market Mona series in Europe next year. In China, Xpeng's Mona cars start at the equivalent of just under $17,000. Bringing this to Europe would add some serious price competition.\n\nwatch now\n\nMeanwhile, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) is targeting rapid growth of its sales in Europe. Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC that the company aims to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year and at least 50,000 units by 2027. GAC also announced plans to bring two EVs — the Aion V and Aion UT — to Europe. Leapmotor was also in attendance with their own stand. There are signs that Chinese players have made early in roads into Europe. The market share of Chinese car brands in Europe nearly doubled in the first half of the year versus the same period in 2024, though it still remains low at just over 5%, according to Jato Dynamics. \"The significant presence of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers at the IAA Mobility, signals their growing ambitions and confidence in the European market,\" Murtuza Ali, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nTech and gadgets in focus\n\nMany of the Chinese car firms have positioned themselves as technology companies, much like Tesla, and their cars highlight that. Many of the electric vehicles have big screens equipped with flashy interfaces and voice assistants. And in a bid to lure buyers, some companies have included additional gadgets. For example, GAC's Aion V sported a refrigerator as well as a massage function as part of the seating.\n\nThe Aion V is one of the cars GAC is launching in Europe as it looks to expand its presence in the region. The Aion V is on display at the company's stand at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich, Germany on September 9, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nThis is one way that the Chinese players sought to differentiate themselves from legacy brands. \"The chances of success for Chinese automakers are strong, especially as they have an edge in terms of affordability, battery technology, and production scale,\" Counterpoint's Ali said.\n\nEurope's carmakers push back\n\nLegacy carmakers sought to flex their own muscles at the IAA with Volskwagen , BMW and Mercedes having among the biggest stands at the show. Mercedes in particular had advertising displayed all across the front entrance of the event. BMW, like the Chinese players, had a big focus on technology by talking up its so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system. BMW, which introduced the iX3 at the event, and chipmaker Qualcomm also announced assisted driving software that the two companies co-developed. Volkswagen and French auto firm Renault also showed off some new electric cars. Regardless of the product blitz, there are still concerns that European companies are not moving fast enough. BMW's new iX3 is based on the electric vehicle platform it first debuted two years ago. Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers have been quick in bringing out and launching newer models. \"A commitment to legacy structures and incrementalism has slowed its ability to build and leverage a robust EV ecosystem, leaving it behind fast moving rivals,\" Tammy Madsen, professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said of BMW. While European autos have a strong brand history and their CEOs acknowledged and welcomed the competition this week in interviews with CNBC, the Chinese are not letting up.\n\nwatch now",

      "content": "Thousands of Brazilians have taken to the streets to rejoice at Jair Bolsonaro’s conviction for plotting a coup, as progressive politicians celebrated the historic move and rightwing figures linked to Donald Trump responded with anger and threats.\n\nChile’s leftwing president, Gabriel Boric, led regional congratulations of the decision to jail Bolsonaro for 27 years for leading a criminal organisation that sought to seize power after the far-right populist lost the 2022 election.\n\n“My respect to Brazilian democracy which fended off a coup attempt and today judges and convicts those responsible for it. They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”\n\nColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted. Those are the rules of democracy.”\n\nIn Latin America, 11 September is a date deeply associated with authoritarianism and violence: it was on this day in 1973 that Gen Augusto Pinochet launched a US-backed coup in Chile that ushered in 17 years of brutal military rule during which thousands were killed or forcibly disappeared.\n\nBut on Thursday jubilant crowds in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, celebrated how Bolsonaro’s conviction had given new meaning to the notorious date.\n\n“I’m really overflowing with joy. This is such a symbolic day for us,” said Renan Vidal, a bank worker who was also celebrating his 37th birthday as Bolsonaro and seven co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy.\n\n“It’s the best birthday present ever,” said Vidal, who wore a rainbow flag over his shoulders. “I’m part of the LGBT community and our community was one of the worst affected by the Bolsonaro government. So for us it’s a moment to commemorate,” he added as fireworks exploded above the throng.\n\nYucca Nani, 34, said her generation associated 11 September with another terrible event: the 9/11 attacks in the US. “It was the day that changed the history of the modern world,” she said, adding: “Now in Brazil [the date] has a new meaning, which is Bolsonaro’s conviction.”\n\nAlso at the street party was Beatriz Matos, an anthropologist whose husband, the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, was murdered in the Amazon with British journalist Dom Phillips during Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. Many believe Bolsonaro’s violent, pro-gun rhetoric and dismantling of environmental and Indigenous protections helped create the backdrop for the crime.\n\n“I feel relief, happiness and fire in my eyes,” Matos said of Bolsonaro’s demise. “We must celebrate. Justice is being done!”\n\nBeto Marubo, an Indigenous leader who is godfather to Pereira’s son, said: “This is a special day for us Indigenous people and for minorities … We were the ones who most suffered under Bolsonaro and this is a breath of justice.”\n\nThose festivities contrasted with the ire of Bolsonaro backers, in and outside of Brazil.\n\nThe US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, accused Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge who oversaw Bolsonaro’s trial, of “laying waste to the rule of law” and “driving relations between our two great nations to their darkest point in two centuries”.\n\nBolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has spent months lobbying Trump officials over his father’s fate, told Reuters he expected “a firm response with actions from the US government” after Thursday’s ruling.\n\nDescribing Bolsonaro as the victim of a “political execution”, Trump has hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and announced sanctions and visa revocations against supreme court judges and other officials.\n\nAsked on Thursday if he was planning further sanctions, Trump replied: “I thought he was a good president of Brazil and it’s very surprising that [this conviction] could happen.”\n\n“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” he added.\n\nTrump’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, said: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch-hunt.​”\n\nAt the carnival-style party in Brasília, revellers shrugged off those US warnings – as did Brazil’s foreign ministry which said “threats like the one made today by [Rubio] … will not intimidate our democracy”.\n\n“Let them do it,” Vidal said of possible further US pressure. “I think Brazil’s institutions are very solid and we will not cave in to Trump’s sanctions, however powerful his country may be.”\n\nA carnival parade called the Victory of Democracy Procession is planned in Rio on Friday night.",

      "description": "Decentralized X alternative Mastodon adds support for quote posts, but with additional controls.",
      "content": "Mastodon, an open source, decentralized alternative to X, is rolling out a somewhat controversial feature by adding quote posts, which will launch next week. The feature, which allows a user to quote someone else’s post and reshare it with their own response or commentary, has contributed to a culture of “dunking” on X, where users often deride other people by responding with snark or insulting humor.\n\nTo address this concern, Mastodon says it’s implementing quote posts with safety controls.\n\nThese protections are designed to allow quote posts to be used responsibly, to “expand discussions, make new connections, and amplify underrepresented voices,” the platform states.\n\nImage Credits:Mastodon\n\nMastodon gives users several ways to control how their posts can be quoted. For starters, the platform lets users decide who can quote them through a setting where you can change your defaults. Here, you can set the permissions for who can quote you by choosing between “Anyone,” “Followers only,” or “Just me.” Additionally, you can control the visibility of quote posts by setting them to be visible to the public, to followers only, or a setting called “quiet public,” which makes the quotes public but removes them from Mastodon’s search, trends, and public timeline.\n\nUsers will also be able to override their default settings on a post-by-post basis, if need be, by navigating to the “Visibility and interaction settings” within the composer screen. This would be useful if you know you’re about to say something controversial or anything that could attract unwanted attention from those with opposing views, for instance.\n\nImage Credits:Mastodon\n\nPlus, users will have control of their posts even after they’re quoted, the Mastodon blog post about the new feature explains.\n\nWhen someone quotes a post, the user being quoted is notified in the app, and they can choose to remove their original post from the other person’s quote post. This is accessible through the Options menu (the three dots icon). From this location, users can change the quote settings to address any future quoting of their post going forward. They can also block users to prevent them from seeing and quoting their posts in the future.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Nic Coury | AFP | Getty Images\n\nFor decades, shows like \"Star Trek\" and novels like \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" have showcased fictional universal translators, capable of seamlessly converting any language into English and vice versa. Now, those gadgets once limited to works of science fiction are inching close to reality. During its iPhone unveiling event on Tuesday, Apple included a video of many travelers' dream scenario. It showed an English-speaking tourist buying flowers in an unnamed Spanish-speaking country. The florist addressed the tourist in Spanish, but what the tourist heard was in clear, coherent English. \"Today all the red carnations are 50% off,\" the tourist heard in English in her headphones, at essentially the same time that the clerk was speaking. The video was marketing material for Apple's latest AirPods Pro 3, but the feature is one of many of its kind coming from tech companies that also include Google parent Alphabet and Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.\n\nApple introduces live translation to airpods. Courtesy: Apple\n\nTechnological advancements spurred by the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 have ushered in an era of generative artificial intelligence. Almost three years later, those advancements are resulting in real-time language translators. For Apple, Live Translation is a key selling point for the AirPods Pro 3, which the company unveiled on Tuesday. The new $250 earbuds go on sale next week, and with Live Translation, users will be able to immediately hear French, German, Portuguese and Spanish translated to English. Live Translation will also arrive as an update to AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 on Monday. And when two people are speaking to each other wearing AirPods, the conversation can be translated both ways simultaneously inside each user's headphones. In Apple's video demo, it looked like two people talking to each other in different languages. Analysts are excited that the feature could mark a step forward for Apple's AI strategy. The translation feature needs to be paired with a new-enough iPhone to run Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI software suite. \"If we can actually use the AirPods for live translations, that's a feature that would actually get people to upgrade,\" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told CNBC on Wednesday. Translation is emerging as a key battleground in the technology industry as AI gets good enough to translate languages as quickly as people speak. But Apple is not alone.\n\nHost Jimmy Fallon holds Pixel 10 Pro Fold mobile phone during the 'Made by Google' event, organised to introduce the latest additions to Google's Pixel portfolio of devices, in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., August 20, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nA crowded market\n\nIn the past year, Google and Meta have also released hardware products featuring real-time translation capabilities. Google's Pixel 10 phone has a capability that can translate what a speaker is saying to the listener's language during phone calls. That feature, called Voice Translate is designed to also preserve the speaker's voice inflections. Voice Translate will start showing up on people's phones through a software update on Monday. In Google's live demo in August, Voice Translate was able to translate a sentence from entertainer Jimmy Fallon into Spanish, and it actually sounded like the comedian. Apple's feature does not try to imitate the user's voice. Meanwhile, Meta in May announced that its Ray-Ban Meta glasses would be able to translate what a person is saying in another language using the device's speakers, and the other party in the conversations would be able to see translated responses transcribed on the user's phone. Meta will hold its own product keynote on Wednesday, where the company is expected to announce the next generation of its smart glasses, which will feature a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC reported in August. It's unclear if Meta will announce more translation features.\n\nMeta employee Sara Nicholson poses with the Ray-Ban sunglasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 24, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo | Reuters\n\nAnd OpenAI in June showcased an intelligent voice assistant mode for ChatGPT that has fluid translation built in as one of many features. ChatGPT is integrated with Apple's Siri, but not in voice mode. OpenAI is planning to release new hardware products with Apple's former design guru Jony Ive in the coming years. The rise of live translation could also reshape entire industries. Translators and interpreters are the No. 1 type of job threatened by AI, and 98% of translators' work activities overlap with what AI can do, a Microsoft Research study published in August found.\n\nPurpose-built translators\n\nIn the past several years, a number of purpose-built translation gadgets have entered the market, taking advantage of global high-speed cellular service and improving online translation services to produce puck-like devices or headphones with translation built-in for a couple hundred dollars. \"What I love about what Apple is doing is it really just illuminates the fact that how pressing of an issue this is,\" said Joe Miller, U.S. general manager of Japan-based Pocketalk, which makes a $249 translation device that goes between two people conversing in different languages and translates their conversation in audio and text. Given that Apple shipped about 18 million sets of wireless headphones in the first quarter alone, according to Canalys, the company's entry into the market will expose a wider subset of customers to improvements translation tech has made in recent years. Despite Apple's entry into the market, makers of purpose-built devices say their focus on accuracy and knowledge of linguistics will provide better translations than what's available for free with a new phone. \"We actually hired linguists,\" said Aleksander Alski, head of U.S. and Canada for Poland-based Vasco Electronics, which released translation headphones called E1 in January, and is planning a forthcoming model that can imitate the user's voice, like Google's feature. \"We combined the AI with with human input, and thanks to that, we were able to secure much higher accuracy throughout all the languages we offer.\" There's also home-field advantage. Vasco Electronics' largest market is Europe, and Apple's Live Translation isn't available for EU users, Apple said on its website. Some of the products being introduced by tech companies are less than universal, and are limited to a small number of languages for now. Apple's feature is only available in five languages, versus Pocketalk's 95. Pocketalk's Miller believes that the potential of the technology goes far beyond a tourist ordering a glass of wine in France. He says that it's most powerful when its used in workplaces like schools and hospitals, which require privacy and security features that go beyond what Apple and Google provide. \"This isn't about luxury tourism and travel,\" Miller said. \"This is about the intersection of language and friction, when a discussion needs to be had.\" Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.",

      "description": "Sri Lanka open their 2025 Asia Cup account with a comprehensive six wicket T20 win against Bangladesh in Abu Dhabi.",
      "content": "Pathum Nissanka became the quickest Sri Lankan batter to reach 2,000 T20 runs as the opener sprinted his team to a six-wicket win over Bangladesh in a crucial Asia Cup match on Saturday.\n\nNissanka perfectly manipulated the line and lengths of the Bangladeshi bowlers to score 50 off 34 balls, and Sri Lanka breezed to 140-4 in a strong start to its campaign.\n\nBangladesh, which handed Hong Kong a seven-wicket drubbing in its first Group B game, recovered from a horror start to score 139-5 after it lost both openers to fast bowler Nuwan Thushara and Dushmantha Chameera’s successive wicket maidens with the new ball.\n\nNissanka batted fluently and scored six fours and a six as he reached the 2,000-run landmark in his 68th T20 innings when he completed his half-century. Kusal Perera had the previous Sri Lanka record, achieving the feat in 76 innings.\n\nNissanka fell soon after his entertaining 95-run stand with Kamil Mishara (46 not out) had all but sealed the game, when Shoriful Islam held on to a spectacular two-handed catch at deep backward square leg.\n\nBangladesh had to pay a heavy price for dropping Mishra on 1 when Mahedi Hassan could not hold on to a two-handed catch close to the 30-metre circle at wide mid-on. Although Perera and Dasun Shanaka also perished quickly while going for big shots, Mishara’s unbeaten knock of 32 balls ensured Sri Lanka finished off the game with more than five overs to spare.\n\nEarlier, after being put into bat, Shamim Hossain (42) and Jaker Ali (41) helped Bangladesh recover from a disastrous start in the second half of their innings when they combined in an 86-run unbroken stand off 61 balls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWanindu Hasaranga made an impactful return to international cricket with figures of 2-25 after missing the last series against Zimbabwe due to a hamstring injury. The leg spinner should have had the wicket of Jaker in his eventful second over, only to see his sharp googly grazing the off stump after going through the defences of the batter, but both bails stayed on the stumps.\n\nHasaranga’s sharp spinning deliveries and the twin strikes of Thushara and Chameera saw Bangladesh slump to 53-5 in the 10th over when captain Litton Das (28) was out leg before wicket while attempting a reverse sweep against Hasaranga.\n\nChameera bowled some impressive yorkers in the death overs and finished with identical figures of 4-1-17-1 with Thushara. Shamim hit the lone six in Bangladesh’s otherwise defensive innings when he smacked the only off-colour Sri Lanka bowler — Matheesha Pathirara (0-42) — over midwicket.",

      "content": "Even as Nintendo has endlessly mined its classic consoles for nostalgic re-releases in recent decades, the company has seemed to completely ignore the existence of the Virtual Boy—its abortive 1990s dip into the world of early virtual reality. That's finally set to change next February with Nintendo's first-ever official re-release of Virtual Boy games—at least for players who invest $100 in a required Virtual Boy-shaped Switch dock (or a cheaper cardboard holder) to make them work.\n\nVirtual Boy – Nintendo Classics will be available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members on #NintendoSwitch and #NintendoSwitch2 starting Feb 17, 2026! #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com/VnCO0DiX3S — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) September 12, 2025\n\nSubscribers to Nintendo Switch Online in the US and Canada will soon be able to purchase that $100 dock, which Nintendo says \"recreates the form of the original Virtual Boy hardware,\" or a slender $25 cardboard alternative. Then, starting on February 17, those players will be able to play downloaded Virtual Boy games (included with an Expansion Pack subscription) by inserting a Switch or Switch 2 into one of those retro replicas. The system will presumably display those games in a split-screen mode that can be viewed through special lenses to replicate the Virtual Boy's original 384×224 resolution, four-shades-of-red stereoscopic display.\n\nNintendo's announcement says you'll \"need this dedicated accessory\" to play Virtual Boy titles through a Switch, suggesting that flat-screen play on a console without one of the custom docks won't be possible. And while \"purchase limits apply\" to the plastic Virtual Boy replica (which seems likely to be a collectible available only in limited supplies), the cheaper cardboard model seems designed for wider availability.\n\nCredit: Nintendo Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi poses with the Virtual Boy-shaped Switch dock needed to play these games. Credit: Nintendo Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi poses with the Virtual Boy-shaped Switch dock needed to play these games.\n\nNintendo also says that \"Joy-Con or Joy-Con 2 controllers are required to play,\" suggesting we won't be getting replicas of the Virtual Boy's unique, dual D-pad controller (as we have for other classic Nintendo pads).",

      "content": "In my old age I’ve mostly given up trying to convince anyone of anything. Most people do not care to find the truth, they care about what pumps their bags. Some people go as far as to believe that perception is reality and that truth is a construction. I hope there’s a special place in hell for those people.\n\nIt’s why the world wasted $10B+ on self driving car companies that obviously made no sense. There’s a much bigger market for truths that pump bags vs truths that don’t.\n\nSo here’s your new truth that there’s no market for. Do you believe a compiler can code? If so, then go right on believing that AI can code. But if you don’t, then AI is no better than a compiler, and arguably in its current form, worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best model of a programming AI is a compiler.\n\nYou give it a prompt, which is “the code”, and it outputs a compiled version of that code. Sometimes you’ll use it interactively, giving updates to the prompt after it has returned code, but you find that, like most IDEs, this doesn’t work all that well and you are often better off adjusting the original prompt and “recompiling”.\n\nWhile noobs and managers are excited that the input language to this compiler is English, English is a poor language choice for many reasons.\n\nIt’s not precise in specifying things. The only reason it works for many common programming workflows is because they are common. The minute you try to do new things, you need to be as verbose as the underlying language. AI workflows are, in practice, highly non-deterministic. While different versions of a compiler might give different outputs, they all promise to obey the spec of the language, and if they don’t, there’s a bug in the compiler. English has no similar spec. Prompts are highly non local, changes made in one part of the prompt can affect the entire output.\n\ntl;dr, you think AI coding is good because compilers, languages, and libraries are bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t to say “AI” technology won’t lead to some extremely good tools. But I argue this comes from increased amounts of search and optimization and patterns to crib from, not from any magic “the AI is doing the coding”. You are still doing the coding, you are just using a different programming language.\n\nThat anyone uses LLMs to code is a testament to just how bad tooling and languages are. And that LLMs can replace developers at companies is a testament to how bad that company’s codebase and hiring bar is.\n\nAI will eventually replace programming jobs in the same way compilers replaced programming jobs. In the same way spreadsheets replaced accounting jobs.\n\nBut the sooner we start thinking about it as a tool in a workflow and a compiler—through a lens where tons of careful thought has been put in—the better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can’t believe anyone bought those vibe coding crap things for billions. Many people in self driving accused me of just being upset that I didn’t get the billions, and I’m sure it’s the same thoughts this time. Is your way of thinking so fucking broken that you can’t believe anyone cares more about the actual truth than make believe dollars?\n\nFrom this study, AI makes you feel 20% more productive but in reality makes you 19% slower. How many more billions are we going to waste on this?\n\nOr we could, you know, do the hard work and build better programming languages, compilers, and libraries. But that can’t be hyped up for billions.",

      "content": "Activists from 40 countries sail from Tunisia to defy Israel’s blockade and deliver aid to Gaza.\n\nAn international convoy of boats, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), has set sail from Tunisia, aiming to defy Israel’s siege on Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid.\n\nThe GSF, which departed Bizerte Port on Saturday, includes more than 40 vessels carrying between 500 and 700 activists from more than 40 countries, according to Anadolu.\n\nParticipants say they are determined to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza.\n\nAmong those joining is Franco-Palestinian lawmaker Rima Hassan, a member of the French National Assembly, who announced her participation after boarding in Tunisia.\n\n“Our governments are responsible for the continuation of the genocide in Gaza,” Hassan wrote on X, accusing European leaders of silence in the face of Israeli attacks on aid convoys. In June, she joined another Gaza-bound boat that Israeli forces seized in international waters.\n\nhe flotilla is supported by prominent activists, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, who has long been vilified by Israeli officials for her solidarity with Palestinians.\n\nThe flotilla reported this week that two of its ships – the Family, which had members of the steering committee on board, and the Alma – were attacked while anchored near Tunis.\n\nActivists suspect Israeli involvement, noting that one of the vessels was struck by a drone.\n\nTunisia’s Ministry of the Interior confirmed a “premeditated aggression” and said an investigation had been launched.\n\nDespite the attacks, flotilla organisers insist they will press ahead. “Faced with this inaction, I am joining this citizens’ initiative, which is the largest humanitarian maritime convoy ever undertaken,” Hassan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory of intervention\n\nThis is not the first time Israel has moved to stop such missions.\n\nIn early June, Israeli naval forces intercepted the Madleen ship in international waters, seizing its aid supplies and detaining the crew of 12 activists.

      "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://sibellavia.lol/posts/2025/09/safe-c-proposal-is-not-being-continued/\">https://sibellavia.lol/posts/2025/09/safe-c-proposal-is-not-being-continued/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45234460\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45234460</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>",
      "content": "One year ago, the Safe C++ proposal was made. The goal was to add a safe subset/context into C++ that would give strong guarantees (memory safety, type safety, thread safety) similar to what Rust provides, without breaking existing C++ code. It was an extension or superset of C++. The opt-in mechanism was to explicitly mark parts of the code that belong to the safe context. The authors even state:\n\nCode in the safe context exhibits the same strong safety guarantees as code written in Rust.\n\nThe rest remains “unsafe” in the usual C++ sense. This means that existing code continues to work, while new or refactored parts can gain safety. For those who write Rust, Safe C++ has many similarities with Rust, sometimes with adjustments to fit C++’s design. Also, because C++ already has a huge base of “unsafe code”, Safe C++ has to provide mechanisms for mixing safe and unsafe, and for incremental migration. In that sense, all of Safe C++’s safe features are opt-in. Existing code compiles and works as before. Introducing safe context doesn’t break code that doesn’t use it.\n\nThe proposal caught my interest. It seemed like a good compromise to make C++ safe, although there were open or unresolved issues, which is completely normal for a draft proposal. For example, how error reporting for the borrow checker and lifetime errors would work, or how generic code and templates would interact with lifetime logic and safe/unsafe qualifiers. These are just some of the points, the proposal is very long and elaborate. Moreover, I am not a programming language designer, so there might be better alternatives.\n\nAnyway, today I discovered that the proposal will no longer be pursued. When I thought about the proposal again this morning, I realized I hadn’t read any updates on it for some time. So I searched and found some answers on Reddit.\n\nThe response from Sean Baxter, one of the original authors of the Safe C++ proposal:\n\nThe Safety and Security working group voted to prioririze Profiles over Safe C++. Ask the Profiles people for an update. Safe C++ is not being continued.\n\nAnd again:\n\nThe Rust safety model is unpopular with the committee. Further work on my end won’t change that. Profiles won the argument. All effort should go into getting Profile’s language for eliminating use-after-free bugs, data races, deadlocks and resource leaks into the Standard, so that developers can benefit from it.\n\nSo I went to read the documents related to Profiles[1][2][3][4]. I try to summarize what I understood: they are meant to define modes of C++ that impose constraints on how you use the language and library, in order to guarantee certain safety properties. They are primarily compile-time constraints, though in practice some checks may be implemented using library facilities that add limited runtime overhead. Instead of introducing entirely new language constructs, profiles mostly restrict existing features and usages. The idea is that you can enable a profile, and any code using it agrees to follow the restrictions. If you don’t enable it, things work as before. So it’s backwards-compatible.\n\nProfiles seem less radical and more adoptable, a safer-by-default C++ without forcing the Rust model that aims to tackle the most common C++ pitfalls. I think Safe C++ was more ambitious: introducing new syntax, type qualifiers, safe vs unsafe contexts, etc. Some in the committee felt that was too heavy, and Profiles are seen as a more pragmatic path. The main objection is obvious: one could say that Profiles restrict less than what Safe C++ aimed to provide.\n\nReading comments here and there, there is visible resistance in the community toward adopting the Rust model, and from a certain point of view, I understand it. If you want to write like Rust, just write Rust. Historically, C++ is a language that has often taken features from other worlds and integrated them into itself. In this case, I think that safety subsets of C++ already exist informally somehow. Profiles are an attempt to standardize and unify something that already exists in practice. Technically, they don’t add new fundamental semantics. Instead, they provide constraints, obligations and guarantees.\n\nIn my opinion, considering the preferences of the committee and the entire C++ community, although I appreciated the Safe C++ proposal and was looking forward to seeing concrete results, considering the C++ context I believe that standardizing and integrating the Profiles as proposed is a much more realistic approach. Profiles might not be perfect, but they are better than nothing. They will likely be uneven in enforcement and weaker than Safe C++ in principle. They won’t give us silver-bullet guarantees, but they are a realistic path forward.\n\n[1] Core safety profiles for C++26\n\n[2] C++ Profiles: The Framework\n\n[3] What are profiles?\n\n[4] Note to the C++ standards committee members",

      "description": "The House of Representatives was dissolved by the country's president, following deadly anti-corruption protests.",
      "content": "Nepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstated\n\nProtesters on Tuesday stormed and set fire to the Singha Durbar palace, which houses parliament and government buildings\n\nMore than 50 people were killed in clashes with riot police during this week's mass protests sparked by a ban on social media platforms. Karki was appointed after a deal was reached with protest leaders.\n\nPoudel dissolved the House of Representatives on Friday upon the recommendation of newly appointed interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki - it was also a key demand from the protest movement.\n\nIn a statement, eight parties - including the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and Maoist Centre - said President Ram Chandra Poudel acted unconstitutionally.\n\nNepal's major political parties have demanded the country's president reinstates the parliament he dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests.\n\nThe ban was lifted on Monday - but by then the protests had swelled into a mass movement. Angry crowds set fire to parliament and government buildings in the capital Kathmandu on Tuesday, forcing then-Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to resign.\n\nSaturday's statement demanding the reinstatement of the parliament was signed by the chief whips of the eight political parties.\n\nThey argued the step taken by the president was unconstitutional and against the precedents set by Nepal's judiciary.\n\nThe dissolution of the parliament was a major demand by student leaders from the so-called \"Gen Z\" protest movement.\n\nBut the eight parties say the protesters' demands - including new elections announced for 5 March next year - should be addressed through an institution voted by the people.\n\nLater on Saturday, President Poudel urged all sides to show restraint and help conduct the elections.\n\nIn a statement, he said a peaceful resolution was being achieved in a \"very... difficult and scary situation\".\n\n\"The constitution is alive, the parliamentary system is alive and the federal democratic republic still exists. People have an opportunity to move forward in the path of a more efficient democracy by conducting elections within six months,\" the president said.\n\nKarki, a 73-year-old former Supreme Court chief justice and the first woman to lead the impoverished Himalayan nation, was sworn in during a brief ceremony in the capital Kathmandu.\n\nShe is expected to appoint ministers to her cabinet within a few days.\n\nShe is widely regarded as having a clean image, and her leadership of the interim government is being supported by student leaders from the \"Gen Z\" movement.\n\nBut her cabinet will face multiple challenges, including restoring law and order, reconstructing parliament and the other key buildings that were attacked, reassuring the Gen Z protesters who want change - and others in Nepal who are fearful its young democracy and constitutional order could be derailed.\n\nAnother key task will be to bring those responsible for violence to justice.\n\nNepal is gradually returning back to normalcy after the worst unrest in decades.\n\nNepal's soldiers - who had been deployed to patrol the streets of Kathmandu - returned to their bases after Karki took the oath of office.\n\nThe protests were triggered by the government's decision last week to ban 26 social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook - but they soon widened to embody much deeper discontent with Nepal's political elite.\n\nIn the weeks before the ban, a \"nepo kid\" campaign - spotlighting the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children and allegations of corruption - had taken off on social media.\n\nAnd while the social media ban was hastily lifted on Monday night, the protests had by that stage gained unstoppable momentum.",

      "title": "Syria’s oil heartland poisoned by decades of war, neglect, and inaction",
      "description": "War and neglect have turned Deir Az Zor’s oilfields into rivers of carcinogenic waste seeping into Syrian soil.",
      "content": "War and neglect have turned Deir Az Zor’s oilfields into rivers of carcinogenic waste seeping into Syrian soil.\n\nDeir Az Zor, Syria – The first thing that strikes you about the desert of eastern Syria is the vast still landscape: its silence, the unrelenting heat, and dry hot gusts of wind. The journey to Deir Az Zor feels like travelling back in time, with few markers of modernity evident as you look out from the road.\n\nBut then a vast, shimmering body of sludge emerges, a black scar through the beige desert. The smell is a thick, chemical tang of petroleum that coats the back of your throat. It looks almost beautiful, until you remember – it is a river of death.\n\nWe reached the al-Taim oilfield in Deir Az Zor province to see one of the few oil facilities in Syria controlled by the government in Damascus.\n\nAfter years of war, some damage to the oilfield was to be expected, but not this – a toxic expanse testament to one of the Syrian conflict’s most poisonous and lasting legacies.\n\nThe oil spill is not the aftermath of a single battle, but the product of decades of neglect and war. What spills here is a carcinogenic mix of produced water – a byproduct of the oil and gas extraction process – and crude oil, which used to be deposited safely underground.\n\nBut years of war have destroyed the infrastructure that did that, and it has never been repaired. The mixture therefore flows unchecked, 24 hours a day, seeping into the desert soil, where it inches towards the aquifer below and snakes its way closer to the Euphrates River, the lifeblood of Deir Az Zor.\n\nLack of government support\n\nThe absence of proper government that led to this environmental disaster can be seen elsewhere in Deir Az Zor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe province – located in Syria’s far east and separated from the country’s populous and fertile west by miles of desert – has long been on the margins of the Syrian state, neglected for decades even before the war.\n\nToday, that lack of governance is evident in broken bridges, gutted villages and oilfields left to rot. Few journalists make the trip due to the drive from Damascus. It can take up to half a day – through a few checkpoints and stretches of empty road where security is never guaranteed – and journeys should be complete before it gets dark.\n\nAt the decades-old pumps that pull the oil from the ground, we found a few guards seeking refuge from the heat in their tarp-lined security post. They approached us with rifles slung casually across their shoulders, one riding a gleaming Chinese-built motorcycle, the black logo of ISIL (ISIS) emblazoned on the headlight.\n\nOne of the men laughs when I point it out.\n\n“We bought it like that,” he says with a shrug. “No one bothered to scrape it off.” It’s a chilling reminder that the ghosts of the recent past remain etched not just in memory but into the machinery of daily life.\n\nMohammed al-Touma, one of the safety engineers at the pump, steered things back to the crisis at hand.\n\n“It kills the birds instantly,” he said, as he approached to tell us about the black, hazardous sludge that we had seen. “No one cares, please tell the world about this toxic, radioactive waste.”\n\nThe oilfield’s workers had left between 2012 and 2013, when ISIL began infiltrating into Deir Az Zor before fully taking over the province in 2014.\n\nThe workers returned once the group had been defeated in the area in 2017, only to find this expanding river of oil residue no longer being pumped back into the oil table deep underground. Nothing has changed since then, even after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December and the end of Syria’s war.\n\nThe new Syrian government faces security and governance challenges across the country, as it attempts to turn the page after 13 years of conflict. Fighting has periodically taken place involving government forces and local militias, leading to hundreds of deaths, and Israel continues to bomb the country and seize more territory.\n\nAnd with reconstruction needed across the country, this oilfield in Deir Az Zor is not at the top of the government’s priority list.\n\nSymbol of war\n\nWalk around the field, and the damage is like a tapestry woven by every faction that fought here.\n\nThere are bullet holes in pipelines, gaping holes in massive fuel tanks, and the mangled remains of steel structures and instruments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nISIL drained the field to bankroll its state. The United States-led coalition and Russian jets bombed the oilfield to starve that funding.\n\nAssad-regime forces, Iranian-backed militias and local tribes fought bloody battles for its control. The result: a poisoned inheritance for all the civilians of Deir Az Zor.\n\nTo grasp the scale of the disaster, we launched a drone. As it climbed in the air, it became clear that the oil spill was no pond.\n\nIt is a vast, dark river, stretching relentlessly. A 10-kilometre-long (six-mile) scar that is still growing. From above, the scale is staggering, so we asked for satellite imagery. And from space, the time-lapse is even starker; what began as a puddle after the first strikes has metastasised into a lagoon visible from the satellite’s orbit.\n\n“You have to understand, before all this, that wasn’t here,” Firas al-Hamad, al-Taim oilfield’s operations manager, told me. “This water mixed with oil, we used to inject it deep underground. Protocol. [But] for years now it just poured out 24-7.”\n\nHis explanation was simple, and the science seems pretty straightforward. This is the produced water, a toxic byproduct of oil extraction. The solution is also simple: new disposal wells need to be drilled.\n\nBut this is Syria, and we’re in neglected Deir Az Zor, where hospitals run without stretchers and electricity is a few-hours-a-day luxury. Environmental repair does not even register on the list of priorities.\n\n“We’ve asked,” one local official admitted, referring to both the current and former Syrian governments. “We’ve been promised. Nothing happens.”\n\nWhen contacted, the central government in Damascus gave no response.\n\nThe greatest fear is just 15 kilometres (nine miles) away: the Euphrates River, a lifeline for millions across Syria and Iraq.\n\nFor now, the toxic slick has not reached it. But the desert is unforgiving. One heavy storm, one flash flood, and the poison could flow into the river, contaminating crops, wells and drinking water downstream.\n\nOut in the open yet hidden, it is a lingering cost of war.\n\nHere, in the silence of Syria’s oil heartland, a river of poison spreads unchecked.\n\nOil, the resource that once sustained this region, providing jobs and prosperity, now threatens to destroy it. And the people of Deir Az Zor are left waiting, caught between the ruins of yesterday and a growing catastrophe in front of their eyes.\n\nA catastrophe that the world is paying little attention to, and a flowing testament that serves as one of the Syrian war’s unspoken legacies.",

      "title": "Education report calling for ethical AI use contains over 15 fake sources",
      "description": "Experts find fake sources in Canadian government report that took 18 months to complete.",
      "content": "On Friday, CBC News reported that a major education reform document prepared for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador contains at least 15 fabricated citations that academics suspect were generated by an AI language model—despite the same report calling for \"ethical\" AI use in schools.\n\n\"A Vision for the Future: Transforming and Modernizing Education,\" released August 28, serves as a 10-year roadmap for modernizing the province's public schools and post-secondary institutions. The 418-page document took 18 months to complete and was unveiled by co-chairs Anne Burke and Karen Goodnough, both professors at Memorial University's Faculty of Education, alongside Education Minister Bernard Davis.\n\nOne of the fake citations references a 2008 National Film Board movie called \"Schoolyard Games\" that does not exist, according to a board spokesperson. The exact citation reportedly appears in a University of Victoria style guide, a document that teaches students how to format references using fictional examples. The style guide warns on its first page that \"Many citations in this guide are fictitious,\" meaning they are made-up examples used only to demonstrate proper formatting. Yet someone (or some AI chatbot) copied the fake example directly into the Education Accord report as if it were a real source.\n\nAaron Tucker, a Memorial assistant professor whose research focuses on AI history in Canada, told CBC he could not find numerous sources cited in the report despite searching the MUN Library, other academic databases, and Google. \"The fabrication of sources at least begs the question: did this come from generative AI?\" Tucker told CBC. \"Whether that's AI, I don't know, but fabricating sources is a telltale sign of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nSince the inception of AI language models, generating fabricated citations has been a continuous problem. The tendency to confabulate academic citations often causes particular trouble in academic and legal contexts, where fabricated sources can easily slip past lazy human review because they appear properly formatted and contextually appropriate.",

      "description": "Man agreed to return more than 1,000 stolen DVDs to his former employer.",
      "content": "A former employee of a multinational DVD company was sentenced to four years in prison for stealing hundreds of pre-release DVDs and Blu-rays and leaking blockbuster movies online, the Department of Justice confirmed Thursday.\n\nBack in May, Steven Hale pleaded guilty to spending about a year between 2021 and 2022 stealing discs from his employer and selling them online through e-commerce sites. Among movies that Hale uploaded for illegal download were highly anticipated titles like Dune, as well as sequels to popular films like F9: The Fast Saga and Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\n\nBut according to the DOJ, Hale did the most damage by leaking advance copies of Spider-Man: No Way Home. That particular movie, released exclusively in theaters in 2021, became the first movie after the COVID pandemic started to gross $1 billion at the box office. Likely DVD sales were expected to be just as explosive, but for many fans too cautious to return to movie theaters at the time, DVD leaks became too enticing to pass up. Hale wasn't the only one to recognize the high demand online, with illegal downloads of the movie becoming so widespread that ReasonLabs reported that scammers started planting malware in illegal copies of the movie to \"lure in as many victims as possible.\"\n\nIt was in this climate that Hale bypassed DRM encryption, which prevents copying, to rip that movie from the Blu-ray disc, selling the high-quality leak online amidst a sea of inferior bootlegs, more than a month before fans could access it legally. Unsurprisingly, that DVD rip alone was \"downloaded tens of millions of times, with an estimated loss to the copyright owner of tens of millions of dollars,\" the DOJ said.",
