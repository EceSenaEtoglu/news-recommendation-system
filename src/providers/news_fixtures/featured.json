      "title": "Top Wall Street analysts bet on the potential of these 3 stocks for the long haul",
      "description": "TipRanks' ranking service discusses three stocks, including Broadcom and Oracle, that are favored byÂ Wall Street.",
      "content": "In this article ORCL\n\nZS\n\nAVGO Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe latest earnings season has addressed investors' concerns about the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to the robust growth outlook and capital spending projections of many tech companies. Investors seeking exposure to companies that are well-positioned to capture AI-led growth can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who can help pick the stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on past performance.\n\nBroadcom\n\nSemiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO) reported impressive fiscal third-quarter results and issued solid guidance, thanks to AI tailwinds. AVGO stock rallied following the results, as the company stated that it has secured a new $10 billion customer. Citing strong fundamentals, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on Broadcom stock and boosted the price target to $400 from $325, saying that AVGO remains a top pick in semiconductors. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $396. Sur attributed Broadcom's strong results and solid revenue outlook for the October quarter to accelerating AI demand, stabilizing non-AI semiconductors, and impressive momentum in the VMware business. The 5-star analyst noted the 18% sequential growth in AVGO's Q3 FY25 AI revenue, with the company guiding a 19% quarter-over-quarter growth to $6.2 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter. He added that Broadcom is on track to deliver about $20 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2025. Sur believes that the new customer from whom Broadcom secured orders worth $10 billion is OpenAI, considering the AI inference use case and his prior research. The analyst now expects AI revenue to increase by 125% to $45 billion in fiscal 2026, followed by a 60% increase in fiscal 2027. Sur said the strength in AVGO's AI revenue supports his view that the company's internally developed custom AI chips offer meaningful differentiation, efficiency and improved economics. \"Despite macro volatility, Broadcom's diversified portfolio and product cycles support a solid revenue growth profile,\" concluded Sur. Sur ranks No. 39 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks.\n\nZscaler\n\nNext on this week's list is Zscaler (ZS), a cybersecurity company that recently delivered strong results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions. Impressed by the Q4 FY25 print, Stifel analyst Adam Borg reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock and raised the price forecast to $330 from $295. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" stock on ZS stock with a price target of $298. Borg stated that Zscaler delivered solid results, consistent with Stifel's positive checks. He added that the company's Q4 FY25 performance was strong across key metrics, driven by strong execution and demand for the company's broadening Zero-Trust portfolio. Borg was particularly pleased with robust growth in billings and remaining performance obligations. Notably, RPO growth (31%) accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. The 5-star analyst is optimistic about the adoption of Zscaler's offerings across emerging areas, like AI security. Borg is also upbeat about the company's newer solutions like Z-Flex. He continues to believe that \"Zscaler's leading-portfolio helps improve an organization's security posture, drives vendor consolidation, and reduces costs.\" Bord expects Zscaler to sustain at least high-teens top-line growth and margin expansion in the coming years, driven by multiple drivers. Borg ranks No. 324 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 77% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.9%.

      "description": "RestOfWorld.org reports on \"a global crisis nobody anticipated when governments started subsidizing electric vehicles...\" \n\n\"EVs can lose almost half their driving distance when temperatures drop, and the billions spent on improving technology have failed to fix this fundamental limitation.\"\n\nIn January, Seattle-based Recurrent, a company that tests and analyzes EVs, found an average range loss of 20% in extreme cold... Lithium-ion batteries rely on chemical reactions that slow dramatically in cold weather. When temperatures plunge, the electrolyte thickens, ions move sluggishly, and charging becomes not just inefficient but potentially dangerous. Charging in cold weather has been identified as a primary cause of thermal acceleration, which can lead to fires... \nThe failure pattern repeats globally wherever cold weather meets inadequate infrastructure. Manufacturers, too, have acknowledged the problem. Chinese EV maker BYD's user manual, for instance, advises drivers to charge indoors, with the heating on. That advice is useless for farmers parking in open courtyards. \nIn fact, research across 293 Chinese cities \"found that many drivers in colder regions buy EVs only as supplementary vehicles,\" according to the article, \"while still relying on gasoline-powered cars during winter.\" \nThe article also tells the story of an apple grower chilly Kashmir, India who discovered that his Chinese three-wheeler lost 60% of its 10-hour charge overnight. This made it impossible to begin the 56-kilometer (35-mile) trip on a route with no charging stations &mdash; and prevented him from selling his produce while it was fresh (to earn the highest prices). And the problem affects the entire region:\n\nDesperate drivers have formed WhatsApp groups, such as \"EV Apple Transporters\" and \"Battery Help Kashmir,\" sharing increasingly absurd workarounds. Some have wrapped batteries in quilts; others have hauled power packs weighing 90 kilograms (over 200 pounds) into their homes for the night. One driver parked his battery in the living room. \"The blankets caused overheating on the road; water bottles leaked into the circuits,\" [orchard owner] Sajad Ahmad said. \"We became mechanics, engineers, and fools all at once.\" EVs are also not considered cost-efficient. \"Diesel vans are expensive, but they can do four or five trips a day,\" Mohammad Yaseen, a driver based in Shopian, told Rest of World. \"With EVs, one half-trip and you're stuck.\" \n\nNorway, where winter temperatures average minus 7 degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit), achieved 89% EV market share with its comprehensive infrastructure. It offers more than 200 models for year-round usage. \"The ability to preheat batteries upon fast charging in winter is by far the most important improvement we have seen in the past five years,\" Christina Bu, secretary-general of the Norwegian EV Association, told Rest of World.\n \n\"These features are standard in Norway's mature market, but remain absent from basic models exported to developing countries.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+World's+EV+Owners+Discover+Unheated+Batteries+Lose+Distance+in+Freezing+Weather%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0035239%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0035239%2Fthe-worlds-ev-owners-discover-unheated-batteries-lose-distance-in-freezing-weather%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/09/15/0035239/the-worlds-ev-owners-discover-unheated-batteries-lose-distance-in-freezing-weather?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "TechCrunch reports:\n\nThanks to a pledge to unbundle its corporate messaging app Teams from its productivity suites, Microsoft has managed to slip unscathed through a major antitrust investigation by the European Commission that could have resulted in massive fines for the tech giant. \n\nThe Commission on Friday okayed Microsoft's concessions to address the EU's competition concerns over the company including Teams along with the rest of its Office productivity suite for free, concluding a multi-year investigation that was sparked by complaints from rival office messaging app Slack in 2020. Microsoft has promised that for the next seven years, it will provide Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams at a lower price and will let customers choose whether they want to pay more to add the collaboration app to the suites... \nMicrosoft is voluntarily offering some versions of both its productivity suites without Teams at a 50% lower price compared to versions that bundle the app, worldwide. And Microsoft dodged punitive measures and a big fine, as the Commission's penalties for breaching competition rules can reach up to 10% of annual global revenue &mdash; which, considering the tech giant last year recorded $245 billion in revenue, would have been truckloads of money. \nThe article adds one more interesting detail. \"The Commission has also managed to get Microsoft to agree to open up its APIs to enable interoperability for key features between its suite and third-party messaging and collaboration tools, as well as let them export their data out of teams for the next five years...\" The Commission's official announcement says this will \"open up the market for other providers of communication and collaboration tools in Europe.\" \n\nAnd Microsoft will also allow customers with long-term licenses the option of switching to a suite switch without Teams...<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Escapes+EU+Competition+Probe+by+Unbundling+Teams+for+Seven+Years%2C+Opening+API%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F0433205%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F0433205%2Fmicrosoft-escapes-eu-competition-probe-by-unbundling-teams-for-seven-years-opening-api%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/25/09/14/0433205/microsoft-escapes-eu-competition-probe-by-unbundling-teams-for-seven-years-opening-api?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "The conspirators used codenames to conceal their identities as they prepared for their mission: to plunge Brazil into chaos by assassinating a celebrity supreme court judge called Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nOn an encrypted messaging group, one plotter used the alias Brazil, another Japan and a third Austria.\n\nâEach of them had the name of a team,â Moraes said this week as he denounced the alleged plot to murder him as part of an attempt to destroy South Americaâs largest democracy.\n\nThe group of football-loving would-be assassins abandoned their task at the last minute.\n\nâIâm close to the position. Are you going to cancel the game?â the person codenamed Austria asked their associates on their Signal group at just before 9pm on 15 December 2022, as he lurked near Moraesâs home in Brazilâs capital, BrasÃ­lia.\n\nâAbort,â replied âGermanyâ, according to a federal police report.\n\nThe cinematic plot, nicknamed Operation Copa 2022 (Operation World Cup 2022) and involving at least six special forces troops, was at the heart of this weekâs historic trial of Brazilâs former president, Jair Bolsonaro. He was on Thursday sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stage a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, known as Lula.\n\nâ[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state,â said Moraes as he accused Bolsonaro of being the leader of a sprawling conspiracy, which included plans to assassinate Lula and the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, to stop them taking power on 1 January 2023.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jair Bolsonaroâs supporters at a protest this month. Photograph: Luis Nova/AP\n\nMoraes said hitmen had planned to âneutraliseâ him using âextremely powerful weaponsâ capable of piercing his bullet-proof car; they also allegedly considered killing Lula during a public event with poison or drugs that would cause organ failure.\n\nâIâm someone who should be really thankful to be alive,â Lula said last year after the alleged poison plot was revealed.\n\nBolsonaro has denied engineering a coup or being involved in an assassination plot, calling such claims âa little storyâ.\n\nBut Moraes said there was âample evidenceâ indicating the far-right politician was aware of Operation World Cup 2022, which the judge said was part of a larger intrigue called Green and Yellow Dagger.\n\nPolice investigators said a copy of the blueprint for a âclandestine operationâ with âterrorist hallmarksâ was printed out in the presidential palace on 6 December 2022 by an army general called MÃ¡rio Fernandes. At the time Gen Fernandes, who was arrested last year, was a senior official in Bolsonaroâs administration.\n\nâThis [plan] wasnât printed out in a cave. It wasnât printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government â¦ at the same moment that president Jair Messias Bolsonaro was there,â Moraes told the court on Tuesday as Bolsonaroâs trial reached its conclusion.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alexandre de Moraes and Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, who said he was âsomeone who should be really thankful to be aliveâ. Photograph: Adriano Machado/Reuters\n\nâThe planning is so detailed that it even details the chances of success, what the collateral damage might be, what weaponry should be used,â added Moraes.\n\nA copy of the Green and Yellow Dagger plan, obtained by federal police investigators, suggests plotters planned to use an arsenal that included assault rifles, a belt-fed machine gun and even a Swedish anti-tank weapon, used on the battlefield in Ukraine. âThese are weapons of war commonly used by combat groups,â the police report says.\n\nAccording to the investigators, the plan to assassinate Moraes was aborted only because a court session was delayed â and, more importantly, the commanders of the army and air force refused to endorse Bolsonaroâs coup plot.\n\nBrazil has had more than a dozen coup attempts since it became a republic in 1889 but none, so far as is known, involved a plan to assassinate those being deposed.\n\nThe historian Lucas Pedretti said that did not necessarily mean such plots had not existed. Rather, the 2022 plot had come to light because, for the first time in history, the coup plotters had been investigated and put on trial.\n\nPedretti said the existence of the assassination plan was âshocking, but not so surprisingâ. The historian, who studies Brazilâs brutal 1964-85 military dictatorship, said the armed forces still promoted internally the idea that the bloody regime was a ânecessary and legitimate responseâ to a supposed communist threat.\n\nQuick Guide Brazil's dictatorship 1964-1985 Show How did it begin? Brazilâs leftist president, JoÃ£o Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule. The repression intensified under Castelo Brancoâs hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called âanos de chumboâ (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974. What happened during the dictatorship? Supporters of Brazilâs 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic âmiracleâ. It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rioâs Guanabara bay. But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazilâs first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel. It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazilâs best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures. How did it end? Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy. But the pro-democracy âDiretas JÃ¡â (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo and Belo Horizonte.

      "description": "TIOBE attempts to calculate programming language popularity using the number of skilled engineers, courses, and third-party vendors. \nAnd the eight most popular languages in September's rankings haven't changed since last month:\n\n 1. Python\n2. C++\n3. C \n4. Java\n5. C#\n6. JavaScript\n7. Visual Basic\n8. Go \n\n\n\nBut by TIOBE's ranking, Perl is still the #10 most-popular programming in September (dropping from #9 in August). \"One year ago Perl was at position 27 and now it suddenly pops up at position 10 again,\" marvels TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen.\nThe technical reason why Perl is rated this high is because of its huge number of books on Amazon. It has 4 times more books listed than for instance PHP, or 7 times more books than Rust. The underlying \"real\" reason for Perl's increase of popularity is unknown to me. The only possibility I can think of is that Perl 5 is now gradually considered to become the real Perl... Perl 6/Raku is at position 129 of the TIOBE index, thus playing no role at all in the programming world. Perl 5 on the other hand is releasing more often recently, thus gaining attention. \nAn article at the i-Programmer blog thinks Perl's resurgence could be from its text processing capabilities:\n\nEven in this era of AI, everything is still governed by text formats; text is still the King. XML, JSON calling APIs, YAML, Markdown, Log files..That means that there's still need to process it, transform it, clean it, extract from it. Perl with its first-class-citizen regular expressions, the wealth of text manipulation libraries up on CPAN and its full Unicode support of all the latest standards, was and is still the best. Simply there's no other that can match Perl's text processing capabilities. \nThey also cite Perl's backing by the open source community, and its \"getting a 'proper' OOP model in the last couple of years... People just don't know what Perl is capable of and instead prefer to be victims of FOMO ephemeral trends, chasing behind the new and shiny.\" \n\nPerl creator Larry Wall answered questions from Slashdot's readers in 2016. So I'd be curious from Slashdot's readers about Perl today. (Share your experiences in the comments if you're still using Perl -- or Raku...) \n\nPerl's drop to #9 means Delphi/Object Pascal rises up one rank, growing from 1.82% in August to 2.26% in September to claim September's #9 spot. \"At number 11 and 1.86%, SQL is quite close to entering the top 10 again,\" notes TechRepublic. (SQL fell to #12 in June, which the site speculated was due to \"the increased use of NoSQL databases for AI applications.\") \nBut TechRepublic adds that the #1 most popular programming language (according to TIOBE) is still Python:\n\nPerl sits at 2.03% in TIOBE's proprietary ranking system in September, up from 0.64% in January. Last year, Perl held the 27th position... Python's unstoppable rise dipped slightly from 26.14% in August to 25.98% in September.

      "content": "Rising seas will threaten 1.5 million Australians by 2050 - report\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Lana Lam Sydney Share Save\n\nEPA Australians are already living with the consequences of climate change\n\nOne and a half million Australians living in coastal areas are at risk from rising sea levels by 2050, a landmark climate report has warned. Australia's first National Climate Risk Assessment predicted more frequent and severe climate hazards like floods, cyclones, heatwaves, droughts and bushfires. \"Australians are already living with the consequences of climate change today,\" Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said, \"but it's clear every degree of warming we prevent now will help future generations avoid the worst impacts in years to come.\" The report looked at three global warming scenarios - above 1.5C, above 2C and above 3C.\n\nAustralia - one of the world's biggest polluters per capita - has already reached warming of above 1.5C, the report said, noting that at 3C, heat-related deaths in Sydney may rise by more than 400% and almost triple in Melbourne. The 72-page report - released days before the government announces its emissions reduction targets for 2035 - found that no Australian community will be immune from climate risks that will be \"cascading, compounding and concurrent\". It warned of more heatwave-related deaths, poorer water quality due to severe flooding and bushfires, and property values to drop by A$611bn ($406bn; Â£300bn). By 2050, the report found the number of coastal communities located in \"high and very high risk areas\" in Australia will increase and if populations levels remain at current levels, this will mean more than 1.5 million people will be at risk. Areas in northern Australia, along with remote communities and outer suburbs of major cities, were particularly at risk, the report said. \"This will put pressure on health, critical infrastructure, natural species and ecosystems, and primary industries,\" the report warned, as well as posing extra challenges for emergency responders. The report also found that coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia - both already hit by record bleaching events - will face higher risks of \"bleaching and biodiversity loss\" due to warmer oceans.",

      "description": "The UK's data-protecting Information Commissioner's Office has issued a warning about what it calls a worrying trend, reports the BBC: \"students hacking their own school and college IT systems for fun or as part of dares.\"\n\n\n\nSince 2022, the the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has investigated 215 hacks and breaches originating from inside education settings and says 57% were carried out by children. Other breaches are thought to come from staff, third party IT suppliers and other organisations with access. According to the new data, almost a third of the breaches involved students illegally logging into staff computer systems by guessing passwords or stealing details from teachers. \n\nIn one incident, a seven-year-old was involved in a data breach and subsequently referred to the National Crime Agency's Cyber Choices programme to help them understand the seriousness of their actions... In another incident three Year 11 students aged 15 or 16 unlawfully accessed school databases containing the personal information of more than 1,400 students. The pupils used hacking tools downloaded from the internet to break passwords and security protocols. When questioned, they said they were interested in cyber security and wanted to test their skills and knowledge. Another example the ICO gave is of a student illegally logging into their college's databases with a teachers' details to change or delete personal information belonging to more than 9,000 staff, students and applicants. The system stored personal information such as name and home address, school records, health data, safeguarding and pastoral logs and emergency contacts. \n\nSchools are facing an increasing number of cyber attacks, with 44% of schools reporting an attack or breach in the last year according the government's most recent Cyber Security Breaches Survey. \n\n\"Youth cyber crime culture is a growing threat linked to English-speaking teen gangs,\" the article argues, noting breaches at major companies to suggest it's a kind of \"gateway\" crime. \n\nThe ICO's principal cyber specialist tells the BBC that \"What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks on organisations or critical infrastructure.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=UK's+Data+Watchdog+Warns+Students+Are+Breaching+Their+Schools'+IT+Systems%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0150246%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0150246%2Fuks-data-watchdog-warns-students-are-breaching-their-schools-it-systems%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/09/15/0150246/uks-data-watchdog-warns-students-are-breaching-their-schools-it-systems?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "America's Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Amazon and Google misled advertisers placing ads on their websites, reports Bloomberg, and specifically whether the two companies \"properly disclosed the terms and pricing for ads.\"\n\nThe FTC is seeking details about Amazon's auctions and whether it disclosed \"reserve pricing\" for some search ads &mdash; price floors that advertisers must meet before they can buy an ad, the people said. Separately, the FTC is examining practices by Google, including its internal pricing process and whether it increased the cost of ads in ways that weren't disclosed to advertisers, the people said... \n\nAccording to one of the people, the FTC's latest investigation emerged from its earlier antitrust case. In that complaint, the agency alleges that Amazon litters its marketplace with irrelevant results for search queries, making it harder for shoppers to find what they are looking for and more expensive for sellers to use the platform. The practice effectively forces sellers to buy ads to make their product appear in response to consumer searches.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=America's+FTC+Opens+New+Probe+into+Amazon+and+Google+Advertising+Practices%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F1638247%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F1638247%2Famericas-ftc-opens-new-probe-into-amazon-and-google-advertising-practices%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/09/14/1638247/americas-ftc-opens-new-probe-into-amazon-and-google-advertising-practices?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "Meanwhile, Congress is trying to keep serious scientists from weighing in.",
      "content": "While the Trump administration has continued to refer to efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change as a scam, it has done almost nothing to counter the copious scientific evidence that demonstrates that climate change is real and doing real damage to the citizens of the US. The lone exception has been a draft Department of Energy report prepared by a handful of carefully chosen fringe figures that questioned the mainstream understanding of climate change. The shoddy work and questionable conclusions of that report were so extensive that an analysis of it required over 450 pages to detail all of its shortcomings.\n\nBut its shortcomings may not have been limited to the science, as a lawsuit alleges that its preparation violated a law that regulates the activities of federal advisory panels. Now, in an attempt to avoid dealing with that lawsuit, the Department of Energy is claiming that it dissolved the committee that prepared the report, making the lawsuit moot.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress is also attempting to muddy the waters. In response to the DOE report, the National Academies of Science announced that it would prepare a report describing the current state of climate science. Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight have responded by announcing an investigation of the National Academies \"for undermining the EPA.\"\n\nThe vanishing committee\n\nAs we noted in our original coverage, the members of the advisory group that prepared the DOE report were carefully chosen for having views that are well outside the mainstream of climate science. Based on their past public statements, they could be counted on to produce a report that would question the severity of climate change and raise doubts about whether we had any evidence it was happening. The report they produced went beyond that by suggesting that the net effect of our carbon emissions was likely to be a positive for humanity.",

      "description": "In NYT op-ed, Lula praises &#039;historic&#039; sentencing of Bolsonaro on coup charges, slams US levies on Brazil as misguided.",
      "content": "In NYT op-ed, Brazilâs leader praises âhistoricâ sentencing of his predecessor on coup charges, slams US tariffs as âmisguidedâ.\n\nBrazilâs president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has dismissed criticism from the United States over the conviction of the countryâs former leader, Jair Bolsonaro, on coup charges, and slammed Washingtonâs sweeping tariffs on Brazilian products as âmisguidedâ and âillogicalâ.\n\nThe comments, published in an op-ed in The New York Times on Sunday, came as Bolsonaro, 70, made his first public appearance since last weekâs conviction for a hospital visit.\n\nIn his essay, Lula said he wanted to establish âan open and frank dialogueâ with US President Donald Trump over his administrationâs decision to impose a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian products, including coffee and beef exports, in the wake of Bolsonaroâs trial.\n\nHe noted that the US has a trade surplus with Brazil, accumulating a surplus of $410bn in trade over the past 15 years, making it âclear that the motivation of the White House is politicalâ.\n\nThe tariffs, Lula wrote, are aimed at seeking âimpunityâ for Bolsanaro, whom he said orchestrated the riots in Brasilia on January 8, 2023, when the former leaderâs supporters stormed the presidential palace, the Supreme Court and the Congress in protest over his election defeat the previous year.\n\nThe events in the Brazilian capital echoed the storming of the US Capitol by Trumpâs supporters on January 6, 2021, after he insisted for months, without evidence, that there had been widespread fraud during the election he lost to his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLula described Bolsonaroâs actions as âan effort to subvert the popular will at the ballot boxâ and said he was proud of the Brazilian Supreme Courtâs âhistoric decisionâ on Thursday to sentence the former president to 27 years and three months in prison.\n\nâThis was not a âwitch huntâ,â he wrote.\n\nâThe judgment was the result of proceedings carried out in accordance with Brazilâs 1988 Constitution, enacted after two decades of struggle against a military dictatorship,â he said. âIt followed months of investigations that uncovered plans to assassinate me, the vice president and a Supreme Court justice. Authorities also discovered a draft decree that would have effectively annulled the 2022 election results,â he said.\n\nBolsonaroâs conviction, he continued, âsafeguardsâ Brazilâs institutions and the democratic rule of law.\n\nBrazilâs democracy ânot on tableâ\n\nLulaâs op-ed comes after Trumpâs secretary of state, Marco Rubio, threatened more action against Brazil over Bolsonaroâs conviction. In addition to the tariffs, the US has so far sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaroâs trial, and revoked visas for most of the high courtâs justices.\n\nFor his part, Trump, who has repeatedly labelled the judicial proceedings a âwitch-huntâ, has said he was âsurprisedâ by the ruling. The US president, who also had faced criminal charges over the US Capitol attack before they were withdrawn following his re-election, likened the trial against Bolsonaro to the legal actions against him.\n\nâItâs very much like they tried to do with me, but they didnât get away with it,â Trump told reporters on Thursday, describing Bolsonaro as a âgood presidentâ and a âgood manâ.\n\nIn his op-ed, Lula said the USâs decision to turn its back on a relationship of more than 200 years means that âeveryone losesâ and called for the two countries to continue to work together in areas where they have common goals.\n\nBut, he said Brazilâs democracy was non-negotiable.\n\nâPresident Trump, we remain open to negotiating anything that can bring mutual benefits. But Brazilâs democracy and sovereignty are not on the table,â he wrote.\n\nEconomists in Brazil estimate that Trumpâs tariffs would hurt the countryâs economy, including through the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, but not derail it, given its strong trade ties with other countries such as China. The blow has also been softened when the US later granted hundreds of exceptions, including on aircraft parts and orange juice.\n\nUS consumers, too, are paying more for products imported from Brazil, including coffee, which has already seen recent price rises due to droughts.\n\nIn Brasilia, meanwhile, Bolsonaro, who is under house arrest, left his home to undergo a medical procedure to remove several skin lesions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis doctor, Claudio Birolini, told reporters that the former president had eight lesions removed and sent for biopsies.\n\nHe added that Bolsonaro, who has had multiple operations in recent years due to complications from a 2018 stabbing in his stomach, was âquite weakâ and had developed slight anaemia, âprobably due to poor nutrition over the last monthâ.\n\nThe former president, who was escorted by police, was later released.\n\nDozens of supporters gathered outside the hospital in Brasilia to cheer on Bolsonaro, waving Brazilian flags and shouting, âAmnesty now!â.\n\nThe chant is in reference to the push of Bolsonaroâs allies in Congress to grant the former president some kind of amnesty.\n\nâWeâre here to provide spiritual and psychological support,â Deuselis Filho, 46, told the Associated Press news agency.\n\nDespite Thursdayâs sentence, Bolsonaro will not immediately go to prison.\n\nThe five member court panel now has up to 60 days to publish the ruling. Once it does, Bolsonaroâs lawyers have five days to file motions for clarification.\n\nHis lawyers have said that they will try to appeal both the conviction and sentence before the full Supreme Court of 11 justices, although some experts think it is unlikely to be accepted.",

      "description": "For Panama Canal, drought is an economic and existential risk. New dam and land bridge projects will help trade move, but won't be ready before next El NiÃ±o.",
      "content": "After a historic drought that paralyzed vessel transits through the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Authority is moving ahead with major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate future droughts and the risk of low water levels that in recent years plagued the key global trade gateway.\n\nThe Panama Canal depends on fresh water for its operations and is rainfall dependent.\n\n\"We use about two and a half times the amount of water a city of the size of New York uses for the canal operation,\" Ricaurte VÃ¡squez, Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC.\n\nIn a good year of rain, that means over 50 vessel transits through the canal's locks a day, but in recent years, weather has not cooperated. Severe drought conditions hit the region from late 2022 to 2024, forcing the canal to reduce transits and put in place vessel weight restrictions in an effort to conserve water.\n\nThe canal is critical to the U.S. economy and trade. The U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal, with total U.S. commodity export and import containers representing about 73% of Panama Canal traffic, and 40% of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year. In all, roughly $270 billion in cargo is handled annually.\n\nIn April, Canal administration began the pre-qualification and selection process for concessionaires to build a land bridge, including what it describes as a flagship natural gas pipeline line to move natural gas liquids (NGLs) without relying on the canal itself. A road connecting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as port terminals built on either coast, would also be constructed, with the terminals also able to accommodate containers and roll-on and roll-off cargo.\n\nThe pipeline would allow for the transport of liquified petroleum gas, ethane, butane, and propane from the Atlantic side to a Pacific-side terminal, where another vessel would be loaded and carry the product to Asia. Canal officials hope this will attract more LNG transits through the canal.\n\nThe Panama Canal Authority reported a 29% drop in vessel transits during fiscal year 2024, with the biggest hits in LNG and dry bulk transits. LNG transits were down 66 percent, while dry bulk transits were down 107 percent.\n\nEven though water levels are back to regular operating conditions, LNG traffic has not returned to pre-drought transit activity, with carriers continuing to choose the longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, according to S&P Global data.\n\nVasquez tells CNBC that U.S. energy companies are \"drooling at the possibilities\" of this alternative way to move the commodity. Transit time-wise, Vasquez said the pipeline would be competitive versus traversing the canal, and reliability would be higher because it is now water-dependent. \"This is important because with many of these products, reliability and delivering on time are critical,\" he said.\n\n\"We decided to do a land bridge to complement the waterway,\" VÃ¡squez said. \"We are aware that these are high-value products that have a destination in Asia,\" he said, noting the project was announced in Tokyo, which is the largest buyer of these energy products.",

Penske claims in the suit that revenue from affiliate links is down by over 1/3 this year, and it attributes that directly to a drop in traffic from Google.\n\nThe company also claims itâs in a tough situation. It can either block Google from indexing its content, essentially removing itself from all search results, which would further devastate its business.

About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked.\n\nThe suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal.\n\nOn 5 September, a man was shot dead at a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, the third killing in a Cape Town court since April.\n\nCape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according to data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz, a Mexican NGO.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according to city authorities, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950.\n\nâOur communities are fearful,â Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. âWe donât have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.â\n\nWestern Cape police said last week they were carrying out âtargeted operationsâ in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: âThe message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.â\n\nThe acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for âintelligence-driven operationsâ to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime, local media reported.\n\nâThere is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,â said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance.\n\nMore than 26,000 people were murdered in South Africa last year, South African police data shows. Almost 3,500 of those were in Cape Town, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz.",

      "description": "Klarna's bumper IPO has got investors wondering about which fintech names could be next to go public.",
      "content": "In this article KLAR Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nSpecialist traders work at the post for Swedish fintech Klarna, during the companyâs IPO at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Sept. 10, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nAfter Swedish payments group Klarna's $17 billion initial public offering, investors are pondering which big fintech name will be the next to go public. Klarna popped as much as 30% on the day of its New York IPO, before settling to close around 15% higher. The stock declined further to $42.92 by Friday but is still up about 7% from its IPO price of $40. The debut demonstrated how Wall Street is becoming more welcoming of bumper fintech listings. Prior to Klarna, online trading platform eToro, stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish all went public to a positive first-day reception. Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, surged 14% in its IPO Friday. \"I think the Klarna IPO would be viewed positively by some of the other scaled-up vendors,\" Gautam Pillai, head of fintech research at British investment bank Peel Hunt, told CNBC. There's a crowded pipeline of fintech names that could be next to IPO after Klarna. CNBC looks at which companies look the most promising.\n\nStripe\n\nPatrick Collison, chief executive officer and co-founder of Stripe Inc., left, smiles as John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Studio 1.0 television interview in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Friday, March 23, 2018. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDigital payments firm Stripe has for years been viewed as an IPO contender. Stripe has remained a private company in the 15 years since it was founded, and founders and brothers John and Patrick Collison have long resisted pressure to take the business public. However, that doesn't mean a stock market listing hasn't been on Stripe's mind. The Collisons told employees in 2023 that Stripe would decide to either go public or allow employees to sell shares via a secondary offering within the next year. Ultimately, Stripe in January opted for a secondary share sale valuing the company at $91.5 billion â close to its peak valuation of $95 billion, which it achieved in 2021. That doesn't mean Stripe couldn't still pursue a stock market debut further down the line. Many fintech unicorn CEOs have been keeping a close eye on Klarna's IPO performance for signs of when will be the right moment to list.\n\nRevolut\n\nRevolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, Nov. 7, 2019. Pedro Nunes | Reuters\n\nRevolut is widely seen as a potential future fintech IPO candidate. The digital banking unicorn told CNBC last week that it recently gave employees the chance to sell shares on the secondary market at a whopping $75 billion valuation, placing it above some major U.K. banks by market value. \"As part of our commitment to our employees, we regularly provide opportunities for them to gain liquidity,\" a Revolut spokesperson told CNBC at the time. \"An employee secondary share sale is currently in process, and we won't be commenting further until it is complete.\" The secondary round buys Revolut some time to remain private for longer while still offering staff the chance to exit some of their holdings. At the same time, though, it now makes Revolut one of the world's most valuable private fintech firms. As to where Revolut lists, for now the U.S. appears the likeliest location. Co-founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky has spoken candidly about his preference to list in the U.S. due to issues with London's IPO market. Last year, he told the 20VC podcast that it was \"just not rational\" to go public in the U.K.\n\nMonzo\n\nMonzo CEO TS Anil. Monzo\n\nHaving recently reached a $5.9 billion valuation in a secondary share sale, British digital bank Monzo is another contender for the public markets. A report surfaced earlier this year from Sky News that said Monzo had lined up bankers to work on an IPO that could take place as early as the first half of 2026. However, in a fireside discussion moderated by CNBC at SXSW London, Monzo CEO TS Anil said that an IPO is \"not the thing we're focused on right now\" â it's worth noting though that this was back in June. \"The thing we're focused on is scale the business, continue to grow it, double it again, reach more customers, build more products, continue to drive great economic outcomes on the back of that,\" Anil said at the time. Anil wouldn't comment on where Monzo would list if it were to IPO, but he stressed the firm was \"deeply committed\" to being globally headquartered in London.\n\nStarling Bank\n\nRaman Bhatia, incoming chief executive officer of Starling.

Zed Jameson | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMonzo's rival neobank Starling Bank has reportedly been considering an initial public offering in the U.S. as part of expansion plans there. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Starling had hired Jody Bhagat, former president of global banking at software firm Personetics Technologies, to lead the growth of its Engine technology unit in the U.S. Starling declined to comment when asked by CNBC about its listing plans. Last year, Starling's CEO Raman Bhatia talked up the bank's plans to expand globally via Engine, a software platform that Starling sells to other companies so they can set up their own digital banks. \"I am very bullish about this approach around internationalization of what is the best of Starling â the proprietary tech,\" Bhatia said during a fireside chat at the Money 20/20 conference moderated by CNBC. Starling was last privately valued at Â£2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in a 2022 funding round. However, reports indicate the firm is looking to fetch a valuation of Â£4 billion in an upcoming secondary share sale.\n\nPayhawk\n\nSaravutvanset | Room | Getty Images\n\nThough a lesser known name, Bulgaria-founded fintech firm Payhawk also has IPO ambitions. The spend management platform was valued at $1 billion in 2022 and saw revenue surge 85% year-over-year in 2024 to 23.4 million euros ($27.4 million). \"We're definitely seeing the IPO window open,\" Payhawk CEO and co-founder Hristo Borisov told CNBC in an interview earlier this month. However, he stressed that \"we are looking at more of a five-year horizon there.\" \"If you look at the majority of the IPOs, the majority of those IPOs are companies with $400 million to $500 million-plus ARR [annual recurring revenue],\" Borisov said. \"That's our goal.\"\n\nSome honorary mentions",
