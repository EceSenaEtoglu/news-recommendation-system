Chris Mcgrath | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nGold prices soared to new highs on Wednesday, as the U.S. government entered its first shutdown in almost seven years after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on government funding. Spot gold hit a record of $3,894.63 an ounce while U.S. gold futures for December delivery extended gains to hit a high of $3,922.70. Both pulled back slightly from those highs, with spot gold last at 3,869.89 and gold futures last trading at $3,896.7 per ounce. While the impact of government shutdowns on markets is usually minimal, the timing of this one is significant. Critical U.S. jobs data due to be published on Friday will be delayed, clouding the outlook for the Federal Reserve just weeks ahead of its next meeting. President Donald Trump has also threatened to use the shutdown to cut \"a lot\" of federal employees, who are ordinarily furloughed during a shutdown and brought back to work once it ends. With no clear path toward a deal, it's also unclear how long the shutdown will last. During Trump's first term in office, a 34-day partial shutdown took hold — the longest in history.\n\nAverage market changes over recent shutdowns Shutdown period Full days Type of shutdown S&P 500 (%) net change VIX points net change DXY net change 10-year net change 12/22/18-1/25/19 35 Partial 6 -8 -2 -17 1/20/18-1/22/18 3 Partial 2 4 -2 15 10/1/13-10/17/13 16 Full 3 -1 -2 -14 12/16/95-1/6/96 21 Full -3 4 0 1 11/14/95-11/19/95 5 Full 3 -1 1 -10 10/5/90-10/9/90 3 Partial -5 3 -3 2 Average 1 0 -1 -4\n\nSource: Bank of America\n\nAmid the uncertainty, risk assets lost ground, while gold — typically viewed as a safe haven asset in times of economic or geopolitical turbulence — continued its bumper rally to hit its 39th record high this year.\n\n\"Gold's status as a safe haven is well publicized, but the inexorable rise in the gold price over the last few years has been truly astounding, with the metal hitting fresh highs today,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC in an email on Wednesday. While he noted that the driver behind Wednesday's rally was the U.S. government shutdown, Field argued that it was \"just the straw that broke the camel's back.\" \"Two major ongoing conflicts, political instability in France, newly announced tariffs, all of this is combining to create a very unstable picture for investors,\" he said. \"And when the going gets tough, gold gets a boost.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Spot gold price",

TechCrunch reports: \"Over the last few years, I've turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav -- who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase,\" Ek said in a statement. \"This change simply matches titles to how we already operate. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will focus on the long arc of the company and keep the Board and our co-CEOs deeply connected through my engagement.\"\n \nIn a post on X, Ek also mentioned that Spotify has been profitable for over a year. Ek has served as Spotify's CEO since he founded it in 2006, so this is a big change in leadership for the streaming giant.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Spotify's+Founder+and+CEO+Daniel+Ek+Is+Stepping+Down%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2237218%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2237218%2Fspotifys-founder-and-ceo-daniel-ek-is-stepping-down%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/25/09/30/2237218/spotifys-founder-and-ceo-daniel-ek-is-stepping-down?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "title": "Which Amazon Fire Tablet Is Best for You?",
      "description": "Whether you need a travel-friendly slate or something affordable for the kids, we tested every model to find the right one for every occasion.",
      "content": "WIRED\n\nA faucet for Amazon content: If you subscribe to Amazon’s Prime service, you can consume all the included movies, music, TV, and books, shop for all the items you can get with its free two-day shipping, and browse your free Amazon photo storage. You can do most of the same things from an Android tablet or iPad, but the Fire OS interface is crafted specifically to deliver Amazon goods, with swipeable pages for each type of media Amazon sells.\n\nBuilt “good enough”: Physically, Amazon’s Fire tablets are made of cheap-ish plastic, but they’re designed with enough care that the build quality won’t bother you too much. Wifi reception is excellent, and the front facing cameras have improved considerably in the last couple releases. The Kids Editions are also some of the best-quality tablets for kids, encased in a rugged bumper, and all have microSD slots so you can add extra storage. (We recommend this 128-GB microSD card for $17.) You can make them even more capable by following our guide to installing the Google Play Store on your Fire device. That will give you access to the full range of Android apps. (Note that some apps won't work, but 99 percent of the apps out there for Android will run just fine.)\n\nCheap: Did we mention the price? They all cost $200 or less, save the new Max 11. If you stick to the cheaper models though, they're a great value. You can also get them with Amazon lock-screen ads, which will lower your price by $15.\n\nTIRED\n\nNon-Amazon content is lacking: The greatest strength of these tablets is also their greatest weakness. If you aren’t an Amazon Prime subscriber and don't plan to get your video, audio, or books from Amazon, the Fire tablet line is far less compelling. They do have Alexa, so that could be a plus, but again, that’s tied deeply into Amazon’s content library. You can download third-party apps like Netflix on Amazon’s Appstore, but the selection is far more limited than what's available on Apple's iPad or the Google Play Store on standard Android tablets. To help you get around this limitation, we put together a guide to installing the Google Play Store on your Fire device. Installing the Google Play Store gives you access to the full range of Android apps. In the end, you get a $60 tablet that's capable of 95 percent of what a $330 iPad can do.\n\nOld tech: The tech inside these tablets is old. The processors aren't the fastest, and you'll likely notice small fits of lag and a general lack of power compared to more expensive Android tablets. The touchscreens aren't a responsive or sensitive as more expensive tablets. Since many of the apps for Fire OS are built with weak processing power in mind, you don’t notice it too much. The operating system is also dated (depending on which Fire tablet you're buying), which could hide some of the weaknesses. Amazon’s latest Fire OS is a modified version of Android 11, which came out in 2020. Amazon keeps updating its tablets to some degree, but not nearly as often as it should.\n\nShort warranties: Only the Fire HD 10 comes with a full one-year warranty. Oddly, the smaller devices come with 90-day warranties.\n\nSpecial offers: Over time Amazon's Special Offers ads have gotten more overt and annoying. We recommend you pay the extra $15 to buy a Fire tablet without them.",

      "description": "High court to hear arguments in January on whether Cook will lose her job but says she may stay in her post until then.",
      "content": "High court to hear arguments in January on whether Cook will lose her job but says she may stay in her post until then.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court says it will hear arguments over President Donald Trump’s efforts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her post. The court’s announcement means Cook will stay in the job for now.\n\nThe high court announced the decision on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House has been trying to remove Cook in the first-ever bid by a president to fire a Fed official, an unprecedented challenge to central bank independence.\n\nThe justices declined to immediately decide a Department of Justice request to put on hold a judge’s order temporarily blocking the Republican president from removing Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden, while litigation over the termination continues in a lower court.\n\nThe justices said they would hear the case in January.\n\nIn creating the Fed in 1913, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act, which included provisions to shield the central bank from political interference, such as allowing governors to be removed by a president only “for cause”, although the law does not define the term or establish procedures for removal. The law has never been tested in court.\n\nWashington, DC-based US District Judge Jia Cobb on September 9 ruled that Trump’s claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before taking office, which Cook denies, likely were not sufficient grounds for removal under the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nTrump on August 25 said he was removing Cook from the Fed’s Board of Governors, citing allegations that before joining the central bank in 2022, she falsified records to obtain favourable terms on a mortgage. Her term is set to expire in 2038.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump soon after. Cook has said the claims made by Trump against her did not give the president the legal authority to remove her and were a pretext to fire her for her monetary policy stance.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a 2-1 ruling on September 15 denied the administration’s request to put Cobb’s order on hold.\n\nExpansive view of presidential powers\n\nIn a series of decisions in recent months, the Supreme Court has allowed Trump to remove members of various federal agencies that Congress had established as independent from direct presidential control despite similar job protections for those posts. The decisions suggest that the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, may be ready to jettison a key 1935 precedent that preserved these protections in a case that involved the US Federal Trade Commission.\n\nBut the court has signalled that it could treat the Fed as distinct from other executive branch agencies, noting in May in a case involving Trump’s dismissal of two Democratic members of federal labour boards that the Fed “is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” with a singular historical tradition.\n\nTrump’s bid to fire Cook reflects the expansive view of presidential power he has asserted since returning to office in January. As long as the president identifies a cause for removal, Cook’s sacking is within his “unreviewable discretion”, the Department of Justice said in a September 18 filing to the Supreme Court.\n\n“Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself – and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations,” the filing stated.\n\nCook’s lawyers told the Supreme Court on September 25 that granting Trump’s request, “would eviscerate the Federal Reserve’s longstanding independence, upend financial markets and create a blueprint for future presidents to direct monetary policy based on their political agendas and election calendars”.\n\nA group of 18 former US Federal Reserve officials, Treasury secretaries and other top economic officials who served under presidents from both parties also urged the Supreme Court not to let Trump fire Cook.\n\nThe group included the past three Fed chairs, Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. In a brief to the court, they wrote that allowing this dismissal would threaten the Fed’s independence and erode public confidence in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCook took part in the Fed’s highly anticipated two-day meeting in Washington, DC, in September, at which the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point as policymakers responded to concerns about weakness in the job market. Cook was among those voting in favour of the cut.\n\nPressure on Fed\n\nConcerns about the Fed’s independence from the White House in setting monetary policy could have a ripple effect throughout the global economy.\n\nThe case has ramifications for the Fed’s ability to set interest rates without regard to the wishes of politicians, widely seen as critical to any central bank’s ability to function independently and carry out tasks such as keeping inflation under control.\n\nTrump this year has demanded that the Fed cut rates aggressively, berating Fed Chair Jerome Powell for his stewardship over monetary policy as the central bank focused on fighting inflation. Trump has called Powell a “numbskull,” “incompetent” and a “stubborn moron”.",

      "description": "Alongside its updated Sora 2 AI video generator, OpenAI has launched an iPhone-only social app called Sora that lets users consent to have friends create deepfake-style cameos of them. The invite-only app works a lot like TikTok with short remixable videos but enforces restrictions on public figures and explicit content. The Verge reports: In a briefing with reporters on Monday, employees called it the potential \"ChatGPT moment for video generation.\" The Sora app is currently only available to US and Canada users, with other countries set to follow, and when someone receives access, they also get four additional invites to share with friends. There's no word on when an Android version might be released.\n \nSora users can give their friends -- or, if they're feeling bold, everyone -- permission to create \"cameos\" with their own likeness using the new video model, which is dubbed Sora 2. The person whose likeness is being generated is a \"co-owner\" of that end result, OpenAI employees said, and they can delete it or revoke access to others at any time. Like TikTok, OpenAI's Sora app allows you to interact with other videos and trends using a \"Remix\" feature, but it only allows for the generation of 10-second videos for now.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI's+New+Social+Video+App+Will+Let+You+Deepfake+Your+Friends%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2028215%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2028215%2Fopenais-new-social-video-app-will-let-you-deepfake-your-friends%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/09/30/2028215/openais-new-social-video-app-will-let-you-deepfake-your-friends?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "title": "Chinese Woman Convicted After 'World's Biggest' Bitcoin Seizure",
      "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from the BBC: A Chinese national has been convicted following an international fraud investigation which resulted in what's believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world. The Metropolitan Police says it recovered 61,000 bitcoin worth more than $6.7 billion in current prices. Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. A second person appeared in court on Tuesday to admit to their role in the scheme.\n \nMalaysian national Seng Hok Ling, of Matlock, Derbyshire, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court of entering into a money laundering arrangement on or before April 23, 2024. According to the charge, he had been dealing in cryptocurrency on Qian's behalf, \"knowing or suspecting his actions would facilitate the acquisition or control of criminal property by another.\" Between 2014 and 2017 Qian led a large-scale scam in China which involved cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Met said in a statement.\n \nIt said the 47-year-old's guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web which began when it got a tipoff about the transfer of criminal assets. Qian had been \"evading justice\" for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation. She fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where she attempted to launder the stolen money by buying property, said the Met. \"By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses,\" said Qian's solicitor Roger Sahota, of Berkeley Square Solicitors.\n \n\"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct,\" added deputy chief Crown prosecutor, Robin Weyell. \"This case, involving the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK, illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Chinese+Woman+Convicted+After+'World's+Biggest'+Bitcoin+Seizure%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2035246%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2035246%2Fchinese-woman-convicted-after-worlds-biggest-bitcoin-seizure%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/09/30/2035246/chinese-woman-convicted-after-worlds-biggest-bitcoin-seizure?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "Amazon on Wednesday announced the debut of Amazon Grocery, a new private-label brand that offers a range of grocery items, most of which are priced under $5. The brand offers everything from milk and olive oil to fresh produce, meat, and seafood. Amazon Fresh grocery items will be available online and at Amazon Fresh stores.\n\nThe new label combines the Amazon Fresh and Happy Belly lines into one grocery essentials collection, Amazon says.\n\n“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste — from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials — all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” said Jason Buechel, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Grocery Stores and chief executive officer at Whole Foods Market, in a press release.\n\nThe line will compete with other companies’ private label brands, like Walmart’s Great Value and Target’s Favorite Day.\n\nAmazon says the Amazon Grocery line includes new items such as fresh bakery cinnamon rolls, refrigerated pizza dough, bottled spring water, and more. In the coming months, Amazon will debut new frozen pasta meals, pie fillings, granola, sliced loaf cakes, expanded selections of deli meat, and more.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time that Amazon has rolled out a price-conscious brand, as the company launched its “Amazon Saver” brand last year to offer budget-friendly staples like canned goods and condiments at low prices.\n\nAmazon says that its private-label brands continue to gain momentum, with customers purchasing 15% more private-brand products in 2024 compared to the previous year across Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market, and Amazon Fresh.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "description": "The Global Sumud Flotilla accused an Israeli vessel of steering \"dangerously close\" to one of its boats.",
      "content": "Activists say Gaza flotilla circled by Israeli warship\n\n58 minutes ago Share Save Nathan Williams Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nActivists on a flotilla which is trying to breach Israel's naval blockade and deliver aid to Gaza say they are back on course after a reported confrontation with an Israeli warship in the early hours of Wednesday. The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) says that one of its lead vessels, Alma, was \"aggressively circled\" by an Israeli warship for several minutes, and on board communications were cut off during the incident. The Israeli boat forced Alma's captain to take evasive manoeuvres, activists say, before the same vessel repeated what activists described as \"harassing manoeuvres\" on another boat. Israel has previously said it will not let the flotilla reach its destination.\n\nIt has already blocked two attempts by activists to deliver aid by ship to Gaza, in June and July. The latest Gaza-bound grouping consists of more than 40 boats and 500 people, including Italian politicians and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Thiago Avila, who is on the Alma, said the boat's devices were disabled during the incident, affecting cameras, livestreams and communication systems. Lisi Proenca, who is on Sirius – the second GSF ship involved – said the Israeli vessel circled for about 15 minutes and that their communications were also affected. Activists had earlier said they had prepared for a possible interception after several unidentified vessels, some without lights, approached the flotilla in an area \"where previous flotillas have been attacked and/or intercepted\". The boats sailing in the flotilla had been accompanied by an Italian naval frigate, but Italian officials said that it would stop once the flotilla was 150 nautical miles (278km) from Gaza's shoreline. As of 14:43 GMT (15:43 BST) on Wednesday afternoon, the GSF said its boats were less than 90 nautical miles from Gaza. Previous flotillas have been intercepted by Israeli forces around that point. However, a former Israeli naval intelligence chief told BBC Verify that Israel's military may wait until the vessels are closer to the coast due to the presence of ships from other navies. \"If I was the decision maker, I would engage them inside Israeli territorial waters in order to avoid escalation,\" Eyal Pinko said. \"The Israeli navy has the full intention and the full will not to escalate with friendly navies and those who are on the ships.\" The GSF said it hoped its vessels would arrive on the Gaza shoreline on Thursday morning.\n\nItaly and Greece have called on Israel to ensure the safety and security of the activists and said they are closely monitoring developments. The two countries also called on the activists to accept a compromise proposal to drop the aid in Cyprus and let the Catholic Church distribute it. Their joint statement refers to the US Gaza peace plan, warning against initiatives that could be \"exploited by those who still reject peace\". Earlier, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had urged the activists to stop the journey, saying their actions could serve as a pretext to those who want to destroy the \"hope\" of ending the conflict. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar noted the Italy-Greece statement and called on the flotilla to stop. \"Please transfer any aid you might have peacefully through the Port of Cyprus, [Israel's] Ashkelon Marina, or any other port in the region into Gaza,\" he wrote on X. Trump and Netanyahu agree new Gaza peace plan The GSF said in an earlier statement that it would continue to sail. \"The humanitarian demand to break the blockade cannot be walked back to port,\" it said.\n\nWatch: Greta Thunberg on whether Gaza flotilla is a 'publicity stunt'",

      "description": "Private payrolls saw their biggest decline in 2½ years during September, ADP said.",
      "content": "Private payrolls saw their biggest decline in 2½ years during September, a further sign of labor market weakening that compounds the data blackout accompanying the U.S. government shutdown.\n\nCompanies shed a seasonally adjusted 32,000 jobs during the month, the biggest slide since March 2023, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 45,000.\n\nIn addition to the drop in September, the August payrolls number was revised to a loss of 3,000 from an initially reported increase of 54,000.\n\nThe report comes as the funding impasse in Washington, D.C., has led to the first government closure since late 2018 into early 2019. Failing a deal over the next two days, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls report for September will not be released, nor will the Labor Department put out the weekly jobless claims count on Thursday. The last time the BLS payrolls report was delayed was in 2013.\n\nFederal Reserve officials count on the payrolls releases as they make decisions on interest rates. The Fed next meets Oct. 28-29, meaning there won't be another payrolls report before then.\n\nADP's count, then, takes on added significance as markets widely expect the central bank to cut another quarter point off its key borrowing rate.\n\nJob losses spread across sectors during September, offset by a 33,000 increase in education and health services as schools reopened and health care continued its long streak of hiring.\n\nElsewhere, leisure and hospitality, a key sector for consumer demand, saw a loss of 19,000 as vacation season wound down. The other services category posted a drop of 16,000, while professional and business services was off 13,000, trade, transportation and utilities declined by 7,000, and construction lost 5,000.\n\nOn a broad scale, service providers decreased 28,000 and goods producers shed 3,000. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees lost 40,000, while companies with 500 or more employees added 33,000.\n\n\"Despite the strong economic growth we saw in the second quarter, this month's release further validates\n\nwhat we've been seeing in the labor market, that U.S. employers have been cautious with hiring,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said.\n\nThe U.S. economy did expand 3.8% in the second quarter and is on pace for a 3.9% gain in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow data tracker.\n\nHowever, concerns have increased over the state of the labor market, even with the unemployment rate at a relatively low 4.3%.\n\n\"My baseline outlook doesn't see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks,\" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Tuesday. \"In particular, I see some increased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and unwelcome increase in the unemployment rate.\"\n\nThe consensus view for September was a nonfarm payrolls gain of 51,000 in the BLS report, which unlike ADP includes government jobs.\n\nEven with the slowdown in hiring, wages in September grew 4.5% on an annual basis, little changed from August, ADP said. However, the rate of increase slowed to 6.6% for those changing positions, down half a percentage point from August.\n\nADP said it recalibrated past counts based on BLS benchmark revisions released in September. That resulted in the sharp downward move in the September figure of 43,000. \"The narrative remains the same ... of a slowing in hiring momentum,\" Richardson said on CNBC.\n\nCorrection: ADP recalibrated past counts based on BLS benchmark revisions released in September and that resulted in a downward move in the September figure of 43,000. An earlier version misstated a month.",

If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-streaming-deals\">Best streaming deals</h2> \n<p>True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time.

You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-find-and-cancel-your-unused-subscriptions-130036314.html\">cancel</a> at any time.

So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.</p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=026fe1b5-ea22-49f6-8016-fd8686928f5c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=FuboTV&amp;linkText=Fubo+Pro+for+%2455%2Fmonth+for+the+first+month+%28%2430+off%29%3A&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mdWJvLnR2L3dlbGNvbWUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAyNmZlMWI1LWVhMjItNDlmNi04MDE2LWZkODY4NjkyOGY1YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnViby50di93ZWxjb21lIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXqYkMKAUm8799Kqd7h3b8qXj7L_Ft7q4NAGclsLGpGU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome\"><strong>Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): </strong></a>Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed.

These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> \n<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.</p> \n<p>Also, it's worth noting that anything Disney-related will be getting a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-prices-are-increasing-in-october-yes-again-171830091.html\">price hike</a> soon. As of October 21, 2025, you'll <a href=\"https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price\">pay more</a> for Disney+, Hulu and most associated bundles.

      "content": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\n\nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.\n\nBest streaming deals\n\nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n\nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\n\nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\n\nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYouTube TV (three months) for $219 ($30 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once.\n\nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\n\nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\n\nStudent discounts on streaming services\n\nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\n\nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\n\nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\n\nStreaming bundle discounts\n\nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that anything Disney-related will be getting a price hike soon. As of October 21, 2025, you'll pay more for Disney+, Hulu and most associated bundles. But if you subscribe now, you'll at least pay one month at the old, cheaper rate.\n\nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\n\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\n\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\n\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\n\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\n\nRead more streaming coverage\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",

      "description": "Latin Americans are increasingly flocking to Poland for work, lured by the false promise of secure salaries.",
      "content": "Latin Americans are increasingly flocking to Poland for work, lured by the false promise of secure salaries.\n\nWroclaw, Poland – Rocio Flores, a 44-year-old mother of three, stood trembling in the bathroom of a dilapidated country house in Blaszki, a village in central Poland.\n\nHer breath was shallow as her heart pounded. Minutes earlier, a man from the agency she had been working for had waved a gun at her and five of her Colombian coworkers. It was August 2023.\n\n“In my homeland, Mexico, when a man reaches for his gun, it is because he wants to use it,” she told Al Jazeera. “I thought I was going to die there, I thought my body would be thrown into the cornfields, and I would never see my children again.”\n\nThe dispute began when the agency representative announced that the workers’ shifts at the Plukon chicken processing plant would be extended to 12 hours due to staff shortages. The group had refused and demanded the wages they were owed. A heated argument followed. Then the man reached for his gun.\n\nAl Jazeera has reviewed the video of Flores’s ordeal recorded by one of the workers, and identified the gunman as a Ukrainian. The man was then employed by a contractor company that worked with Jober24, a temporary recruitment agency supplying staff to Plukon.\n\nIn the video, following a physical altercation with one of the Colombian employees, the man in question walks to his car and pulls a gun. While cursing the migrants in Polish, he threatens to call the authorities.\n\n“If the police come, you will get the f*** out [of the country],” he says. Four people among the group were undocumented.\n\nBefore 2022, it was Ukrainians on temporary permits who powered Polish factories, farms and food plants. But since Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukrainian refugees gained greater access to Poland’s labour market and many sought better job opportunities. In search of cheap labour, temporary work agencies began recruiting from elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatin America became the new source. Citizens of Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and other countries from the region could enter the European Union without visas, stay for three months and apply for work permits while already in Poland.\n\nThis changed in June 2025, when Poland introduced a new law. Migrants must now apply for work permits in their home countries. There is also now greater oversight on temporary work agencies, which used to routinely break employment and tax laws. Penalties for violations have also increased.\n\nDespite the changes, however, it is still unclear whether the situation of migrant workers will improve.\n\nFor Colombians, who have faced inflation, unemployment, and Venezuelan migration back home, Poland seems like a chance for a better life.\n\nRecruitment often begins with local agencies that arrange travel. Those recruited are then handed over to Polish partners.\n\n“Often, people are lied to from the beginning,” said Irena Dawid-Olczyk, head of La Strada, an anti-trafficking group. “Some agencies lend them money for the ticket. That debt ties them to exploitative conditions. It’s a form of bonded labour.”\n\nOfficial data shows that Poland issued just more than 4,000 work permits to Colombians in 2022. By 2024, the number had soared to nearly 38,000. But in many cases, agencies do not apply for work permits on migrants’ behalf, leaving people undocumented and at the mercy of employers. It is unclear how many Colombians are living without status in Poland.\n\n“We believe that apart from Latin Americans, migrants from Bangladesh, the Philippines and Central Asia are also at risk,” said Dawid-Olczyk. “But many don’t trust the authorities enough to report abuses.”\n\nAfter the incident, Flores and her colleagues took their video recording to the local police station. According to her, officers located the man, but identified him as a Georgian national and claimed the gun was a toy. They allegedly encouraged the migrants to reconcile with him rather than press charges.\n\nThe police told Al Jazeera that they did not pursue the case because none of the group had filed a formal complaint. In a statement to Al Jazeera, the Plukon plant said that the man with the gun was not directly employed by their company or by Jober24.\n\nEventually, Flores and the others, who work for an outsourcing company, received their payment: 17 zloty ($5) an hour, below the legal minimum wage of 21 zloty ($6) at the time. In their statement, Plukon said that they always paid their workers wages in line with the Polish law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlores had arrived in Poland to find a peaceful life in Europe, far from Mexico’s violence and poverty. Her plan has been for her two daughters and son, who live with her parents, to join her once she settles down.\n\n‘Poland will need migration to sustain its economy’\n\nIn Colombia, TikTok feeds overflow with images of Poland’s medieval castles, dense forests, and cobblestone old towns. Influencers describe the country as a place where Latin Americans can earn well, travel and enjoy a better life.\n\n“People hear, ‘My cousin is making 6,000 zloty [$1,650], and is travelling and has a blonde girlfriend.’ It’s a dream they sell,” said Freddy Abadia, 30, who works with NOMADA, a Wroclaw-based organisation supporting migrants.\n\n“They don’t mention you’ll work 270 hours a month in exhausting jobs, or that many agencies never apply for your work permit.”\n\nAbadia has firsthand experience.\n\nIn 2021, he was recruited by OESAS, a Colombian agency that promised him 4,000 zloty ($1,100) a month for a warehouse job in Poland. Instead, he earned 1,600 ($440) under harsh conditions. He reported the case to La Strada as exploitation.\n\nThe following years were turbulent. He worked other temporary jobs, pursued a master’s degree at Wroclaw University, and even spent time homeless. But his experiences and background as a social worker in Colombia have helped him better understand the systemic issues faced by migrants in Poland.\n\nAt NOMADA, he supports migrant workers and has helped to establish the Latin American Workers’ Union in collaboration with The Workers’ Initiative, a local trade union.\n\nIn August 2023, it was Abadia at the other end of the desperate call for help. Five Colombians and a Mexican woman, Flores, had just fled a chicken plant after being threatened with a gun. They had a car but nowhere to go. Some were undocumented due to their agency’s negligence.\n\nAbadia told them to travel to Wroclaw, where NOMADA offered them a place to stay and help in finding new employment.\n\nThe demand for labour in Poland is growing. According to the Polish Institute of Economy, by 2035, the country’s workforce will shrink by 2.1 million due to demographic decline, an equivalent of 12.6 percent of the current supply.\n\n“Poland will need migration to sustain its economy,” said the institute’s Katarzyna Debkowska. “Between 2022 and 2024 alone, the number of foreigners in the Polish labour market rose by one third.”\n\nThis reliance on migration, without adequate protections, leaves workers in precarious positions.\n\n“Unfortunately, we cannot have the same kind of unions as in Latin America, because we are not citizens,” said Flores. “But we can still inform people, warn them about the risks, and share the truth with those who consider coming here.”\n\nTwo years after her arrival, Flores is in a better place. She has a stable job and, together with NOMADA, she has penned a migrant “survival guide” for Poland, with practical advice and information about employment rights.",

      "content": "Longtime investor Leon Cooperman believes we are in the late innings of a bull market where bubbles can form and risks rise, a stage of the cycle that Warren Buffett had warned about.\n\nThe chair and CEO of the Omega Family Office read a quote from the \"Oracle of Omaha\" on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" Wednesday, which he said fits neatly with what he's seeing right now.\n\n\"Once a bull market gets under way, and once you reach the point where everybody has made money no matter what system he or she followed, a crowd is attracted into the game that is responding not to interest rates and profits but simply to the fact that it seems a mistake to be out of stocks,\" Buffett said in 1999, according to a Fortune Magazine article.\n\nBuffett believes bull markets often end not only when valuations are stretched, but also when there is irrational exuberance and when the rally is fueled by momentum.\n\n\"It's what's going on now,\" Cooperman said, adding that investors' mood is very similar and valuation on artificial intelligence companies is \"ridiculously high.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 40% since its April lows, returning to all-time highs. The rally has been led by mega-cap tech giants, which have invested billions in artificial intelligence and are being valued richly on the potential of this emerging era.",

      "description": "Amazon is replacing Android on new Fire TV hardware with its own Vega OS, debuting on the Fire TV Stick 4K Select. While major streaming apps are supported, sideloading is gone \"because, well, this isn't Android anymore,\" notes 9to5Google. The company says \"only apps from the Amazon Appstore are available for download.\" From the report: The company hasn't fully detailed all of the ins and outs of Vega, but Amazon hints that this is a move in the interest of performance. In a post, Amazon touches on Vega being \"remarkably fast\" despite the low-end hardware of its new Fire TV Stick 4K Select: \"Our newest Fire TV Stick, the 4K Select, helps you maximize every pixel of your 4K TVs at an incredible value. It delivers vibrant 4K picture quality with HDR10+ support and apps that launch remarkably fast. The performance comes from our new operating system, Vega, which is responsive and highly efficient. Everything you need is right in the box -- it works with your favorite streaming services, and will soon support Xbox Gaming, Luna, and Alexa+.\"\n \nAs pointed out by AFTVNews, the Fire TV 4K Select offers a mere 1GB of RAM, which is half as much as prior generations. So, in a way, that does speak to how lightweight this new platform is. But the bigger question is around apps. Amazon says that \"your favorite streaming services\" still work with Vega, and that Xbox, Luna, and Alexa+ will be coming \"soon\" (though they're already supported on existing Android-based Fire TV devices).<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Amazon+Launches+Vegas+OS%2C+Its+Android+Replacement+For+Fire+TV+With+No+Sideloading%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2225237%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F30%2F2225237%2Famazon-launches-vegas-os-its-android-replacement-for-fire-tv-with-no-sideloading%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/09/30/2225237/amazon-launches-vegas-os-its-android-replacement-for-fire-tv-with-no-sideloading?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "Eazewell helps families navigate end-of-life planning, from coordinating a funeral to cancelling someone's mail, with the help of AI.",
      "content": "When Donnell Beverly Jr. decided to launch end-of-life planning startup Eazewell after the loss of both of his parents, he knew exactly who to call to help launch the business: longtime friend, and nine-time NBA All Star, Russell Westbrook.\n\n“The main thesis with Russ across every business that he touches is how do we impact people?” Beverly Jr. [pictured above] told TechCrunch. “He’s been very vocal about that throughout his career. I always say we really took personal pain and then created a platform to really help people.”\n\nWestbrook was in. Former four-time NBA All Star Kemba Walker also joined and the trio launched Eazewell.\n\nEazewell is an AI-driven platform that helps families navigate and automate the administrative aspects of end-of-life and funeral planning. The startup’s AI agent gives people a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week resource and helps users with everything from finding and booking a funeral home to cancelling credit card accounts for a deceased person.\n\nThe company partners with different service providers, like hospice care, funeral homes, and various insurance companies, which allows the platform to be free to use with the option of paying for more premium features.\n\n“I had an opportunity to be able to be close with his family and go through the process with [Beverly Jr.],” Westbrook told TechCrunch. “He’s done an amazing job of idealizing this idea and bringing it to life. I’m excited to kind of be partner with him alongside him on this.”\n\nBeverly Jr. said he got the idea for Eazewell after losing both of his parents in a short period of time. Navigating what came after their deaths made him realize how large of a burden the end-of-life process can be — and how fragmented the market of these services is.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The company said it has been able to help more than 100,000 families since its launched its platform earlier this year.\n\nNow, Eazewell is rolling out a new enterprise platform for hospice companies, senior living facilities and life insurers. This allows companies to fold Eazewell’s automated features into their own management software.\n\nIn the future, Eazwell hopes to help people manage a loved one’s digital assets after they pass, a task that has become a bigger undertaking as people’s lives are increasingly online.\n\n“The average person has anywhere between 70 and 100 digital accounts that are active at any time,” Beverly Jr. said. “Your family is inheriting all those digital accounts and those digital assets as well. And that’s not typical. We’re stepping into a new kind of realm within that. When we look at the whole landscape, we see a grand opportunity to not only help people but just make it a lot more seamless.”\n\nFor Westbrook, Eazewell offers the perfect opportunity to go into business with a decades-long friend while also being able to use his platform to amplify a business that can help people — especially those from underserved and under-resourced communities — navigate this painful and costly experience.\n\n“Anytime I put my name on anything, I try to find ways to open doors, build trust, find ways to play a big role in it and be present because I think that’s important,” Westbrook said. “And this isn’t about me or being super technical by any means, but it’s more importantly about families finding ways to be able to help them through a loss. And for me, using my platform to be able to do that is a no-brainer.”",

      "description": "US deportee says Ghanaian officers secretly moved him and others to Togo and left them there without documents.",
      "content": "Deported from the US to Ghana then 'dumped' at the border: Nigerian man speaks out\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Thomas Naadi BBC Africa, Accra Share Save\n\nPhotothek via Getty Images Togo's capital city, Lomé, is near the Ghanaian border\n\nA Nigerian man deported from the US to Ghana has told the BBC that he is now stuck in a hotel in Togo, after he and five others were secretly transferred to the neighbouring country by Ghanaian officers. The man said they were informed they would be moved from a military camp to better accommodation, but were then \"dumped\" in Togo. The BBC has approached Ghana's government for comment. The US government deported the Nigerian man - along with other West African nationals - as part of its crackdown on immigration. Ghana's Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa previously said the government had accepted the deportees in the spirit of \"pan-African empathy\".\n\nThe Nigerian, who has requested anonymity for safety reasons, alleged that Ghanaian officers took him and the five other deportees into Togo through a back route. He further claimed that this was done after bribing local police, and without informing Togolese authorities of their entry. \"They did not take us through the main border, they took us through the back door. They paid the police there and dropped us in Togo,\" he said. The Togolese authorities have not commented on the alleged presence of the deportees on their territory. Four of the group - three Nigerians and a Liberian - then checked into a hotel in Lomé, the Togolese capital, which lies just across the border from where they were abandoned. With no documents of their own, he said they relied on the hotel staff to receive money from relatives abroad to cover their bills. \"We're struggling to survive in Togo without any documentation,\" he said. \"None of us has family in Togo. We're just stuck in a hotel,\" he added. \"Right now, we're just trying to survive until our lawyers can help us with this situation.\" He said that while in Ghana they had been asking for better living conditions since the environment at the military camp where they were placed was \"deplorable\". \"Life there was really hard, so we asked for a better place, better medication, better healthcare and better water,\" the Nigerian told the BBC. He said that days later, immigration officials arrived at the camp, saying they were taking six of them to a hotel for more comfort, but they ended up across the border in Togo. \"When we arrived, we asked what we were doing at the border, and they told us they wanted us to sign some paperwork so they could take us to a hotel, but we didn't sign anything,\" he added.\n\nThe Nigerian told the BBC that the language barrier in Togo made it difficult to communicate. Togo's official language is French, while he spoke English. He also said that his deportation had affected his family in the US. \"I have a house in the US where my kids live. How am I supposed to pay the mortgage? I don't know how they'll manage while I'm gone. My kids can't see me, and it's just so stressful,\" he lamented. He said he was a member of the Yoruba Self-Determination Movement, an activist organisation advocating for a breakaway state in south-west Nigeria for the Yoruba ethnic group. Although the movement is not banned, it has been in the crosshairs of the Nigerian government, with 27 people arrested last year for being involved in its campaign. Because of his affiliation with the group, the man told the BBC he fears that returning to Nigeria could lead to his arrest and torture. The Nigerian deportee said he was under a US court-ordered protection that should have shielded him from deportation from the US. The US has not given the reason for his deportation. The Nigerian was part of a group of West Africans deported to Ghana last month, which also included nationals of Togo, Liberia and The Gambia. They had previously been held in a US detention facility before being flown out on a US military plane in shackles, their lawyers said. The US government's \"third-country deportation\" policy has faced criticism, with several countries pushing back against the strategy, including Nigeria. The deal for Ghana to take in nationals from various West African countries was announced by President John Mahama three weeks ago. He said he had been approached by the US to accept the deportees, and had agreed because there was free movement of people in West Africa. Foreign Minister Ablakwa has since said Ghana received no financial reward for accepting the deportees. Opposition MPs have demanded an immediate suspension of the deportation agreement until it is ratified by parliament, but the government has said it plans to accept another 40 deportees. Lawyers for the deportees have started legal action against both the US and Ghanaian governments, saying their rights were violated.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

      "content": "Stablecoins are making major strides in mainstream adoption.\n\nThe blockbuster IPO of USDC issuer Circle and the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill becoming law in the U.S. in July boosted excitement for cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar.\n\nNow, small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. are exploring how the technology could cut down on one their biggest expenses: payment processing fees.\n\nMerchant processing fees totaled a record $187.2 billion in 2024, according to a study from Nilson Report. Those fees are collected from credit card swipes and mobile phone payments.\n\n\"If credit card transaction fees were an employee in my business, they would be by far the highest-paid employee,\" said Wade Preston, co-founder of Prevail Coffee Roasters.\n\nPrevail has four locations between Alabama and Georgia, and it's testing a new payment app that allows customers to pay with stablecoins at the register.\n\nThe goal is to cut down on merchant processing fees and provide near-instantaneous receipt of payment.\n\n\"There's tremendous potential in stablecoins. It should disrupt, to some extent, the traditional payment space we have today with credit and debit cards,\" said Doug Kantor, general counsel for the National Association of Convenience Stores. \"It has the promise of faster, cheaper, more efficient and frankly, more convenient transactions for consumers and businesses.\"\n\nWatch the video above to learn how stablecoins could reshape how customers shop at their favorite U.S. businesses.",
