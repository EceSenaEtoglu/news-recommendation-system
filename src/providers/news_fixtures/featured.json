      "title": "Big Oil forced to confront some tough choices as 'monster profits' fade into memory",
      "description": "A weaker crude price environment is expected to put the industry’s generous shareholder payouts at serious risk over the coming months.",

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nEnergy supermajors are being forced to confront some tough choices in a weaker crude price environment, with generous shareholder payouts expected to come under serious pressure over the coming months. U.S. and European oil majors, including Exxon Mobil , Chevron , Shell and BP , have moved to cut jobs and reduce costs of late, as they look to tighten their belts amid an industry downturn. It reflects a stark change in mood from just a few years ago. In 2022, the West's five biggest oil companies raked in combined profits of nearly $200 billion when fossil fuel prices soared following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Flush with cash, the likes of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies sought to use what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres described as their \"monster profits\" to reward shareholders with higher dividends and share buybacks. Indeed, the amount of cash returns as a percentage of cash flow from operations (CFFO) has climbed to as much as 50% for several energy companies in recent quarters, according to Maurizio Carulli, global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\n\nIt's better to cut buybacks than dividends: For investors, buybacks are gravy, but dividends are the meat. Clark Williams-Derry Energy finance analyst at IEEFA\n\nIn today's environment of weaker crude prices, however, Carulli said this policy risks taking on new levels of debt beyond what could be considered a \"healthy\" balance sheet. BP and, more recently, TotalEnergies have announced plans to take steps to reduce shareholder returns. BP in April lowered its share buyback to $750 million, down from $1.75 billion in the prior quarter, after reporting first-quarter profit which fell short of market expectations. TotalEnergies, for its part, said late last month that it had decided to adjust the pace of its share buybacks \"in order to face economic and geopolitical uncertainties and to retain room to maneuver.\" Quilter Cheviot's Carulli described these moves as a \"sensible change in direction,\" noting that other oil majors will likely follow suit. Thomas Watters, managing director and sector lead for oil and gas at S&P Global Ratings, echoed this sentiment.\n\nOil refinery at sunrise: an aerial view of industrial power and energy production. Chunyip Wong | E+ | Getty Images\n\n\"Oil companies are under pressure as crude prices soften, with the potential for prices to fall into the $50 range next year as OPEC continues to release surplus capacity and global inventories build,\" Watters told CNBC by email. \"Faced with the challenge of sustaining these returns in a lower-price environment, many will look to reduce costs and capital spending where they can,\" he added.\n\nDividend cuts 'would send shivers through Wall Street'\n\nClark Williams-Derry, energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a non-profit organization, said trimming the share buybacks is likely Big Oil's easiest option. \"Over the past few years, oil companies have used buybacks to return cash to investors and prop up share prices. And it's better to cut buybacks than dividends: For investors, buybacks are gravy, but dividends are the meat,\" Williams-Derry told CNBC by email. \"A cut in a dividend would send shivers through Wall Street,\" Williams-Derry said. Saudi Arabia's state oil producer Saudi Aramco did just that earlier in the year, slashing the world's biggest dividend amid an uncertain outlook for oil prices.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Brent crude futures year-to-date.\n\nIEEFA's Williams-Derry linked the move to a steady weakening of the Saudi Aramco's share price through most of this year, noting that other private oil majors will want to avoid the same fate. Ultimately, Williams-Derry said oil majors likely have three questions to consider now that the Ukraine boom in oil prices has faded. \"Do they keep taking on new debt to fund their shareholder payouts? Do they slash buybacks, eliminating one of the major factors propping up share prices? Or do they cut back on drilling, signaling weaker production in the future?\" Williams-Derry said. \"There are risks to each choice, and no matter what they choose they're bound to make some investors unhappy,\" he added.\n\nBig Oil outlook\n\nFor some, Big Oil's current state of play is not nearly as bad as it might have been. \"It perhaps hasn't been as gloomy as people expected earlier in the year, because you've had this narrative, really since the announcement of Trump's tariffs back in April, that the oil market was meant to go into a glut and a period of oversupply later in the year,\" Peter Low, co-head of energy research at Rothschild & Co Redburn, told CNBC by video call. \"What's actually surprised people is how resilient oil prices have been because they have stayed in that $65 to $70 a barrel range, more or less,\" he added.",

      "description": "California's Privacy Protection Agency \"issued a record fine earlier this month to Tractor Supply,\" according to an EFF Deeplinks blog post &mdash; for \"apparently ducking its responsibilities under the California Consumer Privacy Act.\"\n\n\nUnder that law, companies are required to respect California customers' and job applicants' rights to know, delete, and correct information that businesses collect about them, and to opt-out of some types of sharing and use. The law also requires companies to give notice of these rights, along with other information, to customers, job applicants, and others. The CPPA said that Tractor Supply failed several of these requirements. This is the first time the agency has enforced this data privacy law to protect job applicants... \n\nTractor Supply, which has 2,500 stores in 49 states, will pay for their actions to the tune of $1,350,000 &mdash; the largest fine the agency has issued to date. Specifically, the agency said, Tractor Supply violated the law by: \n\n- Failing to maintain a privacy policy that notified consumers of their rights; \n- Failing to notify California job applicants of their privacy rights and how to exercise them; \n- Failing to provide consumers with an effective mechanism to opt-out of the selling and sharing of their personal information, including through opt-out preference signals such as Global Privacy Control; and \n- Disclosing personal information to other companies without entering into contracts that contain privacy protections. \n\nIn addition to the fine, the company also must take an inventory of its digital properties and tracking technologies and will have to certify its compliance with the California privacy law for the next four years. \nThe agency's web site says it \"continues to actively enforce California's cutting-edge privacy laws.\" It's recently issued decisions (and fines) against American Honda Motor Company and clothing retailer Todd Snyder. Other recent actions include:\n\n Securing a settlement agreement requiring data broker Background Alert &mdash; which promoted its ability to dig up \"scary\" amounts of information about people &mdash; to shut down or pay a steep fine.\n Launching the bipartisan Consortium of Privacy Regulators to collaborate with states across the country to implement and enforce privacy laws nationwide.\n Partnering with the data protection authorities in Korea, France, and the United Kingdom to share information and advance privacy protections for Californians.\nThe agency has secured more than half a dozen successful enforcement actions against unregistered data brokers following an investigative sweep launched late last year to assess compliance with the Delete Act.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=California+'Privacy+Protection+Agency'+Targets+Tractor+Supply's+Tricky+Tracking%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F10%2F11%2F0544209%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F10%2F11%2F0544209%2Fcalifornia-privacy-protection-agency-targets-tractor-supplys-tricky-tracking%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0544209/california-privacy-protection-agency-targets-tractor-supplys-tricky-tracking?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "title": "Should You Cancel Xbox Game Pass? Everything to Know on the Price Hikes and New Features",
      "description": "Xbox users in the US face price increases up to 50 percent on their monthly gaming subscription, making it a great time to check if you’re on the right tier or if you even need to subscribe at all.",
      "content": "Like it or loathe it, we live in a subscription economy. Music, movies, meal boxes, and more are no longer things you buy once. They’re a constant draw on your wallet. Gaming is no exception, and while every major player in the sector has some form of sub for players—from PlayStation Plus and Nintendo Switch Online for consoles to Apple Arcade on phones—none of them offered quite as much for a modest monthly fee as Xbox Game Pass.\n\nDepending on the subscription tier, the service gave players access to a significant library of titles and was available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via cloud gaming. While most of its competitors focused on back-catalog titles for their gaming subscriptions, Game Pass stood apart by including major first-party titles on their day of release for subscribers to its Ultimate tier.\n\nMicrosoft long claimed it was “the best deal in gaming,” and with new releases costing upwards of $70 per title versus a $19.99 monthly price tag on Game Pass Ultimate, it was hard to argue. Recent changes to the service, however—including some hefty price rises—have upset users in a big way, sending so many people rushing to cancel their subscriptions that the membership site crashed.\n\nWhat’s Happened?\n\nOn October 1, Microsoft revamped the entire structure of Game Pass. Previously, and following an earlier rejig in September 2024, players had essentially four options—Game Pass for PC, Game Pass Core, Game Pass Standard, and Game Pass Ultimate. Going forward, Core is replaced with Essential, and Standard is replaced with Premium, while Ultimate retains its name. All tiers are now accessible on PC, although a dedicated PC-only plan remains available.\n\nIt’s not the rebrand that’s had people canceling, though—it’s the hefty price hikes that have come with the upper tiers. While Essential keeps the almost totemic $9.99-per-month pricing of Core, Premium jumps to $14.99 from Standard’s $11.99 (a 25 percent increase), and the PC-only offering goes from $11.99 to $16.49 (a 38 percent increase). It’s Game Pass Ultimate that’s proven the most contentious, leaping from $19.99 to $29.99. Price increases on subscription services routinely boil the frog and creep up in price slowly—just look at what you used to pay for Netflix—but a massive 50 percent spike overnight, the equivalent of $120 more a year, has caught many off guard.\n\nIt doesn't help that it follows two price hikes on Xbox consoles themselves in the span of less than a year, at least in the US. In May 2025, the 512-GB Xbox Series S went from $299.99 to $379.99, the 1-TB Xbox Series X from $499.99 to $599.99, and the 2-TB Series X from $599.99 to $729.99. These prices rose globally, with prices reflected in each territory. But then, in September, prices rose again for buyers in America, taking those same models to $399.99, $649.99, and $799.99, respectively. Microsoft cited the increases being “due to changes in the macroeconomic environment”—read: tariffs—but the combined effect on pricing across the whole Xbox ecosystem really challenges that “best deal in gaming” idea.",

      "content": "China accuses US of 'double standards' over tariff threat\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Stephen McDonell China correspondent and Nick Edser business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said. A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war. On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month. But on Sunday, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\"\n\n\"Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April. On Monday, the Shenzhen Composite Index in mainland China closed 0.74% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.5%. The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.",

      "description": "The Register reports:\nOver the past two years, the open source curl project has been flooded with bogus bug reports generated by AI models. The deluge prompted project maintainer Daniel Stenberg to publish several blog posts about the issue in an effort to convince bug bounty hunters to show some restraint and not waste contributors' time with invalid issues. Shoddy AI-generated bug reports have been a problem not just for curl, but also for the Python community, Open Collective, and the Mesa Project. \nIt turns out the problem is people rather than technology. Last month, the curl project received dozens of potential issues from Joshua Rogers, a security researcher based in Poland. Rogers identified assorted bugs and vulnerabilities with the help of various AI scanning tools. And his reports were not only valid but appreciated. Stenberg in a Mastodon post last month remarked, \"Actually truly awesome findings.\" In his mailing list update last week, Stenberg said, \"most of them were tiny mistakes and nits in ordinary static code analyzer style, but they were still mistakes that we are better off having addressed. Several of the found issues were quite impressive findings....\" \n\nStenberg told The Register that about 50 bugfixes based on Rogers' reports have been merged. \"In my view, this list of issues achieved with the help of AI tooling shows that AI can be used for good,\" he said in an email. \"Powerful tools in the hand of a clever human is certainly a good combination. It always was...!\" Rogers wrote up a summary of the AI vulnerability scanning tools he tested. He concluded that these tools &mdash; Almanax, Corgea, ZeroPath, Gecko, and Amplify &mdash; are capable of finding real vulnerabilities in complex code. \n\nThe Register's conclusion? AI tools \"when applied with human intelligence by someone with meaningful domain experience, can be quite helpful.\" \n\njantangring (Slashdot reader #79,804) has published an article on Stenberg's new position, including recently published comments from Stenberg that \"It really looks like these new tools are finding problems that none of the old, established tools detect.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=AI+Slop%3F+Not+This+Time.+AI+Tools+Found+50+Real+Bugs+In+cURL+%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F10%2F12%2F0619247%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F10%2F12%2F0619247%2Fai-slop-not-this-time-ai-tools-found-50-real-bugs-in-curl%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/10/12/0619247/ai-slop-not-this-time-ai-tools-found-50-real-bugs-in-curl?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "Zion Church, founded by pastor Jin Mingri in 2007, is one of China's largest underground church networks.",
      "content": "US calls for China to release 30 leaders of influential underground church\n\nJin Mingri, who founded the influential Zion Church is 2007, is among those detained\n\nChristians have long been pressured to join only state-sanctioned churches that are led by government-approved pastors and toe the party line.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party promotes atheism and tightly controls religion - still, some Christian groups are calling this the most extensive crackdown against the faith in decades.\n\nThe list includes several pastors and Zion Church founder Jin Mingri who was arrested in the early hours of Saturday after 10 officers searched his home, US-based non-profit ChinaAid said.\n\nThe US has called for the release of 30 leaders of one of China's largest underground church network who were reportedly detained over the weekend in overnight raids in various cities.\n\nIt is unclear if the detainees have been formally charged.\n\n\"Such systematic persecution is not only an affront to the Church of God but also a public challenge to the international community,\" Zion Church said in a statement.\n\nUrging China to release the church leaders, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Sunday that \"this crackdown further demonstrates how the CCP exercises hostility towards Christians who reject Party interference in their faith and choose to worship at unregistered house churches\".\n\nFormer US vice-president Mike Pence and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo have also released statements on X condemning the arrests.\n\nWhen asked about the arrests at a press conference, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said he was not aware of the case.\n\nHe added: \"The Chinese government governs religious affairs in accordance with the law, and protects the religious freedom of citizens and normal religious activities. We firmly oppose the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues.\"\n\nThis could be yet another source of friction in the US-China relationship with trade tensions once again ramping up between the world's two biggest economies over tariffs and export controls.\n\nAlready, there is doubt over whether a summit between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, which was expected to happen in South Korea later this month, will proceed.\n\nUnder Xi, Beijing has cracked down even more on religious freedom, especially against Christians and Muslims.\n\nAt a national conference on religion in 2016, he called on the party to \"guide those [who are] religious to love their country, protect the unification of their motherland and serve the overall interests of the Chinese nation\".\n\nDespite this, there has been a growing movement of unregistered house churches in China.\n\nAmong them is Zion Church, which Mr Jin started in 2007 with just 20 people. Its network now includes some 10,000 people in 40 cities across the country, making it one of the largest underground churches in China.\n\nIn September 2018, the Party officially banned the church after it resisted government pressure to install security cameras at its property in Beijing. Mr Jin and several church leaders were detained briefly.\n\nMany of its branch congregations across the country have since been investigated and shut down. Mr Jin's family relocated to the US for safety, while he remained in China to pastor his flock. Authorities have barred him from leaving the country.\n\nStill the church continued to gather in small groups and shared its sermons online.\n\nChinaAid has called this roundup of Christian leaders - which involved police across several cities - unprecedented, and the \"most extensive and coordinated wave of persecution\" against Christians in over four decades.\n\n\"This new nationwide campaign echoes the darkest days of the 1980s, when urban churches first re-emerged from the Cultural Revolution,\" said ChinaAid's founder Bob Fu, referring to a period of mass purges in the 1960s and 1970s which triggered violence and huge upheaval across China.\n\nIn a letter seeking prayers, Mr Jin's wife Liu Chunli wrote that her heart is \"filled with a mix of shock, grief, sorrow, worry, and righteous anger\".\n\nMr Jin \"simply [did] what any faithful pastor would do... He is innocent!\" she wrote, adding that her family's hopes for a reunion after being separated for more than seven years have been dashed yet again.\n\nSeveral house churches in China have also issued statements calling for the release of those detained.\n\nSean Long, a Zion Church pastor based in the US, said Mr Jin had been prepared for a crackdown of this scale.\n\nIn a Zoom call weeks ago between the two pastors, Mr Long had asked what would happen if Mr Jin was put in prison and all the church's leaders detained.\n\nMr Jin had replied: \"Hallelujah! For a new wave of revival will follow then!\"",

      "description": "Tensions between Beijing and Washington have flared again in recent days as both sides traded barbs and ramped up respective restrictions.",
      "content": "A cargo ship carries foreign trade containers on the Jiaozhou Bay waterway in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, on August 5, 2025. Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nChina's exports climbed at the fastest pace in six months in September, while imports logged their strongest gain in more than a year, even as a trade deal with the U.S. remains elusive. Exports grew 8.3% in September in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, China's customs data showed Monday, beating Reuters-polled economists' estimates for a 7.1% rise and rebounding from August's six-month low. Imports jumped 7.4% last month from a year ago, sharply beating Reuters' estimates for a 1.5% growth, marking the strongest level since April 2024, according to LSEG data. China's exports to the U.S. fell 27% in September, while imports declined 16% from a year earlier. Beijing's imports from the U.S. have dropped by double digits year on year every month since April. Beijing's trade surplus with the U.S. in the first nine months scaled back to $208.6 billion, according to the official data, compared to $25.8 billion during the same period last year. The double-digit declines in U.S.-bound shipments were largely offset by sharp increases in exports to other markets. Exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union and Africa surged 15.6%, 10.4% and 56.4%, respectively. Tensions between Beijing and Washington have flared again in recent days as both sides traded barbs and ramped up respective restrictions, threatening to erode progress made after several rounds of bilateral trade talks this year.\n\nTrade tensions flare up\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 100% levy on Chinese exports and tighter export controls on critical software. Beijing, meanwhile, expanded restrictions on rare earth exports — though some don't take effect until November — and broadened its \"unreliable entities\" blacklist to include chip consulting firm TechInsights. Authorities have also opened a fresh antitrust probe into U.S. semiconductor manufacturing giant Qualcomm . The additional tariff on U.S. imports from China, if stacked on the current average tariff of around 55%, could take the total levies to above 150%, effectively causing a trade embargo, said Gabriel Wildau, managing director at political risks advisory Teneo. \"China would likely respond tit-for-tat, and bilateral trade would slow to a trickle,\" Wildau added. Both sides have threatened to impose charges on each other's ships for docking at their own ports, set to take effect the same day on Oct. 14. Chinese levies will start at 400 yuan ($56) per ton, matching that imposed by Washington. The U.S. makes up just 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared with 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. China Customs spokesperson Lyu Daliang said at a news conference Monday that Beijing hopes the U.S. will realize that it is taking the wrong approach by raising port fees and urged Washington to return to dialogue and negotiation. Lyu added that new tariffs introduced by several countries this year have hurt businesses and disrupted the global economy, saying China remains committed to supporting multilateral trade. The reluctance of China — the world's largest importer of soybeans — to resume purchases of America's crops further dimmed hopes for a trade accord. Trump said earlier this month that he hoped to press the Chinese president at their planned meeting in late October to end the months-long moratorium on U.S. soybean purchases. Chinese soybean imports climbed 13% in September from a year earlier, according to the official data, although details on sources of these crops were not immediately available. China's exports of rare earths fell 30% from the previous month to 4,000 tons in September. Earlier this month, Beijing tightened its grip on the critical minerals by adding five new elements to its control list and increasing scrutiny for foreign firms seeking access to the materials. If fully enforced, the rules could have a major impact as they require global chip companies such as Nvidia, TSMC and Intel to obtain licenses from Chinese regulators to sell chips anywhere in the world, said Wildau.\n\nTrump-Xi meeting hangs in balance\n\nFocus now turns to a Xi-Trump meeting at the end of the month, where the two sides can dial back the escalation, said Allan von Mehren, China economist at Danske Bank, who put the odds of such an outcome at more than 50%. China's commerce ministry said earlier Sunday that the U.S. should back off its tariff threats and urged further talks to resolve outstanding trade issues. \"Threatening with high tariffs at every turn is not the right way to get along with China,\" the Commerce Ministry said. \"If the US persists in its own course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\" Customs vice minister Wang Jun said at the Monday press conference that stabilizing trade in the fourth quarter will be challenging because of the complex external environment and the high base effect of last year. China will likely be compelled to deepen ties with other markets, said Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Bank, potentially offering greater access to its trading partners. \"Nations wanting to engage with China are likely to find a more amenable export environment in the coming years,\" he added.\n\nImports rebound",

      "content": "Mali imposes $10,000 visa bond on US visitors in tit-for-tat move\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Martin Mwangi BBC Monitoring Share Save\n\nTribune News Service via Getty Images The US has taken a tough line on immigration since President Donald Trump took office in January\n\nMali has announced that US nationals visiting the West African country will be required to post a bond of up to $10,000 (£7,500) for business and tourist visas, in response to a similar requirement the Trump administration has imposed on its citizens. The US embassy in Mali said on Friday the fee had been introduced to reinforce Washington's \"commitment to protecting America's borders and safeguarding US national security\". Mali's foreign ministry said on Sunday the bond had been imposed unilaterally, and it had decided to \"establish an identical visa programme\" for US citizens. The visa policy shift comes despite moves to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\nIn July, US officials visited Mali to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and economic partnerships, including potential access to Mali's gold and lithium reserves. Relations deteriorated after a coup in Mali in 2021 led to Gen Assimi Goïta sweeping to power. He pivoted the West African state towards Russia in a bid to stem a growing insurgency by jihadists. He expelled French troops, and brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, which is under Moscow's defence ministry. They have since been replaced by Africa Corps. Last week, Burkina Faso's military government refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation. Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries. The Trump administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of its crackdown on immigration.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

      "title": "Trump might give Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine — could they be a game-changer in the war?",
      "description": "President Trump has said he might give Ukraine long-range cruise missiles called Tomahawks. Russia said that would be seen as a \"serious escalation\" in the war.",
      "content": "The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG 52) launches a Tomahawk cruise missile to support Joint Task Force Odyssey Dawn. Jonathan Sunderman | USNAVY | Corbis | Getty Images\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that he's considering sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide \"a new step of aggression\" in its war with Russia. As the president travelled on Air Force One to the Middle East on Monday, first to Israel and then Egypt for talks on finalizing a peace deal for Gaza, when asked if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied \"we'll see... I may.\" He also signaled he could use the supply of Tomahawks to pressure Russia to end the war, telling reporters: \"I might say 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks.' \"The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that,\" he said, according to comments reported by Sky News.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds an umbrella before boarding Air Force One, as he departs for Israel, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Oct. 12, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters\n\nTrump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have discussed the potential provision on Tomahawk missiles, which would allow Ukraine to launch robust counter-attacks against Russia. But the U.S. president is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding whether he will actually send the missiles to Ukraine. He said Monday that he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the matter. No such call has been scheduled, as yet, according to comments from the Kremlin on Monday. Russia has warned that any provision of long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv would be seen as a \"serious escalation.\"\n\nWhat are Tomahawks?\n\nTomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles and can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away, even in heavily defended airspace, according to U.S. manufacturer Raytheon . Designed for striking high value or heavily defended land targets, Tomahawks can be fired from ground launchers but are typically launched from ships or submarines, and can be armed with conventional or nuclear warheads. The missiles don't come cheap, with a reported average cost of $1.3 million each.\n\nSailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS Preble conduct an operational tomahawk missile launch while underway in a training area off the coast of California. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Woody Paschall\n\nFirst developed in the 1970s, they are used by the U.S. military and have been purchased — or with agreements to purchase — by a number of allies, including the U.K., Japan, Australia and the Netherlands. The latest version, called the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk, or TACTOM, has a data link that allows it to switch targets while in flight. It can loiter for hours and change course instantly on command. Raytheon notes that U.S. and Allied militaries have flight tested the GPS-enabled Tomahawk over 550 times and used it in an operational environment more than 2,350 times. Its most recent use came in 2024, when the U.S. and British navies launched Tomahawk missiles at Houthi rebel sites in Yemen.\n\nRussian reaction\n\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Moscow's leadership was waiting to see the specifics of any deal to supply Tomahawks, but was scathing about the prospect. \"This would be a serious escalation which, however, wouldn't change the situation for the Kyiv regime on the front lines. But it's important to understand that, leaving aside the details, we're talking about nuclear capable missiles. Therefore, this is truly a serious escalation.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov during a summit of leaders of nations, which are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in Moscow, Russia October 8, 2024. Sergei Ilnitsky | Via Reuters\n\nOn Monday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that any Tomahawk supply could end badly for everyone, including Trump. He noted that it's impossible to distinguish between Tomahawk missiles carrying nuclear warheads and conventional ones after they are launched. \"How should Russia respond? Exactly!\" Medvedev said on Telegram, in comments translated by Reuters, seeming to hint that Moscow's response would be a nuclear one. Asked on Monday about Trump's comments that he would talk to Putin about Tomahawks, Peskov said \"there are no clear agreements on a phone call.\"\n\nCould they be a game-changer?\n\nUkraine and its supporters say the supply of Tomahawks would greatly enhance the country's strike capabilities and the threat it poses to Russian assets, such as military bases, energy infrastructure and logistics hubs. Supplying Tomahawks could, as such, be another push factor that brings Russia to the negotiating table with Ukraine and its Western allies, particularly the U.S., wanting to see an end to a war that Moscow began in February 2022. Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Sunday that Kyiv was working closely with the White House to strengthen its defensive capabilities, including its long-range capabilities. \"We see and hear that Russia fears the possibility of the United States providing us with Tomahawks. It is a signal that this kind of pressure can be effective in achieving peace. President Trump and I agreed that our teams and our military will be working on all the matters we discussed,\" he said.\n\nA U.S. ship launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in this undated file photo.

      "content": "Two Paths to Memory Safety: CHERI and OMA in the Fight Against Cyber Threats\n\nThe last year has been brutal for businesses globally. Taking examples from my home country, the UK, the cost is over £1B and still rising, as well as the loss of at least one life due to cybercrime.\n\nThese aren’t isolated incidents - they’re symptoms of a systemic vulnerability in how we build computer systems.\n\nAccording to the Verizon 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report, credential abuse and exploitation of vulnerabilities continue to dominate as attack vectors, accounting for 22% and 20% of breaches respectively. The exploitation of vulnerabilities saw a 34% surge year-over-year, creating what Verizon describes as a “concerning threat landscape”.\n\nWe’re yet to learn the root causes and attack chains involved in each of the examples above, but many involved ransomware, which frequently uses software exploits as a post-initial-access vector to gain control of target systems and spread across a network.\n\nHere’s the kicker: approximately 70% of all software vulnerabilities stem from a single root cause - memory safety issues. This isn’t a new problem. Google, Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla and the Linux Foundation have all reported similar figures for their software over the last two decades. The uncomfortable truth is that current CPUs are fundamentally incapable of preventing these vulnerabilities, and traditional software patches have proven woefully inadequate.\n\nRewriting all the world’s software into memory safe languages, such as C#, Java and Rust, is unviable. While new projects may be adopting Rust over C/C++, and some critical components are being rewritten into safe languages, the scale and depth of the C and C++ ecosystems makes it practically impossible to rewrite all the world’s unsafe software. The risk of introducing other (non-memory-safety) issues during a software rewrite also poses a substantial barrier. Given sufficient software compatibility, it is actually easier to swap the hardware!\n\nTwo architectural approaches have emerged to tackle this trillion-dollar problem at the hardware level:\n\nCHERI : Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions - pioneered at University of Cambridge (UK), and\n\n: Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions - pioneered at University of Cambridge (UK), and OMA: Object Memory Architecture - pioneered at University of Bristol (UK) and now being commercialised by Doubtless Computing.\n\nBoth aim to make memory-unsafe systems safe-by-design but they take different paths to get there. Understanding these differences matters because the choice between them will shape the security and performance characteristics of computing for decades to come.\n\nThe Memory Safety Crisis\n\nBefore diving into solutions, it’s worth understanding what we’re solving. When software runs, it constantly allocates and deallocates memory - think of it like booking rooms in a hotel. Memory safety vulnerabilities arise when this process goes wrong. If you stay in the same hotel twice, you shouldn’t be able to access your old room even if you remember the number (use-after-free/ use-after-reallocate). Similarly, you shouldn’t be able to enter a neighbouring room (buffer overflow), or use a room without booking one in the first place (invalid pointer dereference). Software has these same problems with memory allocations (room bookings).\n\nThese bugs become catastrophic vulnerabilities when attackers exploit them to read sensitive data they shouldn’t access, manipulate critical system variables, or inject malicious code. The underlying architecture of today’s processors - paging-based virtual memory - lacks the granularity needed to enforce security within a single application or process.\n\nMemory safety breaks down into three categories:\n\nReferential safety ensures pointers genuinely reference allocated memory and can’t be forged. Think of it as ensuring software has a valid booking for a room, ensuring accesses to memory are authorized, and that bookings can’t be faked.\n\nensures pointers genuinely reference allocated memory and can’t be forged. Think of it as ensuring software has a valid booking for a room, ensuring accesses to memory are authorized, and that bookings can’t be faked. Spatial safety prevents accessing memory outside allocated bounds - no going into neighbouring rooms.\n\nprevents accessing memory outside allocated bounds - no going into neighbouring rooms. Temporal safety addresses what happens over time, ensuring memory can’t be accessed after it’s been freed and reallocated. In our hotel analogy, a second stay at the hotel shouldn’t allow you to access your previous room, even if you remember the room number.\n\nTraditional architectures like x86, Arm, and RISC-V rely on coarse-grained page-level protection (typically 4KB or larger pages), which is far too blunt an instrument for modern security needs.\n\nCHERI: Capabilities Meet Legacy Systems\n\nCHERI, developed over more than a decade by the University of Cambridge and SRI International, extends conventional instruction set architectures with hardware-enforced capabilities. A CHERI capability is a form of fat pointer - it contains not just a memory address but also bounds information, permissions, and validity metadata. Every memory access gets checked against these constraints in hardware, catching violations before they can be exploited.\n\nThe architecture provides strong referential and spatial safety guarantees. When you have a CHERI capability, you provably have legitimate access to a specific bounded region of memory, and the hardware won’t let you stray outside those bounds. CHERI achieves this while maintaining compatibility with existing paged memory architectures, which is both its greatest strength and a source of limitations.\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting: CHERI’s capabilities are large. On a 64-bit system, a CHERI pointer requires 129 bits (including the hidden tag bit) - essentially double the data width of the base architecture. This decision to encode all protection metadata within the pointer itself has profound implications. Every data structure that stores pointers effectively doubles in memory consumption for those fields. Capabilities in memory (stack/heap) must be aligned to natural 128-bit boundaries. Cache lines, which are precious and limited, now hold fewer actual pointers. Memory bandwidth requirements increase because for each pointer you’re moving twice as much data around.\n\nCHERI provides hardware-enforced referential and spatial safety but leaves temporal safety to software. You can achieve temporal memory safety with CHERI, but it requires modifying your memory allocator and implementing pointer revocation mechanisms - essentially software to scan memory to find and invalidate stale pointers. This software-based approach to temporal safety remains part of the trusted computing base and requires careful verification. It’s also closely related to software garbage collection.\n\nResearch has explored various temporal safety mechanisms for CHERI, but they all involve non-trivial software complexity and performance overhead. In theory, hardware acceleration may be possible but is likely to always require software involvement. This is because a CHERI capability covers a range of memory, which may include more than one object. Software allocation and object type information is required to differentiate objects and thus revoke capabilities appropriately.\n\nThe software ecosystem for CHERI has made impressive progress. Most code recompiles with minimal changes, though the capability width difference can require significant rewrites for certain applications. Additionally, it causes a division in the ISA where load/stores of capabilities must be handled separately from ordinary data. This leads to some complexity in the compiler to detect edge cases where the compiler does not know for certain whether a register or memory slot contains a capability or not. C/C++ code which abuses pointers by treating them as integers, which is uncommon but frequent enough to cause a headache, requires some effort to address.\n\nArm’s Morello project, which implemented CHERI on a modified Neoverse N1 core, revealed performance challenges that have pushed commercial CHERI efforts toward smaller embedded processors for the time being. Notably, Arm declined to join the CHERI Alliance, instead indicating they will take a step back from new work on Morello and wait to see if CHERI gains the long-sought commercial traction.\n\nOMA: Rethinking Memory From the Ground Up\n\nDoubtless Computing’s Object Memory Architecture takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than extending paged memory, OMA implements object-based memory management directly in hardware. Every allocation becomes a first-class hardware object with its own identity, bounds, and metadata maintained by the processor itself.\n\nThis architectural choice enables several key advantages. OMA pointers are leaner - 65 bits on a 64-bit architecture, including the hidden tag bit. Rather than carrying all metadata with every pointer, OMA stores object information centrally in hardware-managed directories. This reduces memory bandwidth requirements and means that multiple pointers to the same object don’t duplicate metadata. The hardware maintains a complete understanding of object relationships and lifecycles, enabling optimizations that software-only approaches can’t match.\n\nA critical differentiator is temporal safety. OMA implements garbage collection in hardware, scanning for and reclaiming unreachable objects in real-time as part of the processor’s normal operation. This isn’t the same as software garbage collection - it’s parallel, highly optimized, and doesn’t block program execution. By managing object lifecycles in hardware, OMA provides hardware-guaranteed temporal safety alongside referential and spatial protections, completing the trinity of memory safety properties.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that memory safety is solved by using a managed language like Java, JavaScript, Swift or Python. Unfortunately, this doesn’t hold up in practice. Managed language runtimes, as well as many supporting libraries, are written in C/C++ and suffer memory safety issues just as much as any other C/C++ code. The operating systems and hypervisors are also exposed to these languages, offering yet another attack surface. This leaves managed language apps vulnerable. Memory safe languages, including both Rust and managed languages, are a distinct improvement over traditional C and C++, but only hardware can provide the safety guarantees we need in today’s systems.\n\nFor managed languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, C# and Go, the OMA architecture delivers dramatic performance improvements. Doubtless Computing’s analysis of CPython 3.12 reveals that 32-44% of instructions are spent on memory management operations - allocation, deallocation, reference counting, and garbage collection. Moving these operations into parallel hardware execution, along with microarchitectural optimisations derived from hardware’s new understanding of the structure of data in memory, yields 2-5x speedups for managed language applications. Even C/C++ applications see 1.2-2x improvements as the hardware optimizes memory management functions and eliminates per-object metadata from cache.\n\nThe architecture maintains full source code compatibility for managed languages - all changes are confined to the runtime. For C/C++, the story is much the same as with CHERI: recompilation with modified standard libraries and a modified compiler, such as LLVM or GCC. Maintaining the pointer width the same as the data width, and the same alignment requirements, avoids the ISA-level split for handling pointers, which simplifies the compiler and improves compatibility with legacy C/C++ code. This compatibility approach differs from CHERI’s and aligns with OMA’s target market: server-class and application processors, where managed languages dominate.\n\nFundamental Trade-offs: Where the Architectures Diverge\n\nThe philosophical differences between CHERI and OMA create distinct trade-off profiles. CHERI carries all metadata with pointers, enabling incremental adoption where different parts of a program can use capabilities independently. OMA’s centralized metadata requires the hardware to maintain a consistent view of all objects but enables more aggressive optimization. CHERI works within the existing paged memory model, simplifying system software migration. OMA introduces a new memory model that requires deeper changes but delivers performance gains that paged architectures can’t match.\n\nThese differences manifest in pointer width - CHERI’s 129-bit capabilities versus OMA’s 65-bit pointers. While both exceed the base address width, the doubling effect in CHERI has more severe implications for data structure layouts, cache efficiency, and memory bandwidth. Research on CHERI implementations has shown there is a long road ahead to achieve performance parity for managed languages. In the meantime, OMA offers a shorter path with substantial speedups rather than equal performance.\n\nTemporal safety represents perhaps the most significant divergence in security. CHERI’s software-based pointer revocation requires explicit memory scanning and manipulation, adding complexity to the trusted computing base and verification burden. OMA’s hardware garbage collection happens transparently and continuously, providing stronger guarantees with less software complexity. This matters enormously for total cost of ownership - every line of security-critical software that doesn’t need to be written, verified, and maintained is a win.\n\nThe instruction set philosophies differ too. CHERI historically opts for ISA changes beyond pure memory safety to achieve its security goals, which can complicate adoption. OMA has historically prioritized backward compatibility, though this is adaptable based on market requirements. The consensus in the industry is that software compatibility presents the primary barrier to new processor designs, which favours architectures that minimize disruption.\n\nIndustrial Relevance and Market Fit\n\nCHERI and OMA target fundamentally different computing environments, which is why calling them competitors misses the point. They’re complementary solutions to a shared problem, each optimized for distinct use cases.\n\nCHERI finds its natural home in embedded systems and microcontrollers. These environments predominantly use C, C++, or Rust with restricted or no dynamic memory allocation. The code bases are smaller and more amenable to the verification required to ensure CHERI capabilities are used correctly. The memory overhead from wider pointers, while still present, matters less in resource-constrained designs that carefully manage every allocation. Four companies - SCI Semiconductor, Codasip, lowRISC, and Secqai - are actively commercializing CHERI for embedded applications. SCI’s ICENI family of CHERIoT microcontrollers, built on Microsoft’s open-source CHERIoT-Ibex core, targets the IoT and operational technology markets. Codasip offers CHERI-enabled RISC-V IP cores for custom processor designs. lowRISC’s Sonata platform provides an open-source FPGA-based development environment for CHERIoT research and prototyping.\n\nArm’s experience with CHERI tells an important story about scaling limitations. The Morello project, which implemented CHERI on a modified Neoverse N1 server-class core, yielded results that Arm appears to have found unsatisfactory. There has been no apparent follow-up on the substantial initial investment made into the Arm Morello designs. This assessment seems to reflect the performance challenges that CHERI faces in larger systems.\n\nOMA’s sweet spot sits at the opposite end of the spectrum. Application-class and server-class processors running managed languages benefit enormously from hardware-accelerated memory management. Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Go all share similar memory models that align naturally with OMA’s object-based approach. These environments already use garbage collection extensively, so moving that functionality into hardware removes overhead, rather than adding it as it would in embedded systems. The performance gains - up to 5x for managed languages - become transformational for data centre workloads where every percentage point of efficiency translates to millions in operating costs.\n\nThe market dynamics favour different adoption paths. CHERI benefits from strong government backing, particularly from the now-ended UK’s Digital Security by Design programme and recognition from the US White House and NSA. This institutional support hopes to accelerate adoption in defence and critical infrastructure applications. CHERI’s open-source foundation through the CHERI Alliance creates a broad ecosystem but limits opportunities for proprietary differentiation.\n\nOMA’s proprietary nature and performance advantages position it for commercial data centre deployment. The technology directly addresses the performance problems that hindered CHERI at scale. While OMA lacks CHERI’s first-mover advantage and government momentum, it offers compelling value for cloud providers and enterprises running managed language workloads. The economic argument is straightforward: if you can eliminate 70% of vulnerabilities while quintupling performance for your Python services, the return on investment is measured in weeks from deployment, rather than years.\n\nOMA’s proprietary technology makes it attractive for investment as it can be patented. However, CHERI’s openness makes it possible for independent security teams to verify the safety of the architecture. Open implementations of CHERI processors also enables those designs to be independently verified. Doubtless Computing will need to make its ISA public, which is inevitable anyway for a new CPU as customers will require it. Doubtless will also need to offer a public platform for independent researchers to build confidence in the security claims.\n\nThe CHERI Ecosystem: Who’s Building What\n\nThe CHERI Alliance, formally launched in 2024, coordinates standardization and adoption efforts across industry and academia. Founding members include the FreeBSD Foundation, Capabilities Limited, SCI Semiconductor, Codasip, lowRISC, and the University of Cambridge. Google’s participation as a founding member signals serious industry interest, though notably Arm is not a member.\n\nSCI Semiconductor, based in Cambridge, leads commercialization of Microsoft’s open-source CHERIoT Ibex implementation for embedded systems. Their ICENI family of processors targets microcontroller applications in automotive, industrial control, defence, and aerospace. The company has secured strategic distribution through EPS Global, which specializes in automotive tier-one suppliers and contract manufacturers. SCI’s early access program, in collaboration with lowRISC, allows select partners to begin development on lowRISC’s FPGA-based Sonata platform with guaranteed migration paths to production silicon.\n\nCodasip, a RISC-V processor IP vendor, offers the X730 - a CHERI-enabled 64-bit application-class core based on their A730 design. Their “Custom Compute” methodology allows customers to license CHERI-enhanced cores or customize them further using Codasip Studio. The company has donated a CHERI SDK built on open-source tools to the CHERI Alliance, making it freely available for anyone implementing CHERI on RISC-V. Codasip is also developing Linux kernel support for RISC-V CHERI, which will be crucial for broader adoption.\n\nlowRISC, a not-for-profit organization spun out of Cambridge University, maintains the Sonata evaluation platform and leads the UK-government-funded Sunburst Project. Sonata provides a complete FPGA-based development environment for CHERIoT, enabling software development and hardware experimentation before silicon is available. The Sunburst Project’s recent expansion to include SCI Semiconductor aims to validate CHERIoT designs through commercial tapeout on GlobalFoundries’ 22nm process, with all project deliverables remaining open-source.\n\nzeroRISC is a startup and partner in the OpenTitan project administered by lowRISC. Their goal is to commercialise the OpenTitan silicon IP through their Integrity Management Platform.\n\nMicrosoft’s role deserves special mention. Microsoft Research developed CHERIoT-Ibex, an open-source RISC-V core optimized for embedded systems. They’ve made this core freely available and co-maintain the CHERIoT Platform repository with SCI Semiconductor. David Weston, Microsoft’s VP of Enterprise and OS Security, has publicly endorsed SCI’s commercialization efforts, stating that CHERI represents a “promising technology that can be used to enhance computer security.” This corporate backing from a major software vendor adds credibility to the embedded CHERI ecosystem.\n\nThe UK government’s support through the now-ended Digital Security by Design programme and UKRI funding has been instrumental in advancing CHERI. The programme provided ~£190 million in research funding over five years and continues to support development through initiatives like Sunburst. This institutional backing, combined with endorsements from the US White House and NSA, positions CHERI advantageously for government and defence procurements.\n\nConclusions\n\nCHERI and OMA represent two responses to the memory safety crisis, each with distinct strengths that make them suited to different computing environments. The notion that one must “win” while the other “loses” misunderstands the landscape - the computing world is large enough, and varied enough, that multiple approaches can and should coexist. Cybersecurity principles also demand diversity of solutions.\n\nCHERI’s compatibility with existing paged memory architectures and incremental deployment model make it an excellent fit for embedded systems where code bases are manageable, languages are predominantly C/C++/Rust, and the verification burden is acceptable. The active CHERI ecosystem, backed by government support and open-source collaboration, has created momentum that shouldn’t be underestimated. For IoT devices, industrial control systems, and safety-critical embedded applications, CHERI offers a practical path to hardware-enforced memory safety that companies can adopt today.\n\nOMA’s object-based architecture and integrated hardware garbage collection (IHGC) deliver transformational performance for managed language workloads. By tackling temporal safety in hardware alongside referential and spatial protections, OMA provides more complete memory safety with less software complexity. The performance gains - up to 5x for Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Go - directly address the scalability problems that have limited CHERI in larger systems. For data centres, cloud infrastructure, and application servers where managed languages dominate, OMA presents compelling advantages.\n\nBoth architectures eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities. The formal guarantees that CHERI can provide are a subset of what OMA delivers, since OMA includes hardware-enforced temporal safety. However, CHERI’s earlier start and ecosystem momentum matter significantly in technology adoption. The question isn’t which architecture is “better” in absolute terms but rather which is more appropriate for specific use cases and deployment contexts.\n\nLooking ahead, memory safety will increasingly become a non-negotiable requirement. The UK National Cyber Security Centre, US White House, and NSA have all called for fundamental changes in how we build secure systems. The attacks on Marks & Spencer, Co-op, Jaguar Land Rover, the NHS, Transport for London, and many others, demonstrate that our current approach isn’t working. Software-only solutions like Rust, while valuable, face adoption barriers that make them insufficient on their own. Hardware-based memory safety, whether through CHERI, OMA, or future approaches we haven’t yet invented, represents the most practical path to eliminating this class of vulnerability at scale.\n\nThe semiconductor industry moves slowly, with design cycles measured in years and deployment timelines measured in decades. Today’s architectural decisions will shape computing security through 2040 and beyond. The good news is that we now have proven approaches to memory safety that work in real hardware. CHERI has demonstrated its viability in embedded systems. OMA has shown it can deliver both security and performance for managed languages with a hardware prototype on AWS Cloud FPGAs supporting CPython 3.12 and Jupyter Notebooks. The challenge now isn’t technical feasibility - it’s economic deployment and ecosystem coordination.\n\nFor embedded designers, CHERI offers immediate benefits with manageable overhead. For cloud and data centre operators, OMA promises to eliminate vulnerabilities while dramatically improving performance. The fundamental insight is that both approaches work by making the right choices for their target markets. We don’t need to pick one winner. We need both, deployed where each makes the most sense, steadily displacing the insecure architectures that enabled the attacks we’ve seen this year. The trillion-dollar memory safety problem is solvable - and the will to deploy the solutions we’ve built is growing as organisations can no longer afford the risk of being vulnerable.",

      "content": "In the latest bid by a Silicon Valley defense firm to assert its own solution for the Army’s mixed-reality ambitions, Anduril Industries on Monday unveiled “EagleEye,” a helmeted computing system that seeks to turn soldiers into AI-augmented warfighters.\n\nThe launch is notable given that the initiative is led by Anduri’s co-founder Palmer Luckey, who previously started the pioneering VR company, Oculus, which was acquired by Meta.\n\nAnduril describes EagleEye as a modular “family of systems” built atop its Lattice software that puts command-and-control tools, sensor feeds, and AI directly into a soldier’s field of vision.\n\nThe company claims the system can integrate live video feeds; features rear- and side-sensors to alert operators to threats; and can track teammates in real-time. EagleEye variations include a helmet, visor and glasses.\n\nThe launch comes as the U.S. Army looks to expand its pool of mixed-reality gear suppliers. It had been using Microsoft’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), a $22 billion program awarded in 2018, but after years of issues, the Army handed control of the contract to Anduril this February.\n\nThen in September, Anduril won a $159 million award to prototype a new mixed-reality system for soldiers, part of a broader Soldier Borne Mission Command effort. Anduril said the award was “the largest effort of its kind” to outfit “every soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities.”\n\nEarlier this year, Anduril also announced a partnership with Meta to develop extended reality (XR) devices for the military, marking an unexpected reunion between Luckey and his former employer.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "content": "In March 2019 as a nationwide blackout plunged Venezuela into darkness, hundreds of citizens huddled on a basketball court in the city of Maracaibo to hear their leader promise to guide them out of the gloom.\n\n“We are, quite literally, living through our darkest hour. But these are also the brightest of times,” María Corina Machado told supporters as they used mobile phones to illuminate the night.\n\nSix and a half years later, on Friday Machado used almost identical words to celebrate winning the Nobel peace prize for her “extraordinary” – yet incomplete – struggle against Venezuela’s “brutal, authoritarian state” under the president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\n“We are … living the darkest hours. But at the same time there is enormous hope,” Machado declared after hearing the news, before vowing: “Venezuela will be free.”\n\nFor all Machado’s relentless optimism, one question lingered after Friday’s surprise announcement in Oslo: this time, was she right? Would receiving the prestigious prize advance Machado’s tenacious campaign to unseat Maduro, or could it backfire and lead to greater repression from the autocrat’s feared security forces?\n\nInternational supporters voiced confidence that political change was coming for a country that has slipped into authoritarianism and economic malfunction since Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013, with about 8 million citizens fleeing abroad. “The thirst for democracy always prevails,” wrote the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nCarlos Lizarralde, the author of a book about Venezuela’s collapse, said the prize would boost Machado by “cementing her position in the eyes of the international community … as the one credible opposition leader” in the South American country.\n\n“A Nobel laureate, in many ways, is the secular equivalent of a living saint. This perfectly complements her quasi-religious public image,” Lizarralde said of Machado, a devout Catholic who before going into hiding after last year’s rigged presidential election attended rallies clutching a rosary and wearing crosses around her neck.\n\nOthers are more sceptical. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela expert, said the prize would “definitely draw more international attention to the Venezuelan conflict and perhaps [create] more resolve” to end it.\n\n“But judging by past Nobel winners, it will not be fundamental,” Smilde added, noting how the 1994 prize shared by Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin did not fundamentally reconfigure the interests and forces involved in the Middle East conflict.\n\nRonald Krebs, a political scientist who has studied the impact of Nobel peace prizes awarded in the hope of promoting political change in authoritarian countries, said his research showed they rarely succeeded.\n\nKrebs cited Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese poet and activist who received the prize in 2010 while in prison – a decision Beijing called an “anti-China farce”. Liu died seven years later, still in custody and with his homeland having become an even more repressive one-party state under its Communist party leader, Xi Jinping.\n\nIn 2003, the Iranian activist Shirin Ebadi was honoured for her struggle for democracy and human rights. Krebs said becoming a laureate “insulated” Ebadi from persecution since Tehran feared jailing such a high-profile figure. “But it did absolutely nothing for those who were not similarly protected … if anything they were further repressed because of the Nobel peace prize,” he said.\n\nKrebs said peace prizes could inspire human rights defenders “to come forward with greater vigour”. “[But] at the same time it gives the repressive regime even more incentive to repress those who would seek to effect change. [So] it creates a really problematic and worrisome dynamic that … ultimately works to the detriment of those who are advocating for domestic political change … The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”\n\nAllies hope Machado’s prize will “bulletproof” her against regime reprisals. But Krebs said it was “extraordinarily doubtful” it would produce democratic change.\n\nAndrés Izarra, a former minister for Maduro’s mentor Chávez, was also doubtful, although he said Venezuela’s authoritarian president was facing the greatest challenge of his 12-year reign.\n\nInternationally isolated after being accused of stealing last year’s election from Machado’s ally Edmundo González, Maduro is also facing an unprecedented US pressure campaign that many suspect is aimed at forcing regime change.\n\nSince August, Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, with a series of deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling boats. “There’s never been a clearer chance of displacing [Maduro] from power than now,” Izarra said.\n\nBut the ex-minister dismissed the idea that Trump’s pressure campaign would “break” Maduro’s regime by sparking a military revolt. Izarra also doubted Trump would invade. “What you have in the Caribbean is a regime change operation … but it’s a performative one,” he said, designed to coerce Maduro into making concessions during secret talks Izarra believes are happening between US and Venezuelan officials.\n\n“This is all going to resolve itself at the negotiating table,” Izarra predicted. Maduro and his allies were “never going to surrender power voluntarily” but equally Trump would never alienate his anti-intervention Maga movement by putting boots on the ground. “They don’t want forever wars. They don’t want Vietnam. They don’t want Iraq,” Izarra said.\n\nPerhaps the only certainty is that Machado, a famously stubborn Margaret Thatcher-admiring conservative known as Venezuela’s “Iron Lady”, is unlikely to turn.\n\n“She’s a true fighter,” said Lizarralde, predicting Machado would battle on. “In her mind, this is an epic struggle between good and evil … and she [is convinced she] represents good.”",

      "description": "College price tags are daunting, but hefty discounting \"goes on behind the scenes,\" often as merit aid, The New York Times columnist Ron Lieber says.",
      "content": "Ivy League architecture at Princeton University. Loop Images | Getty Images\n\nVery few things are as expensive as a college education. The sticker price is shocking: The cost of attendance at some schools nears six figures a year, after factoring in tuition, fees, room and board, books, transportation and other expenses. But most people don't pay that much, or even close. \"There's a lot of money flowing around, a lot of discounts,\" The New York Times columnist and author Ron Lieber said Friday at the 2025 Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing's Personal Finance Summit in New York.\n\nOften in the form of merit aid, the average tuition discount for first-time, full-time students at private colleges is roughly 56%, Lieber previously reported. But \"all of this discounting … goes on behind the scenes,\" said Lieber, who is the author of \"The Price You Pay for College.\"\n\nOver time, there has been a slow shift to a \"high-tuition, high-aid\" model, where colleges both raise tuition and increase grant aid, according to Emily Cook, an assistant professor of economics at Texas A&M University. Now, about two-thirds of all full-time students receive some sort of financial assistance, which can bring college costs significantly down. \"The list price is not the actual price,\" Lieber said at Friday's event, which was co-sponsored by the National Endowment for Financial Education.\n\nThe net price students and their families pay for college is the tuition cost minus grants, scholarships and other types of aid. However, \"every school calculates aid differently,\" said Robert Franek, editor-in-chief of The Princeton Review, \"leaving families desperate for transparency and predictability.\" \"Tuition discounting is a big part of how this evolved,\" Franek said. \"Colleges rely on higher sticker prices to fund the aid that brings many students' costs back down. But the optics are daunting — and for families who don't yet know their aid package, that six-figure number can feel like a closed door.\" Price is now the biggest consideration among students and parents when choosing a college, according to The Princeton Review. Financial concerns govern decision-making for 8 in 10 families, a report by education lender Sallie Mae also found — outweighing even academics when deciding between schools. For most college-bound students and their parents, it often comes down to their \"ability to pay\" and their \"willingness to pay,\" Lieber said. \"Schools are trying to guess exactly where you are on that continuum.\"\n\nWhat is a college degree worth?\n\nStudies show that most people believe the value of a degree still far outweighs the cost. \"A mountain of research shows that college remains a worthwhile investment and the most powerful path to economic mobility,\" said Sameer Gadkaree, the president and CEO of The Institute for College Access & Success. However, many factors — including how much financial aid is offered and how much students have to pay out of pocket, as well as the choice of major, future earnings potential and how long it takes to graduate — determine the actual return on investment, according to a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",

      "description": "Price, quality, speed, and relationships all matter.",
      "content": "Cards Against Humanity (CAH) this week announced its newest stunt: a \"Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke\" edition that ditches the game's rules and adds explanatory notes to each card in the box. This makes the project \"informational material\" rather than a \"game,\" and therefore CAH can avoid import tariffs. All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship.\n\nWhile a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week's news did raise a question I've heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn't it print the game in the US? I mean, it's just a box of cards! How hard can it be?\n\nIn the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it's often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).\n\nEarlier this year, for instance, I quoted two board game designers who had looked into US production and found it infeasible.\n\nJamey Stegmaier, who has published hits like Scythe, Viticulture, and Wingspan, wrote, \"I recall getting quoted a cost of $10 for just a standard empty box from a company in the US that specializes in making boxes,\" though a full game can be made and boxed in China for the same amount.",
