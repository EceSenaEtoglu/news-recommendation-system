      "title": "Chinese EV players take fight to legacy European automakers on their home turf",
      "description": "Chinese electric carmakers Xpeng and GAC this week signalled aggressive expansion plans in Europe.",
      "content": "Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng speaks to reporters at the electric carmaker's stand at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nGermany this week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf. The IAA Mobility conference in Munich was packed full of companies with huge stands showing off their latest cars and technology. Among some of the biggest displays were those from Chinese electric car companies, underscoring their ambitions to expand beyond China. Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. At the same time, Tesla , which was for so long seen as the electric vehicle market leader, has seen sales decline in the region. Despite Chinese EV makers facing tariffs from the European Union, players from the world's second-largest economy have responded to the ramping up of competition by setting aggressive sales and expansion targets. \"The current growth of Xpeng globally is faster than we have expected,\" He Xiaopeng, the CEO of Xpeng told CNBC in an interview this week.\n\nAggressive expansion plans\n\nChinese carmakers who spoke to CNBC at the IAA show signaled their ambitious expansion plans. Xpeng's He said in an interview that the company is looking to launch its mass-market Mona series in Europe next year. In China, Xpeng's Mona cars start at the equivalent of just under $17,000. Bringing this to Europe would add some serious price competition.\n\nwatch now\n\nMeanwhile, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) is targeting rapid growth of its sales in Europe. Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC that the company aims to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year and at least 50,000 units by 2027. GAC also announced plans to bring two EVs — the Aion V and Aion UT — to Europe. Leapmotor was also in attendance with their own stand. There are signs that Chinese players have made early in roads into Europe. The market share of Chinese car brands in Europe nearly doubled in the first half of the year versus the same period in 2024, though it still remains low at just over 5%, according to Jato Dynamics. \"The significant presence of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers at the IAA Mobility, signals their growing ambitions and confidence in the European market,\" Murtuza Ali, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nTech and gadgets in focus\n\nMany of the Chinese car firms have positioned themselves as technology companies, much like Tesla, and their cars highlight that. Many of the electric vehicles have big screens equipped with flashy interfaces and voice assistants. And in a bid to lure buyers, some companies have included additional gadgets. For example, GAC's Aion V sported a refrigerator as well as a massage function as part of the seating.\n\nThe Aion V is one of the cars GAC is launching in Europe as it looks to expand its presence in the region. The Aion V is on display at the company's stand at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich, Germany on September 9, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nThis is one way that the Chinese players sought to differentiate themselves from legacy brands. \"The chances of success for Chinese automakers are strong, especially as they have an edge in terms of affordability, battery technology, and production scale,\" Counterpoint's Ali said.\n\nEurope's carmakers push back\n\nLegacy carmakers sought to flex their own muscles at the IAA with Volskwagen , BMW and Mercedes having among the biggest stands at the show. Mercedes in particular had advertising displayed all across the front entrance of the event. BMW, like the Chinese players, had a big focus on technology by talking up its so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system. BMW, which introduced the iX3 at the event, and chipmaker Qualcomm also announced assisted driving software that the two companies co-developed. Volkswagen and French auto firm Renault also showed off some new electric cars. Regardless of the product blitz, there are still concerns that European companies are not moving fast enough. BMW's new iX3 is based on the electric vehicle platform it first debuted two years ago. Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers have been quick in bringing out and launching newer models. \"A commitment to legacy structures and incrementalism has slowed its ability to build and leverage a robust EV ecosystem, leaving it behind fast moving rivals,\" Tammy Madsen, professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said of BMW. While European autos have a strong brand history and their CEOs acknowledged and welcomed the competition this week in interviews with CNBC, the Chinese are not letting up.\n\nwatch now",

      "title": "'If We Want Bigger Wind Turbines, We're Gonna Need Bigger Airplanes'",
      "description": "Long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 shared this article from IEEE Spectrum:\n\nThe world's largest airplane, when it's built, will stretch more than a football field from tip to tail. Sixty percent longer than the biggest existing aircraft, with 12 times as much cargo space as a 747, the behemoth will look like an oil tanker that's sprouted wings &mdash; aeronautical engineering at a preposterous scale. \n\nCalled WindRunner, and expected by 2030, it'll haul just one thing: massive wind-turbine blades. In most parts of the world, onshore wind-turbine blades can be built to a length of 70 meters, max. This size constraint comes not from the limits of blade engineering or physics; it's transportation. Any larger and the blades couldn't be moved over land, since they wouldn't fit through tunnels or overpasses, or be able to accommodate some of the sharper curves of roads and rails. \n\nSo the WindRunner's developer, Radia of Boulder, Colorado, has staked its business model on the idea that the only way to get extralarge blades to wind farms is to fly them there... Radia's plane will be able to hold two 95-meter blades or one 105-meter blade, and land on makeshift dirt runways adjacent to wind farms. This may sound audacious &mdash; an act of hubris undertaken for its own sake. But Radia's supporters argue that WindRunner is simply the right tool for the job &mdash; the only way to make onshore wind turbines bigger. Bigger turbines, after all, can generate more energy at a lower cost per megawatt. But the question is: Will supersizing airplanes be worth the trouble...? \n\nHaving fewer total turbines means a wind farm could space them farther apart, avoiding airflow interference. The turbines would be nearly twice as tall, so they'll reach a higher, gustier part of the atmosphere. And big turbines don't need to spin as quickly, so they would make economic sense in places with average wind speeds around 5 meters per second compared with the roughly 7 m/s needed to sustain smaller units. \"The result...is more than a doubling of the acres in the world where wind is viable,\" says Mark Lundstrom [Radia's founder and CEO]. \n\nThe executive director at America's National Renewable Energy Laboratory Foundation points out that one day blades could just be 3D-printed on-site &mdash; negating the need for the airplane altogether. But 3D printing for turbines is still in its earliest stages.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status='If+We+Want+Bigger+Wind+Turbines%2C+We're+Gonna+Need+Bigger+Airplanes'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0224231%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0224231%2Fif-we-want-bigger-wind-turbines-were-gonna-need-bigger-airplanes%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/09/15/0224231/if-we-want-bigger-wind-turbines-were-gonna-need-bigger-airplanes?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "Businesses are overwhelmingly relying on Anthropic's AI software to automate rather than collaborate on work, according to a new report from the OpenAI rival, adding to the risk that AI will upend livelihoods. From a report: More than three quarters (77%) of companies' usage of Anthropic's Claude AI software involved automation patterns, often including \"full task delegation,\" according to a research report the startup released on Monday. The finding was based on an analysis of traffic from Anthropic's application programming interface, which is used by developers and businesses. \n\n[...] On the whole, Anthropic found businesses primarily use Claude for administrative tasks and coding, the latter of which has been a key focus for the company and much of the AI industry. Anthropic, OpenAI and other AI developers have released more sophisticated AI tools that can write and debug code on a user's behalf.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Anthropic+Finds+Businesses+Are+Mainly+Using+AI+To+Automate+Work%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F1520249%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F1520249%2Fanthropic-finds-businesses-are-mainly-using-ai-to-automate-work%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/25/09/15/1520249/anthropic-finds-businesses-are-mainly-using-ai-to-automate-work?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "At the WIRED Health summit, biochemist David Liu said his lab is on the verge of revealing a new gene-editing technique that could target multiple unrelated diseases.",
      "content": "At the WIRED Health summit last week, Harvard biochemist and gene-editing pioneer David Liu said that later this year his lab plans to report on a single gene-editing strategy that could treat many unrelated diseases. He calls it disease-agnostic therapeutic gene editing.\n\n“It sounds sort of crazy, but there’s actually a very good molecular biology reason why this could be possible,” he told the audience in Boston, stopping short of details.\n\nGene-editing treatments are currently being developed for several rare and inherited genetic diseases. One gene-editing treatment, called Casgevy, is approved and available commercially to treat sickle cell disease and a related blood disorder called beta thalassemia. Earlier this year, KJ Muldoon, a baby boy born with an often fatal genetic disease that causes ammonia to build up in his blood, was saved with a customized gene-editing treatment—a medical first.\n\nThese treatments work by targeting specific mutations related to those diseases. But they can be costly to develop and must be designed for specific patient populations. Sometimes those patient populations can be very small, as in the case of baby KJ. His condition, called CPS1 deficiency, affects just one in 1.3 million live births.\n\nLiu envisions a future in which one gene-editing approach could be used on multiple different diseases, regardless of what organ or tissue they affect or their genetic cause. He says this kind of streamlined strategy is needed because collectively, there are so many rare diseases, and it would be impractical to design treatments for each one. Global Genes, a rare disease advocacy organization, estimates that there are at least 10,000 rare diseases that affect more than 400 million people worldwide.\n\nPHOTOGRAPH: VAIL FUCCI\n\n“Genetic disease as a whole is not so rare. It’s actually many times more prevalent than cancer or HIV/AIDS,” Liu said. “We urgently need these ways to directly treat the root cause of these genetic diseases.”",

      "description": "Representatives from the Arab and Muslim world have gathered in Doha to respond to Israel’s attack on Qatar.",
      "content": "Representatives from the Arab and Muslim world have gathered in Doha to respond to Israel’s attack on Qatar.\n\nLeaders from across the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have gathered in Doha for an Arab-Islamic summit to forge a unified stance on Israel following its attack on a Hamas office in Qatar’s capital on September 9 that killed six people.\n\nThe emergency summit of the Arab League and OIC began on Monday, following a closed-door meeting of foreign ministers in Doha, where a draft resolution outlining concrete measures against Israel was prepared.\n\n“It’s time for the international community to abandon dual standards and to hold Israel accountable for all the crimes it has committed,” Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani said before the meeting, adding that the attack must be met with “fierce” and “firm” measures.\n\nThe Qatari leader also chided Israel’s continuous derailment of Gaza ceasefire talks, stating: “Israel must know that the continuous genocidal war against the Palestinian people, aiming at forcibly transferring them outside their homeland, cannot succeed, no matter what false justification is provided.”\n\nIsrael’s attack on Qatar was part of a broader wave of strikes extending beyond its borders, marking the sixth country Israel had targeted in 72 hours and the seventh since the start of this year.\n\nWho are the 22 members of the Arab League?\n\nAmong the attendees are representatives from the Arab League, a group of 22 member nations stretching from North Africa to the Gulf and representing primarily Arab-majority states, with a combined population of nearly 500 million — about six percent of the world’s population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficially known as the League of Arab States, the Arab League was established in Cairo on March 22, 1945, by seven founding members: Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan (now Jordan), Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen. Its creation reflected the shared desire of Arab countries emerging from colonial rule to coordinate their political stances, promote regional solidarity and safeguard their sovereignty and independence.\n\nOver the decades, membership grew to 22 states, stretching from North Africa to the Gulf. Egypt was suspended in 1979 after signing a peace treaty with Israel, but its membership was reinstated in 1989. Libya was suspended during the 2011 uprising but readmitted later that year. Syria was suspended in 2011 amid its civil war and reinstated in 2023.\n\nThe group accounts for about 3.25 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), with several members ranked among the world’s leading oil producers.\n\nCountries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, and Algeria are also part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and hold some of the largest proven oil reserves. Collectively, Arab League members produce about a quarter of the world’s oil.\n\nAll Arab League members are also part of the 57-member OIC.\n\nWho are the 57 members of the OIC?\n\nThe OIC, which was formed in 1969 in response to an arson attack on Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque, brings together 57 countries with significant Muslim populations across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas.\n\nIn September 1969, Muslim leaders met in Rabat, Morocco, to establish a body that would safeguard Islamic holy sites, protect shared political and economic interests, and promote solidarity among Muslim-majority nations on the global stage.\n\nOver time, its membership expanded from 30 to 57 states, reflecting its growing reach. Today, the OIC represents more than 2.1 billion people — about 26 percent of the world’s population and 8 percent of the world’s GDP.\n\nIn its early years, the OIC had loose membership rules. Its original charter allowed any Muslim state to join with the approval of two-thirds of existing members, which opened the door for countries without Muslim majorities but with significant Muslim populations. These include Gabon, the Maldives, Mauritania, Uganda, Mozambique, Cameroon, Togo, Benin, the Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nIn the Americas, Guyana and Suriname joined despite having relatively small Muslim communities.\n\nThe 2008 charter revision made membership stricter. Now, a country must be a United Nations member (with Palestine as the exception), have a Muslim-majority population, abide by the charter and apply formally. Even then, admission requires consensus among all 57 members — a difficult task.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlbania is the only European state in the OIC.\n\nThe organisation has maintained a consistent and forceful stance against Israeli actions, particularly regarding occupation and military offensives in Palestine.\n\nOver the past three years, the OIC has convened several emergency summits and ministerial meetings — most notably in Riyadh, Jeddah and Istanbul – to condemn Israeli attacks on Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and, more recently, strikes involving Iran and Qatar.\n\nThe group has repeatedly called for immediate ceasefires, protection of Palestinian civilians and international accountability for what it describes as “Israeli crimes”.",

      "description": "RestOfWorld.org reports on \"a global crisis nobody anticipated when governments started subsidizing electric vehicles...\" \n\n\"EVs can lose almost half their driving distance when temperatures drop, and the billions spent on improving technology have failed to fix this fundamental limitation.\"\n\nIn January, Seattle-based Recurrent, a company that tests and analyzes EVs, found an average range loss of 20% in extreme cold... Lithium-ion batteries rely on chemical reactions that slow dramatically in cold weather. When temperatures plunge, the electrolyte thickens, ions move sluggishly, and charging becomes not just inefficient but potentially dangerous. Charging in cold weather has been identified as a primary cause of thermal acceleration, which can lead to fires... \nThe failure pattern repeats globally wherever cold weather meets inadequate infrastructure. Manufacturers, too, have acknowledged the problem. Chinese EV maker BYD's user manual, for instance, advises drivers to charge indoors, with the heating on. That advice is useless for farmers parking in open courtyards. \nIn fact, research across 293 Chinese cities \"found that many drivers in colder regions buy EVs only as supplementary vehicles,\" according to the article, \"while still relying on gasoline-powered cars during winter.\" \nThe article also tells the story of an apple grower chilly Kashmir, India who discovered that his Chinese three-wheeler lost 60% of its 10-hour charge overnight. This made it impossible to begin the 56-kilometer (35-mile) trip on a route with no charging stations &mdash; and prevented him from selling his produce while it was fresh (to earn the highest prices). And the problem affects the entire region:\n\nDesperate drivers have formed WhatsApp groups, such as \"EV Apple Transporters\" and \"Battery Help Kashmir,\" sharing increasingly absurd workarounds. Some have wrapped batteries in quilts; others have hauled power packs weighing 90 kilograms (over 200 pounds) into their homes for the night. One driver parked his battery in the living room. \"The blankets caused overheating on the road; water bottles leaked into the circuits,\" [orchard owner] Sajad Ahmad said. \"We became mechanics, engineers, and fools all at once.\" EVs are also not considered cost-efficient. \"Diesel vans are expensive, but they can do four or five trips a day,\" Mohammad Yaseen, a driver based in Shopian, told Rest of World. \"With EVs, one half-trip and you're stuck.\" \n\nNorway, where winter temperatures average minus 7 degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit), achieved 89% EV market share with its comprehensive infrastructure. It offers more than 200 models for year-round usage. \"The ability to preheat batteries upon fast charging in winter is by far the most important improvement we have seen in the past five years,\" Christina Bu, secretary-general of the Norwegian EV Association, told Rest of World.\n \n\"These features are standard in Norway's mature market, but remain absent from basic models exported to developing countries.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+World's+EV+Owners+Discover+Unheated+Batteries+Lose+Distance+in+Freezing+Weather%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0035239%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0035239%2Fthe-worlds-ev-owners-discover-unheated-batteries-lose-distance-in-freezing-weather%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/09/15/0035239/the-worlds-ev-owners-discover-unheated-batteries-lose-distance-in-freezing-weather?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "America's Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Amazon and Google misled advertisers placing ads on their websites, reports Bloomberg, and specifically whether the two companies \"properly disclosed the terms and pricing for ads.\"\n\nThe FTC is seeking details about Amazon's auctions and whether it disclosed \"reserve pricing\" for some search ads &mdash; price floors that advertisers must meet before they can buy an ad, the people said. Separately, the FTC is examining practices by Google, including its internal pricing process and whether it increased the cost of ads in ways that weren't disclosed to advertisers, the people said... \n\nAccording to one of the people, the FTC's latest investigation emerged from its earlier antitrust case. In that complaint, the agency alleges that Amazon litters its marketplace with irrelevant results for search queries, making it harder for shoppers to find what they are looking for and more expensive for sellers to use the platform. The practice effectively forces sellers to buy ads to make their product appear in response to consumer searches.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=America's+FTC+Opens+New+Probe+into+Amazon+and+Google+Advertising+Practices%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F1638247%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F1638247%2Famericas-ftc-opens-new-probe-into-amazon-and-google-advertising-practices%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/09/14/1638247/americas-ftc-opens-new-probe-into-amazon-and-google-advertising-practices?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there’s a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.”\n\nSpecifically, Taylor compared today’s AI landscape to the dot-com bubble of the late ‘90s. While many companies failed when the bubble burst, he argued that “all the people in 1999 were kind of right.”",

      "description": "The court refused to strike down the entire law saying \"the grant of stay is only in the rarest of rare category\".",
      "content": "India's top court suspends parts of contentious Muslim property law\n\nThe court was hearing a bunch of petitions that challenged the law\n\nSuch properties - worth billions of dollars - are important to India's 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages - and cannot be sold for any other purpose.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community.\n\nThe court was hearing pleas by Muslim groups and opposition parties who argue the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 infringes on the rights of Muslims. The government says it will make managing the properties more transparent.\n\nIndia's Supreme Court has suspended key provisions of a controversial new law that changes how properties donated by Muslims are owned and managed in the country.\n\nHistorically, these properties have been governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level waqf boards to manage them.\n\nBut in April, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government amended the act, including changes to how a waqf property is determined and managed, sparking criticism from the community.\n\nOn Monday, a bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih refused to strike down the entire law saying that \"the grant of stay is only in the rarest of rare category\".\n\nIt did, however, halt a controversial provision which allowed the government to decide whether a disputed property is waqf or not.\n\nOver the years, many properties that were donated through oral declarations or community customs have been legitimised as waqf properties because of their continuous use by the Muslim community.\n\nBut under the new law, waqf boards were required to provide valid documents to claim a property as waqf. In case of disputes, the final decision rested with the government.\n\nThe court struck down the rule, saying that allowing the government to determine the rights of a citizen would go against the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary, mandated under the constitution.\n\nAnother contentious provision that was scrapped was a clause that required a waqf donor to be a practising Muslim for at least five years.\n\nThe waqf properties are currently managed by state-level boards and a central council, with nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of state bar council, Islamic scholars and the managers of these properties.\n\nWhile the judges refused to stay a provision that allows the nomination of non-Muslims to the waqf board, they limited the number of non-Muslim members to four in the 22-member federal board and to three in the 11-member state boards.\n\nThe court also said that \"efforts should be made to appoint the chief executive officer of the board from amongst the Muslim community\".\n\nThe case reached the top court in early April, soon after the law was passed by parliament amid widespread criticism from Muslim groups and opposition parties.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

      "content": "pgstream - Postgres replication with DDL changes\n\npgstream is an open source CDC command-line tool and library that offers Postgres replication support with DDL changes to any provided target.\n\nFeatures\n\nSchema change tracking and replication of DDL changes\n\nSupport for multiple out of the box targets Elasticsearch/OpenSearch Webhooks PostgreSQL\n\nInitial and on demand PostgreSQL snapshots (for when you don't need continuous replication)\n\nColumn value transformations (anonymise your data on the go!)\n\nModular deployment configuration, only requires Postgres\n\nKafka support with schema based partitioning\n\nExtendable support for custom targets\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUsage\n\npgstream can be used via the readily available CLI or as a library. For detailed information about the CLI usage, check out the dedicated CLI documentation section.\n\nCLI Installation\n\nBinaries\n\nBinaries are available for Linux, macOS & Windows, check our Releases.\n\nFrom source\n\nTo install pgstream from the source, run the following command:\n\ngo install github.com/xataio/pgstream@latest\n\nFrom package manager - Homebrew\n\nTo install pgstream with homebrew, run the following command:\n\n# macOS or Linux brew tap xataio/pgstream brew install pgstream\n\nEnvironment setup\n\nIf you have an environment available, with at least Postgres and whichever module resources you're planning on running, then you can skip this step. Otherwise, a docker setup is available in this repository that starts Postgres, Kafka and OpenSearch (as well as OpenSearch dashboards for easy visualisation).\n\ndocker-compose -f build/docker/docker-compose.yml up\n\nThe docker-compose file has profiles that can be used in order to bring up only the relevant containers. If for example you only want to run PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL pgstream replication you can use the pg2pg profile as follows:\n\ndocker-compose -f build/docker/docker-compose.yml --profile pg2pg up\n\nYou can also run multiple profiles. For example to start two PostgreSQL instances and Kafka:\n\ndocker-compose -f build/docker/docker-compose.yml --profile pg2pg --profile kafka up\n\nList of supported docker profiles:\n\npg2pg\n\npg2os\n\npg2webhook\n\nkafka\n\nConfiguration\n\nPgstream source and target need to be configured appropriately before the commands can be run. This can be done:\n\nUsing the relevant CLI flags for each command\n\nUsing a yaml configuration file\n\nUsing environment variables (.env file supported)\n\nCheck the documentation for more information about the configuration options, or check the help on the CLI for details on the available flags. Additionally, at the root of this repository you can find sample files for both .env and .yaml.\n\nIf you want to configure column transformations, leveraging greenmask, neosync and go-masker open source integrations, as well as custom transformers, check the transformation rules configuration for more details, along with the list of available transformers.\n\nPrepare the database\n\nThis will create the pgstream schema in the configured Postgres database, along with the tables/functions/triggers required to keep track of the schema changes. See Tracking schema changes section for more details. It will also create a replication slot for the configured database which will be used by the pgstream service. If no replication slot name is provided, it will use a default one with the format pgstream_<database>_slot . This step can be skipped and --init can be provided as an option to run command. It will do the same preparation right before starting the replication.\n\n# with CLI flags pgstream init --postgres-url \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost?sslmode=disable \" --replication-slot test # with yaml configuration file pgstream init -c pg2pg.yaml # with environment configuration file pgstream init -c pg2pg.env\n\nThe status of the initalisation and the configuration can be checked by using the status command.\n\npgstream status -c pg2pg.yaml SUCCESS pgstream status check encountered no issues Initialisation status: - Pgstream schema exists: true - Pgstream schema_log table exists: true - Migration current version: 7 - Migration status: success - Replication slot name: pgstream_postgres_slot - Replication slot plugin: wal2json - Replication slot database: postgres Config status: - Valid: true Transformation rules status: - Valid: true Source status: - Reachable: true\n\nIf there are any issues or if you want to revert the pgstream setup, you can use the destroy command to clean up all pgstream state.\n\npgstream destroy --postgres-url \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost?sslmode=disable \" --replication-slot test # with yaml configuration file pgstream destroy -c pg2pg.yaml # with environment configuration file pgstream destroy -c pg2pg.env\n\nRun pgstream\n\nReplication mode\n\nRun will start streaming data from the configured source into the configured target.\n\nExample running pgstream replication from Postgres -> OpenSearch:\n\n# using the environment configuration file pgstream run -c pg2os.env --log-level trace # using the yaml configuration file pgstream run -c pg2os.yaml --log-level info # using the CLI flags pgstream run --source postgres --source-url \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable \" --target opensearch --target-url \" http://admin:admin@localhost:9200 \"\n\nExample running pgstream with Postgres -> Kafka, and in a separate terminal, Kafka->OpenSearch:\n\n# using the environment configuration file pgstream run -c pg2kafka.env --log-level trace # using the yaml configuration file pgstream run -c pg2kafka.yaml --log-level info # using the CLI flags pgstream run --source postgres --source-url \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable \" --target kafka --target-url \" localhost:9092 \"\n\n# using the environment configuration file pgstream run -c kafka2os.env --log-level trace # using the yaml configuration file pgstream run -c kafka2os.yaml --log-level info # using the CLI flags pgstream run --source kafka --source-url \" localhost:9092 \" --target opensearch --target-url \" http://admin:admin@localhost:9200 \"\n\nExample running pgstream with PostgreSQL -> PostgreSQL with initial snapshot enabled:\n\n# using the environment configuration file pgstream run -c pg2pg.env --log-level trace # using the yaml configuration file pgstream run -c pg2pg.yaml --log-level info # using the CLI flags pgstream run --source postgres --source-url \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable \" --target postgres --target-url \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:7654?sslmode=disable \" --snapshot-tables test\n\nSnapshot mode\n\nExample running pgstream to perform a snapshot from PostgreSQL -> PostgreSQL:\n\n# using the environment configuration file pgstream snapshot -c snapshot2pg.env --log-level trace # using the yaml configuration file pgstream snapshot -c snapshot2pg.yaml --log-level info # using the CLI flags pgstream snapshot --postgres-url= \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432?sslmode=disable \" --target=postgres --target-url= \" postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:7654?sslmode=disable \" --tables= \" test \" --reset\n\nPgstream will parse the configuration provided, and initialise the relevant modules. It requires at least one source(listener) and one target(processor).\n\nTutorials\n\nDocumentation\n\nFor more advanced usage, implementation details, and detailed configuration settings, please refer to the full documentation below.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nSnapshots\n\nDatasets used: IMDB database, MusicBrainz database, Firenibble database.\n\nAll benchmarks were run using the same setup, with pgstream v0.7.2 , pg_dump/pg_restore (PostgreSQL) 17.4 and PostgreSQL 17.4, using identical resources to ensure a fair comparison.\n\nFor more details into performance benchmarking for snapshots to PostgreSQL with pgstream , check out this blogpost.\n\nLimitations\n\nSome of the limitations of the initial release include:\n\nSingle Kafka topic support\n\nPostgres plugin support limited to wal2json\n\nNo row level filtering support\n\nPrimary key/unique not null column required for replication\n\nKafka serialisation support limited to JSON\n\nContributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community!

      "description": "\"When residents of Equatorial Guinea's Annob&oacute;n island wrote to the government in Malabo in July last year complaining about the dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company, they didn't expect the swift end to their internet access...\" reports the Associated Press. \n\n\"Residents and activists said the company's dynamite explosions in open quarries and construction activities have been polluting their farmlands and water supply...\"\n\nDozens of the signatories and residents were imprisoned for nearly a year, while internet access to the small island has been cut off since then, according to several residents and rights groups. Local residents interviewed by The Associated Press left the island in the past months, citing fear for their lives and the difficulty of life without internet.

      "content": "A former Meta product manager has claimed that the social network circumvented Apple’s privacy protections, as well as cheating advertisers, and fired him when he repeatedly raised the issue internally.\n\nMeta is said to have found ways to identify Apple users even after they refused consent for app tracking, in order to avoid an estimated $10 billion loss of revenue …\n\nApp Tracking Transparency hit Meta hard\n\nMeta relied heavily on selling personalized advertising, which required it to be able to target particular demographics and interest groups. This was achieved by tracking individual users across different apps.\n\nApple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) was introduced in 2021 and meant that companies required user permission in order to carry out this tracking. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of users declined.\n\nIt was estimated at the time that this would cost social media companies many billions of dollars, and Meta’s CFO warned investors that its own loss would be around $10B per year\n\nMeta accused of bypassing protections\n\nIt was quickly alleged that Meta was using workarounds to continue to track users who had denied permission, alongside other privacy violations. A class action lawsuit followed.\n\nA fired product manager at the company, Samujjal Purkayastha, has now taken his case to an employment tribunal claiming he was unlawfully dismissed for raising concerns about the practice, reports the Financial Times.\n\nMeta secretly linked user data with other information to track users’ activity on other websites without their permission — despite Apple in 2021 introducing measures explicitly requiring consent, according to Purkayastha’s filings […] A “closed and secretive” team at Meta is alleged to have used “deterministic matching” — gathering identifiable information that could then be used to connect data across multiple platforms in violation of Apple’s new privacy policies.\n\nHe also accuses Meta of inflating the value of sales achieved by advertising on its platforms.\n\nMeta denies any wrongdoing, and claims that Purkayastha was dismissed for unrelated reasons. The tribunal was unable to rule immediately, and said a full hearing will be held later in the year.\n\nHighlighted accessories\n\nPhoto by Mario Heller on Unsplash",

      "content": "Six people have been shot dead in two days in a crime-plagued area of Cape Town, adding to the death toll in a city already reeling from the scourge of gang-related violence.\n\nAt 11.30pm on Monday, two women, aged 19 and 25, were killed and a 24-year-old woman injured in a shooting in Wallacedene, an informal settlement on Cape Town’s north-eastern edge, South African police said. About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked.\n\nThe suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal.\n\nOn 5 September, a man was shot dead at a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, the third killing in a Cape Town court since April.\n\nCape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according to data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz, a Mexican NGO.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according to city authorities, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950.\n\n“Our communities are fearful,” Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. “We don’t have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.”\n\nWestern Cape police said last week they were carrying out “targeted operations” in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: “The message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.”\n\nThe acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for “intelligence-driven operations” to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime, local media reported.\n\n“There is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,” said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance.\n\nMore than 26,000 people were murdered in South Africa last year, South African police data shows. Almost 3,500 of those were in Cape Town, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz.",
