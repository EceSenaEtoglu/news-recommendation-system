      "title": "Here are five fintechs that could be next to IPO after Klarna",
      "description": "Klarna's bumper IPO has got investors wondering about which fintech names could be next to go public.",
      "content": "In this article KLAR Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nSpecialist traders work at the post for Swedish fintech Klarna, during the company’s IPO at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Sept. 10, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nAfter Swedish payments group Klarna's $17 billion initial public offering, investors are pondering which big fintech name will be the next to go public. Klarna popped as much as 30% on the day of its New York IPO, before settling to close around 15% higher. The stock declined further to $42.92 by Friday but is still up about 7% from its IPO price of $40. The debut demonstrated how Wall Street is becoming more welcoming of bumper fintech listings. Prior to Klarna, online trading platform eToro, stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish all went public to a positive first-day reception. Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, surged 14% in its IPO Friday. \"I think the Klarna IPO would be viewed positively by some of the other scaled-up vendors,\" Gautam Pillai, head of fintech research at British investment bank Peel Hunt, told CNBC. There's a crowded pipeline of fintech names that could be next to IPO after Klarna. CNBC looks at which companies look the most promising.\n\nStripe\n\nPatrick Collison, chief executive officer and co-founder of Stripe Inc., left, smiles as John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Studio 1.0 television interview in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Friday, March 23, 2018. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDigital payments firm Stripe has for years been viewed as an IPO contender. Stripe has remained a private company in the 15 years since it was founded, and founders and brothers John and Patrick Collison have long resisted pressure to take the business public. However, that doesn't mean a stock market listing hasn't been on Stripe's mind. The Collisons told employees in 2023 that Stripe would decide to either go public or allow employees to sell shares via a secondary offering within the next year. Ultimately, Stripe in January opted for a secondary share sale valuing the company at $91.5 billion — close to its peak valuation of $95 billion, which it achieved in 2021. That doesn't mean Stripe couldn't still pursue a stock market debut further down the line. Many fintech unicorn CEOs have been keeping a close eye on Klarna's IPO performance for signs of when will be the right moment to list.\n\nRevolut\n\nRevolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, Nov. 7, 2019. Pedro Nunes | Reuters\n\nRevolut is widely seen as a potential future fintech IPO candidate. The digital banking unicorn told CNBC last week that it recently gave employees the chance to sell shares on the secondary market at a whopping $75 billion valuation, placing it above some major U.K. banks by market value. \"As part of our commitment to our employees, we regularly provide opportunities for them to gain liquidity,\" a Revolut spokesperson told CNBC at the time. \"An employee secondary share sale is currently in process, and we won't be commenting further until it is complete.\" The secondary round buys Revolut some time to remain private for longer while still offering staff the chance to exit some of their holdings. At the same time, though, it now makes Revolut one of the world's most valuable private fintech firms. As to where Revolut lists, for now the U.S. appears the likeliest location. Co-founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky has spoken candidly about his preference to list in the U.S. due to issues with London's IPO market. Last year, he told the 20VC podcast that it was \"just not rational\" to go public in the U.K.\n\nMonzo\n\nMonzo CEO TS Anil. Monzo\n\nHaving recently reached a $5.9 billion valuation in a secondary share sale, British digital bank Monzo is another contender for the public markets. A report surfaced earlier this year from Sky News that said Monzo had lined up bankers to work on an IPO that could take place as early as the first half of 2026. However, in a fireside discussion moderated by CNBC at SXSW London, Monzo CEO TS Anil said that an IPO is \"not the thing we're focused on right now\" — it's worth noting though that this was back in June. \"The thing we're focused on is scale the business, continue to grow it, double it again, reach more customers, build more products, continue to drive great economic outcomes on the back of that,\" Anil said at the time. Anil wouldn't comment on where Monzo would list if it were to IPO, but he stressed the firm was \"deeply committed\" to being globally headquartered in London.\n\nStarling Bank\n\nRaman Bhatia, incoming chief executive officer of Starling. Bhatia moved over from OVO Energy Ltd., where he was CEO. Zed Jameson | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMonzo's rival neobank Starling Bank has reportedly been considering an initial public offering in the U.S. as part of expansion plans there. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Starling had hired Jody Bhagat, former president of global banking at software firm Personetics Technologies, to lead the growth of its Engine technology unit in the U.S. Starling declined to comment when asked by CNBC about its listing plans. Last year, Starling's CEO Raman Bhatia talked up the bank's plans to expand globally via Engine, a software platform that Starling sells to other companies so they can set up their own digital banks. \"I am very bullish about this approach around internationalization of what is the best of Starling — the proprietary tech,\" Bhatia said during a fireside chat at the Money 20/20 conference moderated by CNBC. Starling was last privately valued at £2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in a 2022 funding round. However, reports indicate the firm is looking to fetch a valuation of £4 billion in an upcoming secondary share sale.\n\nPayhawk\n\nSaravutvanset | Room | Getty Images\n\nThough a lesser known name, Bulgaria-founded fintech firm Payhawk also has IPO ambitions. The spend management platform was valued at $1 billion in 2022 and saw revenue surge 85% year-over-year in 2024 to 23.4 million euros ($27.4 million). \"We're definitely seeing the IPO window open,\" Payhawk CEO and co-founder Hristo Borisov told CNBC in an interview earlier this month. However, he stressed that \"we are looking at more of a five-year horizon there.\" \"If you look at the majority of the IPOs, the majority of those IPOs are companies with $400 million to $500 million-plus ARR [annual recurring revenue],\" Borisov said. \"That's our goal.\"\n\nSome honorary mentions",

      "title": "'If We Want Bigger Wind Turbines, We're Gonna Need Bigger Airplanes'",
      "description": "Long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 shared this article from IEEE Spectrum:\n\nThe world's largest airplane, when it's built, will stretch more than a football field from tip to tail. Sixty percent longer than the biggest existing aircraft, with 12 times as much cargo space as a 747, the behemoth will look like an oil tanker that's sprouted wings &mdash; aeronautical engineering at a preposterous scale. \n\nCalled WindRunner, and expected by 2030, it'll haul just one thing: massive wind-turbine blades. In most parts of the world, onshore wind-turbine blades can be built to a length of 70 meters, max. This size constraint comes not from the limits of blade engineering or physics; it's transportation. Any larger and the blades couldn't be moved over land, since they wouldn't fit through tunnels or overpasses, or be able to accommodate some of the sharper curves of roads and rails. \n\nSo the WindRunner's developer, Radia of Boulder, Colorado, has staked its business model on the idea that the only way to get extralarge blades to wind farms is to fly them there... Radia's plane will be able to hold two 95-meter blades or one 105-meter blade, and land on makeshift dirt runways adjacent to wind farms. This may sound audacious &mdash; an act of hubris undertaken for its own sake. But Radia's supporters argue that WindRunner is simply the right tool for the job &mdash; the only way to make onshore wind turbines bigger. Bigger turbines, after all, can generate more energy at a lower cost per megawatt. But the question is: Will supersizing airplanes be worth the trouble...? \n\nHaving fewer total turbines means a wind farm could space them farther apart, avoiding airflow interference. The turbines would be nearly twice as tall, so they'll reach a higher, gustier part of the atmosphere. And big turbines don't need to spin as quickly, so they would make economic sense in places with average wind speeds around 5 meters per second compared with the roughly 7 m/s needed to sustain smaller units. \"The result...is more than a doubling of the acres in the world where wind is viable,\" says Mark Lundstrom [Radia's founder and CEO]. \n\nThe executive director at America's National Renewable Energy Laboratory Foundation points out that one day blades could just be 3D-printed on-site &mdash; negating the need for the airplane altogether. But 3D printing for turbines is still in its earliest stages.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status='If+We+Want+Bigger+Wind+Turbines%2C+We're+Gonna+Need+Bigger+Airplanes'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0224231%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F15%2F0224231%2Fif-we-want-bigger-wind-turbines-were-gonna-need-bigger-airplanes%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/09/15/0224231/if-we-want-bigger-wind-turbines-were-gonna-need-bigger-airplanes?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "America's Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Amazon and Google misled advertisers placing ads on their websites, reports Bloomberg, and specifically whether the two companies \"properly disclosed the terms and pricing for ads.\"\n\nThe FTC is seeking details about Amazon's auctions and whether it disclosed \"reserve pricing\" for some search ads &mdash; price floors that advertisers must meet before they can buy an ad, the people said. Separately, the FTC is examining practices by Google, including its internal pricing process and whether it increased the cost of ads in ways that weren't disclosed to advertisers, the people said... \n\nAccording to one of the people, the FTC's latest investigation emerged from its earlier antitrust case. In that complaint, the agency alleges that Amazon litters its marketplace with irrelevant results for search queries, making it harder for shoppers to find what they are looking for and more expensive for sellers to use the platform. The practice effectively forces sellers to buy ads to make their product appear in response to consumer searches.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=America's+FTC+Opens+New+Probe+into+Amazon+and+Google+Advertising+Practices%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F1638247%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F1638247%2Famericas-ftc-opens-new-probe-into-amazon-and-google-advertising-practices%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/09/14/1638247/americas-ftc-opens-new-probe-into-amazon-and-google-advertising-practices?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "title": "The Next Era of Gene Editing Will Be Disease Agnostic",
      "description": "At the WIRED Health summit, pioneer David Liu said his lab is on the verge of revealing a new gene-editing technique that could target multiple unrelated diseases.",
      "content": "At the WIRED Health summit last week, Harvard biochemist and gene-editing pioneer David Liu says later this year his lab plans to report on a single gene-editing strategy that could treat many unrelated diseases. He calls it disease-agnostic therapeutic gene editing.\n\n“It sounds sort of crazy, but there’s actually a very good molecular biology reason why this could be possible,” he told the audience in Boston, stopping short of details.\n\nGene-editing treatments are currently being developed for several rare and inherited genetic diseases. One gene-editing treatment, called Casgevy, is approved and available commercially to treat sickle cell disease and a related blood disorder called beta thalassemia. Earlier this year, KJ Muldoon, a baby boy born with an often fatal genetic disease that causes ammonia to build up in his blood, was saved with a customized gene-editing treatment—a medical first.\n\nThese treatments work by targeting specific mutations related to those diseases. But they can be costly to develop and must be designed for specific patient populations. Sometimes those patient populations can be very small, as in the case of baby KJ. His condition, called CPS1 deficiency, affects just one in 1.3 million live births.\n\nLiu envisions a future in which one gene-editing approach could be used on multiple different diseases, regardless of what organ or tissue they affect or their genetic cause. He says this kind of streamlined strategy is needed because collectively, there are so many rare diseases, and it would be impractical to design treatments for each one. Global Genes, a rare disease advocacy organization, estimates that there are at least 10,000 rare diseases that affect more than 400 million people worldwide.\n\nPHOTOGRAPH: VAIL FUCCI\n\n“Genetic disease as a whole is not so rare. It’s actually many times more prevalent than cancer or HIV/AIDS,” Liu said. “We urgently need these ways to directly treat the root cause of these genetic diseases.”",

      "content": "South Korea’s government has said it will launch an investigation into whether human rights violations were committed when hundreds of its citizens were detained in a US immigration raid.\n\nAbout 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals, were arrested at the construction site of an electric vehicle battery factory in the US state of Georgia on 4 September.\n\nThe raid was the largest single-site operation conducted since the US president, Donald Trump, launched a sweeping immigration crackdown. Images of the workers chained and handcuffed shocked South Korea, prompting a stern rebuke from Seoul.\n\nAfter delicate diplomatic negotiations, the detained South Korean workers were released and flown back to Seoul. Some of the workers told local media about appalling conditions during their arrest, including allegations they were held without being informed of their rights.\n\nWhen asked about those allegations, the presidential office in Seoul said it was conducting a “thorough review”.\n\n“Both our side and the US are checking if there were any shortcomings in the measures taken and companies are also looking into it,” the presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung told a press briefing. “Together with the company concerned, we are conducting a more thorough review into possible human rights infringements.”\n\nOne of the workers told Yonhap News Agency that their rights were not read when they were arrested. The worker also told the agency they were angry that Ice agents mocked them with remarks about “North Korea” and “rocket man” – an insult Trump has previously used about Pyongyang’s leader, Kim Jong-un.\n\nSouth Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, called the raid “bewildering” and noted it could have a chilling effect on future investment. South Korean companies “can’t help but question whether setting up a plant in the US is worth the potential risks”, Lee said.\n\nIn what seemed to be a response, Trump said on Sunday that foreign workers were “welcome” and he did not want to scare investors.\n\n“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize investment,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.",

      "description": "Last year Amazon's robotaxi service Zoox held a training session for 20 Las Vegas firefighters, police officers, and other first responders, reports the Washington Post, calling it \"a new ritual for emergency workers across the country, as autonomous vehicles begin to spread beyond the handful of cities that served as initial testing grounds...\"\n Questions that came up included: What can first responders do if the nearly 6,000-pound vehicle is blocking a roadway? (Better to pull, not push.) What happens if the vehicle loses its connectivity? (It's designed to pull over.) And can first responders manually shut off the vehicle? (Not yet, but Zoox is working on it....) The vehicles' operators claim they drive more safely than humans, but anything can happen on public roads, and first responders need to know how to intervene if a robotaxi is caught in a collision that traps passengers, catches fire or gets caught doing something that demands a traffic stop... \n\nAlphabet's Waymo, which has more than 2,000 vehicles completing hundreds of thousands of paid trips each week across San Francisco and Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta, has trained more than 20,000 first responders in how to interact with its vehicles, the company said. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on how many first responders the company has trained, but a representative from the Austin Police Department confirmed that fire, police and transit workers were trained on the company's Robotaxi before the company launched commercial service in June. Tesla, Waymo and Zoox say their vehicles can detect the lights and sirens of emergency vehicles and automatically attempt to pull over. Waymo says its vehicles can interpret first responders' hand signals.... \n\nThe first responders appeared excited about the potential of the company's artificial intelligence technology to ferry visitors up and down the Vegas Strip without concern that a driver might be inebriated. They were also wary of problems that might unfold: Autonomous vehicles are electric, and when electric vehicles catch fire, they're difficult to extinguish, the firefighters said. The first responders also worried that a secondary air bag deployment could injure an emergency responder, a common concern with conventional vehicles. And if a police officer wanted to view the footage a Zoox vehicle captured on the road, would the company be willing to share it? \n\nTurning over footage would require a subpoena, a Zoox official responded. \n\nBut \"those who've been through the trainings and have seen large-scale commercial rollouts say it's difficult to anticipate all the potential issues in a specific market,\" the article points out.\n\nDarius Luttropp, former deputy chief of operations for the San Francisco Fire Department, told the Post last year that Waymo vehicles had blocked city firefighters from leaving and entering firehouses, and also crashed into their equipment.\nLt.

      "description": "TechCrunch reports:\n\nThanks to a pledge to unbundle its corporate messaging app Teams from its productivity suites, Microsoft has managed to slip unscathed through a major antitrust investigation by the European Commission that could have resulted in massive fines for the tech giant. \n\nThe Commission on Friday okayed Microsoft's concessions to address the EU's competition concerns over the company including Teams along with the rest of its Office productivity suite for free, concluding a multi-year investigation that was sparked by complaints from rival office messaging app Slack in 2020. Microsoft has promised that for the next seven years, it will provide Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams at a lower price and will let customers choose whether they want to pay more to add the collaboration app to the suites... \nMicrosoft is voluntarily offering some versions of both its productivity suites without Teams at a 50% lower price compared to versions that bundle the app, worldwide. And Microsoft dodged punitive measures and a big fine, as the Commission's penalties for breaching competition rules can reach up to 10% of annual global revenue &mdash; which, considering the tech giant last year recorded $245 billion in revenue, would have been truckloads of money. \nThe article adds one more interesting detail. \"The Commission has also managed to get Microsoft to agree to open up its APIs to enable interoperability for key features between its suite and third-party messaging and collaboration tools, as well as let them export their data out of teams for the next five years...\" The Commission's official announcement says this will \"open up the market for other providers of communication and collaboration tools in Europe.\" \n\nAnd Microsoft will also allow customers with long-term licenses the option of switching to a suite switch without Teams...<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Escapes+EU+Competition+Probe+by+Unbundling+Teams+for+Seven+Years%2C+Opening+API%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F0433205%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F0433205%2Fmicrosoft-escapes-eu-competition-probe-by-unbundling-teams-for-seven-years-opening-api%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/25/09/14/0433205/microsoft-escapes-eu-competition-probe-by-unbundling-teams-for-seven-years-opening-api?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "title": "Via raises $492.9M in IPO, and German automakers go on the offensive",
      "description": "Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation.",
      "content": "Welcome back! Did you miss me? Yes, of course you did. There is a lot of “future of transportation” news to keep track of. Let’s jump in.\n\nIt’s comeback week, and not just because I have returned from vacation. I’m talking about the biennial IAA Mobility conference in Munich and the purposeful effort among German automakers to show the world it can still offer compelling, technologically advanced, and affordable vehicles. The subtext of the splashy event that started Tuesday: “Hey, China, we’re not out of the race.”\n\nVW Group, Mercedes, and BMW all showcased numerous new vehicles, including electric ones. And executives made their battle cries: VW Group Oliver Blume struck a bullish tone in a few interviews with reporters and laid out the company’s plan to be competitive in China, particularly with EVs, a category where VW has lagged.\n\nBut what about on the home front? Chinese automakers have been pushing into Europe, and consumers have responded. The German automakers are hoping their latest products — including a new all-electric Mercedes GLC, the BMW iX3 with its four “superbrain” computers, and the Volkswagen ID Polo and ID Cross concept — will preserve and even grow market share. But they have some work to do. Chinese companies like BYD almost doubled their market share in Europe over the past year, JATO Dynamics reported in July.\n\nOne other IAA news item of note: Rimac Technology, the tech and parts unit of Rimac Group, has developed solid-state battery packs it says will be available by late 2027. These batteries apparently pack in the energy and can be charged from 10% to 80% in under 10 minutes.\n\nTo get TechCrunch Mobility in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility!\n\nA little bird\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\n\nHyundai appears to still be committed to Motional, according to two little birds who have shared new investment information with me.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nHyundai and Aptiv had created a joint venture (called Motional) with an agreement to invest $4 billion in the effort. Aptiv backed out in early 2024, leaving Hyundai to either invest its own money, find other outside partners, or shutter the program altogether. Hyundai opted to invest $1 billion — $475 million directly into Motional as part of a broader deal that includes buying out joint venture partner Aptiv. Hyundai agreed to spend another $448 million to buy 11% of Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional.\n\nNow it appears Hyundai is investing more into Motional in two tranches. The first is being dispersed this year and is about $452 million. The second comes next year, and I’m still trying to nail down that amount. That first figure is in line with reporting from a Korean outlet. Hyundai declined (a couple of times!) to respond to my questions about the funding. That’s pretty typical for large corporations to stay mum. However, one little bird who is deep within the AV industry also noted that Hyundai might not want to make a big deal about this, considering it’s also working with Waymo.\n\nIn other little bird chirpings, there are two new hires at General Motors that you might find interesting. Sony Mohapatra, the former senior manager of AI compute platforms at Cruise, has landed as director of AI and machine learning engineering at General Motors. And Paul Menson, who was the senior staff account manager of Megapack at Tesla, is now director of energy storage systems business development at General Motors.\n\nGot a tip for us?

The company, as I have mentioned before, has been batting around plans for an IPO for years.\n\nEarlier this year, it filed confidentially for an IPO — the second time it took this step. But this time, Via took the big IPO leap. The company, which is known for its Citymapper mobile navigation app, said it sold 10.7 million shares for $46 per share. In all, Via raised $492.9 million at a $3.7 billion valuation. That’s just slightly above its $3.5 billion valuation that it garnered back in 2023 during its last venture raise.\n\nWe had to wrap up this newsletter before it officially began trading, but I’ll be back next week with an update.\n\nOther deals that got my attention …\n\nArc Boats, the Los Angeles startup founded in 2021 by former SpaceX employees, signed a $160 million contract with Curtin Maritime for new hybrid-electric tugs, which are expected to hit the waters around the Los Angeles port in 2027.\n\nLeydenJar, the Netherlands-based battery materials startup, raised €13 million ($15.2 million) in a round led by Extantia and Invest-NL.\n\nStandard Fleet, a fleet management software company, raised $13 million in a Series A round led by Nova Threshold with participation from WEX Venture Capital, SNR, Garry Tan (CEO of Y Combinator), Salil Deshpande (Uncorrelated Ventures), and Apoorv Bhargava (WeaveGrid). Returning investors included Burst Capital, Canvas Ventures, Liquid 2, Night Capital, Olive Capital, UP2398, and Danny Wen.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration announced a new pilot program that will let electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startups test some operations before they receive full regulatory certification.\n\nHyundai’s once-buzzy electric air taxi startup Supernal is having trouble getting off the ground. The company paused work on its aircraft program after a rocky few months that saw staff cuts and the departure of its CEO and CTO, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\n\nInDrive, the Mountain View-based startup that got its start in Siberia and is known for its bidding-based ride-hailing model across Asia and Latin America, wants to be a global super app. Here’s what and where it’s targeting.\n\nJaguar Land Rover said a cyberattack brought vehicle assembly lines to a standstill.\n\nLyft and May Mobility have launched a robotaxi service in Atlanta, the first commercial deployment in the two companies’ partnership.\n\nNevada’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration opened an investigation after a Boring Company employee sustained a “crushing injury” working on one of its tunnels in Las Vegas. Work has stopped at the site.\n\nTesla has the proper permit to begin testing autonomous vehicle technology on public roads in Nevada. As I explain in this article, securing a testing permit in the state is straightforward and easy. (Just fill out the registry form, and make sure you have the proper $5 million insurance coverage.) Tesla will still need to complete the self-certification process to be able to roll out an entire program. And it will need separate approval to operate a commercial ride-hailing service.\n\nUber and Chinese autonomous vehicle startup Momenta plan to start testing robotaxis in Munich starting in 2026.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing company of violating federal law by discriminating against people with physical disabilities.\n\nOne more thing …\n\nTechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is right around the corner — in around six weeks or so. And we have some high-profile folks from the transportation world coming onto our stage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.

      "description": "Young Ugandan women tell BBC they are being lured to Dubai to take part in extreme sex acts.",
      "content": "Boss of degrading sex-trade ring in Dubai's glamour districts unmasked by BBC\n\n14 hours ago Share Save Runako Celina BBC Eye Investigations Share Save\n\nWatch: Charles Mwesigwa - known locally as Abbey - says his women are \"open-minded\"\n\nWarning: Contains disturbing content and graphic descriptions of sexual acts A man running a sex ring operating out of Dubai's most glamorous neighbourhoods, and exploiting vulnerable women, has been identified by a BBC investigation. Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to. Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.\n\nOutside of the UK you can watch on YouTube\n\nOne of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.\n\nFamily handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda\n\nMia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.\n\nWarsan Tower in Dubai, from which Monic Karungi fell in May 2022\n\nFinding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.\n\nMr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver\n\n\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\". When asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. \"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run.\n\nTroy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa\n\nHe says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. \"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. \"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022.\n\nInstagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died\n\nMonic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. \"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation.\n\nInstagram Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan, also died after falling from a Dubai high-rise building\n\nKayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. \"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us.\n\nMonic's family in rural Uganda say Monic always had the ambition to seek a better life",

      "description": "The UK's data-protecting Information Commissioner's Office has issued a warning about what it calls a worrying trend, reports the BBC: \"students hacking their own school and college IT systems for fun or as part of dares.\"\n\n\n\nSince 2022, the the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has investigated 215 hacks and breaches originating from inside education settings and says 57% were carried out by children. Other breaches are thought to come from staff, third party IT suppliers and other organisations with access. According to the new data, almost a third of the breaches involved students illegally logging into staff computer systems by guessing passwords or stealing details from teachers. \n\nIn one incident, a seven-year-old was involved in a data breach and subsequently referred to the National Crime Agency's Cyber Choices programme to help them understand the seriousness of their actions... In another incident three Year 11 students aged 15 or 16 unlawfully accessed school databases containing the personal information of more than 1,400 students. The pupils used hacking tools downloaded from the internet to break passwords and security protocols.

      "content": "US and Chinese officials to meet for second day in Spain as Trump threatens to target China’s oil purchases.\n\nThe United States and China are set to hold a second day of trade talks in Spain amid efforts to de-escalate tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nUS and Chinese officials will meet at the Santa Cruz Palace in Madrid on Monday in their latest bid to reach a comprehensive trade deal after months of tit-for-tat trade salvoes between the sides.\n\nOfficials, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, held about six hours of talks on Sunday.\n\nThe talks, which are scheduled to run until Wednesday, come as relations between Washington and Beijing continue to be roiled by differences on trade, including China’s purchase of Russian oil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has been pushing US allies to impose steep tariffs on China and India over their purchases of Russian oil in a bid to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn a social media post over the weekend, Trump said NATO countries should impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on Chinese goods until the war is brought to an end.\n\n“China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump has already raised the tariff rate on Indian goods to 50 percent to push New Delhi away from Moscow, but he has so far not targeted China over its oil purchases.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday appeared to hit out at Washington’s efforts to punish countries buying Russian oil, saying sanctions would only “complicate” the situation in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWang’s comments came as China’s Ministry of Commerce launched two new investigations of the US chip sector, a day after the US Department of Commerce added 23 more Chinese entities to its restricted trade list.\n\nThe talks in Spain also come in advance of a Wednesday deadline for Chinese company ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban on the video-sharing app in the US.\n\nTrump has on three occasions delayed the enforcement of the ban, which was included in legislation passed by the US Congress last year with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n\nUS and Chinese officials last met in July in Stockholm, Sweden, following talks in London and Geneva, Switzerland, in May and June, respectively.\n\nAt their most recent meeting, the sides agreed to extend an earlier pause on tariffs of up to 145 percent for another 90 days.\n\nUnder the truce, the US has been charging a 30 percent duty on Chinese goods, while US goods are subject to a 10 percent levy.\n\nHeiwai Tang, director of the Asia Global Institute in Hong Kong, said neither Washington nor Beijing currently have much incentive to fully back down from the trade war.\n\n“China has rare earth and the manufacturing capacity that the US needs, while the US has the market that China can’t easily replace with another one. So both have some bargaining power against each other,” Tang told Al Jazeera.\n\nTang said he expects Trump to lower tariffs at some point as rising prices became more of an issue in the US.\n\n“The question is when,” he said.\n\n“Economists are not good at predicting the exact timing of events. If you ask me, it will be very likely that both sides will lower tariffs on each other in less than a year’s time.”\n\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, said she has modest expectations for the talks.\n\n“If they can bundle something together, I would think they will try to promise to resolve TikTok by the end of Trump’s term. Extending the deadline for less than that just leads to new deadlines which are also likely to be problematic,” Elms told Al Jazeera.\n\nA key agenda item of the talks, Elms said, is likely to be a long-mooted summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, possibly on the sidelines of October’s APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“I think there is a strong interest in getting Trump and Xi together in a matter of weeks,” she said.\n\n“That is likely to be high on the agenda for both sides.”",

      "content": "In a recent 3Blue1Brown video series on transformer models, Grant Sanderson posed a fascinating question: How can a relatively modest embedding space of 12,288 dimensions (GPT-3) accommodate millions of distinct real-world concepts?\n\nThe answer lies at the intersection of high-dimensional geometry and a remarkable mathematical result known as the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. While exploring this question, I discovered something unexpected that led to an interesting collaboration with Grant and a deeper understanding of vector space geometry.\n\nThe key insight begins with a simple observation: while an N-dimensional space can only hold N perfectly orthogonal vectors, relaxing this constraint to allow for \"quasi-orthogonal\" relationships (vectors at angles of, say, 85-95 degrees) dramatically increases the space's capacity. This property is crucial for understanding how language models can efficiently encode semantic meaning in relatively compact embedding spaces.\n\nIn Grant's video, he demonstrated this principle with an experiment attempting to fit 10,000 unit vectors into a 100-dimensional space while maintaining near-orthogonal relationships. The visualization suggested success, showing angles clustered between 89-91 degrees. However, when I implemented the code myself, I noticed something interesting about the optimization process.\n\nThe original loss function was elegantly simple:\n\nloss = (dot_products.abs()).relu().sum()\n\n\n\nWhile this loss function appears perfect for an unbounded ℝᴺ space, it encounters two subtle but critical issues when applied to vectors constrained to a high-dimensional unit sphere:\n\nThe Gradient Trap: The dot product between vectors is the cosine of the angle between them, and the gradient is the sine of this angle. This creates a perverse incentive structure: when vectors approach the desired 90-degree relationship, the gradient (sin(90°) = 1.0) strongly pushes toward improvement. However, when vectors drift far from the goal (near 0° or 180°), the gradient (sin(0°) ≈ 0) vanishes—effectively trapping these badly aligned vectors in their poor configuration. The 99% Solution: The optimizer discovered a statistically favorable but geometrically perverse solution. For each vector, it would be properly orthogonal to 9,900 out of 9,999 other vectors while being nearly parallel to just 99. This configuration, while clearly not the intended outcome, actually represented a global minimum for the loss function—mathematically similar to taking 100 orthogonal basis vectors and replicating each one roughly 100 times.\n\nThis stable configuration was particularly insidious because it satisfied 99% of the constraints while being fundamentally different from the desired constellation of evenly spaced, quasi-orthogonal vectors. To address this, I modified the loss function to use an exponential penalty that increases aggressively as dot products grow:\n\nloss = exp(20*dot_products.abs()**2).sum() (Full code here)\n\nThis change produced the desired behavior, though with a revealing result: the maximum achievable pairwise angle was around 76.5 degrees, not 89 degrees.\n\nThis discovery led me down a fascinating path exploring the fundamental limits of vector packing in high-dimensional spaces, and how these limits relate to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.\n\nWhen I shared these findings with Grant, his response exemplified the collaborative spirit that makes the mathematics community so rewarding. He not only appreciated the technical correction but invited me to share these insights with the 3Blue1Brown audience. This article is that response, expanded to explore the broader implications of these geometric properties for machine learning and dimensionality reduction.\n\nThe Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma: A Geometric Guarantee\n\nAt its core, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma makes a remarkable promise: you can project points from an arbitrarily high-dimensional space into a surprisingly low-dimensional space while preserving their relative distances with high probability. What makes this result particularly striking is that the required dimensionality of the low-dimensional space grows only logarithmically with the number of points you want to project.\n\nFormally, the lemma states that for an error factor ε (between 0 and 1), and any set of N points in a high-dimensional space, there exists a projection into k dimensions where for any two points u and v in the original space, their projections f(u) and f(v) in the lower dimensional space satisfy:\n\n(1 - ε)||u - v||² ≤ ||f(u) - f(v)||² ≤ (1 + ε)||u - v||²\n\nThe number of dimensions (k) required to guarantee these error bounds is given by:\n\nk ≥ O(log(N)/ε²)\n\nThe \"Big O\" notation can be replaced with a concrete constant C:\n\nk ≥ (C/ε²) * log(N)\n\nWhere:\n\nk is the target dimension\n\nN is the number of points\n\nε is the maximum allowed distortion\n\nC is a constant that determines the probability of success\n\nWhile most practitioners use values between 4 and 8 as a conservative choice for random projections, the optimal value of C remains an open question. As we'll see in the experimental section, engineered projections can achieve much lower values of C, with profound implications for embedding space capacity.\n\nThe fascinating history of this result speaks to the interconnected nature of mathematical discovery. Johnson and Lindenstrauss weren't actually trying to solve a dimensionality reduction problem – they stumbled upon this property while working on extending Lipschitz functions in Banach spaces. Their 1984 paper turned out to be far more influential in computer science than in their original domain.\n\nFrom Theory to Practice: Two Domains of Application\n\nThe JL lemma finds practical application in two distinct but equally important domains:\n\nDimensionality Reduction: Consider an e-commerce platform like Amazon, where each customer's preferences might be represented by a vector with millions of dimensions (one for each product). Direct computation with such vectors would be prohibitively expensive. The JL lemma tells us we can project this data into a much lower-dimensional space – perhaps just a thousand dimensions – while preserving the essential relationships between customers. This makes previously intractable computations feasible on a single GPU, enabling real-time customer relationship management and inventory planning. Embedding Space Capacity: This application is more subtle but equally powerful. Rather than actively projecting vectors, we're interested in understanding how many distinct concepts can naturally coexist in a fixed-dimensional space. This is where our experiments provide valuable insight into the practical limits of embedding space capacity.\n\nLet's consider what we mean by \"concepts\" in an embedding space. Language models don't deal with perfectly orthogonal relationships – real-world concepts exhibit varying degrees of similarity and difference. Consider these examples of words chosen at random:\n\n\"Archery\" shares some semantic space with \"precision\" and \"sport\"\n\n\"Fire\" overlaps with both \"heat\" and \"passion\"\n\n\"Gelatinous\" relates to physical properties and food textures\n\n\"Southern-ness\" encompasses culture, geography, and dialect\n\n\"Basketball\" connects to both athletics and geometry\n\n\"Green\" spans color perception and environmental consciousness\n\n\"Altruistic\" links moral philosophy with behavioral patterns\n\nThe beauty of high-dimensional spaces is that they can accommodate these nuanced, partial relationships while maintaining useful geometric properties for computation and inference.\n\nEmpirical Investigation of Embedding Capacity\n\nWhen we move from random projections to engineered solutions, the theoretical bounds for C of the JL lemma become surprisingly conservative. While a Hadamard matrix transformation with random elements can reliably achieve a C value between 2.5 and 4 in a single pass, our GPU experiments suggest even more efficient arrangements are possible through optimization.\n\nTo explore these limits, I implemented a series of experiments projecting standard basis vectors into spaces of varying dimensionality. Using GPU acceleration, I tested combinations of N (number of vectors) up to 30,000 and k (embedding dimensions) up to 10,000, running each optimization for 50,000 iterations. The results reveal some fascinating patterns:\n\nExperimental values of C (GPU optimization)\n\nSeveral key observations emerge from this data:\n\nThe value of C initially rises with N, reaching a maximum around ~0.9 (notably always below 1.0) After peaking, C begins a consistent downward trend At high ratios of N to K, we observe C values trend below 0.2\n\nC values for different dimensions K plotted against increasing N vectors\n\nThis behavior likely relates to an interesting property of high-dimensional geometry: as dimensionality increases, sphere packing becomes more efficient when the spheres are small relative to the unit sphere. This suggests that our observed upper bounds on C might still be conservative for very large numbers of concepts.\n\nPractical Implications for Language Models\n\nLet's consider three scenarios for the constant C:\n\nC = 4: A conservative choice for random projections with Hadamard matrices C = 1: A likely upper bound for optimized or emergent embeddings C = 0.2: A value suggested by our experiments for very large spaces\n\nNumber of possible vectors ranging from \"Efficient random projection C=4\" to \"Optimized projection C=0.2\"\n\nThe implications of these geometric properties are staggering. Let's consider a simple way to estimate how many quasi-orthogonal vectors can fit in a k-dimensional space. If we define F as the degrees of freedom from orthogonality (90° - desired angle), we can approximate the number of vectors as:\n\nVectors ≈ 10^(k * F² / 1500)\n\nwhere:\n\nk is the embedding dimension\n\nF is the degrees of \"freedom\" from orthogonality (e.g., F = 3 for 87° angles)\n\nApplying this to GPT-3's 12,288-dimensional embedding space reveals its extraordinary capacity:\n\nAt 89° (F = 1): approximately 10^8 vectors\n\nAt 88° (F = 2): approximately 10^32 vectors\n\nAt 87° (F = 3): approximately 10^73 vectors\n\nAt 85° (F = 5): more than 10^200 vectors\n\nTo put this in perspective, even the conservative case of 86° angles provides capacity far exceeding the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (~10^80). This helps explain how language models can maintain rich, nuanced relationships between millions of concepts while working in relatively modest embedding dimensions.\n\nPractical Applications and Future Directions\n\nThe insights from this investigation have two major practical implications:\n\nEfficient Dimensionality Reduction: The robustness of random projections, particularly when combined with Hadamard transformations (or BCH coding), provides a computationally efficient way to work with high-dimensional data. No complex optimization required – the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces does the heavy lifting for us. Embedding Space Design: Understanding the true capacity of high-dimensional spaces helps explain how transformer models can maintain rich, nuanced representations of language in relatively compact embeddings. Concepts like \"Canadian,\" \"morose,\" \"Hitchcockian,\" \"handsome,\" \"whimsical,\" and \"Muppet-like\" can all find their place in the geometry while preserving their subtle relationships to each other.\n\nThis research suggests that current embedding dimensions (1,000-20,000) provide more than adequate capacity for representing human knowledge and reasoning. The challenge lies not in the capacity of these spaces but in learning the optimal arrangement of concepts within them.\n\nMy code for Hadamard and optimized projections.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat began as an investigation into a subtle optimization issue has led us to a deeper appreciation of high-dimensional geometry and its role in modern machine learning. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, discovered in a different context nearly four decades ago, continues to provide insight into the foundations of how we can represent meaning in mathematical spaces.\n\nI want to express my sincere gratitude to Grant Sanderson and the 3Blue1Brown channel. His work consistently inspires deeper exploration of mathematical concepts, and his openness to collaboration exemplifies the best aspects of the mathematical community. The opportunity to contribute to this discussion has been both an honor and a genuine pleasure.\n\nI would also like to thank Suman Dev for his help in optimizing the GPU code.\n\nThis was enormously fun to research and write.\n\nNick Yoder\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading",

      "description": "India's IT services industry saw entry-level hiring collapse by 70% between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, as the country's four largest IT exporters reduced fresh graduate recruitment from 225,000 to 60,000. Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys shed a combined 38,000 employees in fiscal 2024, marking the sector's first workforce contraction in decades. \n\nStudies indicate generative AI could automate 30-40% of junior developer and tester tasks. The proportion of employees under 30 at Infosys declined from 81% in 2010 to a projected 53% by fiscal 2025.

      "content": "In Brief\n\nBret Taylor, board chair at OpenAI and CEO of AI agent startup Sierra, was asked in a recent interview with The Verge whether he agreed with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s declaration that “someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money in AI.”\n\nTaylor echoed Altman’s sentiments, suggesting that we are indeed in an AI bubble — but like Altman, he didn’t sound too worried about it.\n\n“I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there’s a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.”\n\nSpecifically, Taylor compared today’s AI landscape to the dot-com bubble of the late ‘90s. While many companies failed when the bubble burst, he argued that “all the people in 1999 were kind of right.”",

      "content": "South African prosecutors will reopen an inquest into the death of the prominent anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, nearly 50 years after he died in police custody.\n\nBiko, the founder of South Africa’s Black Consciousness Movement, died in a prison cell in 1977 aged just 30, after being beaten into a coma by police who had arrested him nearly a month earlier.\n\nThe death sparked outrage across the world and he became an international symbol of the struggle against the race-based apartheid system that denied South Africa’s black majority political and economic rights.\n\n“The main goal of reopening the inquest is to lay before the court evidence that will enable the court to make a finding … as to whether the death was brought about by any act, or omission, which prima facie involves or amounts to an offence on the part of any person,” the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Wednesday.\n\nThe case will be reopened on the 48th anniversary of Biko’s death on 12 September.\n\nA 1977 inquest accepted the police account that Biko sustained injuries when he hit his head against the wall and no one was prosecuted for the death.\n\nBut in 1997, former police officers implicated in the case admitted assaulting the activist during hearings by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) into atrocities committed during the apartheid era.\n\nThe TRC refused to grant amnesty to the officers, ruling that they lied in their evidence and failed to prove a political motive for killing Biko.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Long Wave Free weekly newsletter Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In April the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, launched an inquiry into whether past ANC governments interfered with the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes, amid criticism from the families of victims.\n\nIn June an inquest was opened into one of the period’s most notorious crime: the deaths of four men known as the Cradock Four, who were stopped at a roadblock in 1985 by security officers and beaten, strangled with telephone wire, stabbed and shot to death.",
