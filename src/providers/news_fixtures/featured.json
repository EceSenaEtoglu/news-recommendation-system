      "description": "President Donald Trump announced shock 39% levies on Switzerland on Aug. 1. Swatch has hit back.",
      "content": "A model from Swiss watchmaker Swatch named \"WHAT IF...TARIFFS?\" with the numbers 3 and 9 reversed on its face, as a play on the 39% import tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump slapped on Switzerland last month, is pictured on wrist at a Swatch shop in Geneva, Switzerland, September 12, 2025.\n\nWatchmaker Swatch has launched a special edition model in a dig at U.S. President Donald Trump's punitive 39% tariffs against Switzerland.\n\nDubbed the \"WHAT IF...TARIFFS?\" model, the watch face switches the position of the three and nine in reference to the 39% U.S. levy imposed on Swiss imports last month.\n\nRetailing for 139 Swiss francs ($174) and launched Wednesday, the watch is intended as a limited-edition product, a company spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nThe model, which is only available in Switzerland, was showing as out of stock on the Swiss watchmaker's website Friday.\n\nThe spokesperson added the model was intended as a \"positive provocation\" to authorities and a firm nudge to the Swiss government to secure a better deal.\n\n\"It's in the DNA of Swatch to provoke in a positive way,\" they said via email.\n\n\"We have played with the 39% tariffs imposed on Switzerland by the United States. We hope that this activation will not last long, but that it will be as short as possible.\"\n\n\"As soon as the United States changes its customs duties towards Switzerland, we will immediately stop selling this watch,\" they added.\n\nTrump announced shock 39% levies on Switzerland on Aug. 1, among the highest set by the president globally.",

      "description": "TIOBE attempts to calculate programming language popularity using the number of skilled engineers, courses, and third-party vendors. \nAnd the eight most popular languages in September's rankings haven't changed since last month:\n\n 1. Python\n2. C++\n3. C \n4. Java\n5. C#\n6. JavaScript\n7. Visual Basic\n8. Go \n\n\n\nBut by TIOBE's ranking, Perl is still the #10 most-popular programming in September (dropping from #9 in August). \"One year ago Perl was at position 27 and now it suddenly pops up at position 10 again,\" marvels TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen.\nThe technical reason why Perl is rated this high is because of its huge number of books on Amazon. It has 4 times more books listed than for instance PHP, or 7 times more books than Rust. The underlying \"real\" reason for Perl's increase of popularity is unknown to me. The only possibility I can think of is that Perl 5 is now gradually considered to become the real Perl... Perl 6/Raku is at position 129 of the TIOBE index, thus playing no role at all in the programming world. Perl 5 on the other hand is releasing more often recently, thus gaining attention. \nAn article at the i-Programmer blog thinks Perl's resurgence could be from its text processing capabilities:\n\nEven in this era of AI, everything is still governed by text formats; text is still the King. XML, JSON calling APIs, YAML, Markdown, Log files..That means that there's still need to process it, transform it, clean it, extract from it. Perl with its first-class-citizen regular expressions, the wealth of text manipulation libraries up on CPAN and its full Unicode support of all the latest standards, was and is still the best. Simply there's no other that can match Perl's text processing capabilities. \nThey also cite Perl's backing by the open source community, and its \"getting a 'proper' OOP model in the last couple of years... People just don't know what Perl is capable of and instead prefer to be victims of FOMO ephemeral trends, chasing behind the new and shiny.\" \n\nI'd be curious what Slashdot's readers say. (Share your experiences in the comments if you're still using Perl -- or Raku...) \n\nPerl's drop to #9 means Delphi/Object Pascal rises up one rank, growing from 1.82% in August to 2.26% in September to claim September's #9 spot. \"At number 11 and 1.86%, SQL is quite close to entering the top 10 again,\" notes TechRepublic. (SQL fell to #12 in June, which the site speculated was due to \"the increased use of NoSQL databases for AI applications.\") \nBut TechRepublic adds that the #1 most popular programming language (according to TIOBE) is still Python:\n\nPerl sits at 2.03% in TIOBE&#226;(TM)s proprietary ranking system in September, up from 0.64% in January. Last year, Perl held the 27th position... Python&#226;(TM)s unstoppable rise dipped slightly from 26.14% in August to 25.98% in September.

      "content": "Marquez’s latest victory means he can clinch a seventh MotoGP world title at the next race in Japan in a fortnight.\n\nDucati’s Marc Marquez resisted a spirited challenge from Aprilia’s Marco Bezzecchi to win the San Marino Grand Prix on Sunday, taking his revenge after crashing out of the lead in Saturday’s sprint, and inching closer to the MotoGP title.\n\nBezzecchi had inherited victory in the sprint when Marquez crashed out. This time, however, the determined Spaniard overtook the Aprilia rider on lap 12, having started on the second row of the grid, and never looked back.\n\nMarquez’s 11th race victory of the season takes him to 512 points – a record tally for a MotoGP rider in a single season – and he celebrated his victory by unzipping his leathers and holding his red suit up on the podium like a matador.\n\nGresini Racing’s Alex Marquez finished a distant third, and brother Marc, with a 182-point lead, can clinch his seventh title at the Japanese Grand Prix this month.\n\n“Today I gave everything I had. It’s true that the mistake from yesterday gave me extra concentration, extra power, extra energy,” an exhausted Marc Marquez said.\n\n“I was just there following him [Bezzecchi], trying to push him always super close, because it’s impossible to do 27 laps without any mistake. And in the end, he did a small mistake on turn eight, and then I led the race.\n\n“Super important for Ducati; I felt the pressure this weekend.”\n\nSix more rounds remain, but Marc Marquez can now win his first title since 2019 if he outscores brother Alex by just three points in Japan.\n\nSuperb launch\n\nAt the start, Marc had a superb launch off the line and he veered to the outside to quickly move up to second behind polesitter Bezzecchi while Alex was pushed down to third.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the top three streaked away, Yamaha’s Fabio Quartararo found it difficult to maintain that pace, and he was soon battling with KTM’s Pedro Acosta, who eventually found his way past the former champion to chase the leading pack.\n\nBut Acosta’s hopes of fighting for the podium went up in smoke when he retired with a broken chain, with the young Spaniard furiously wagging his finger at the bike after he stopped on the side of the track.\n\nDucati’s Francesco Bagnaia had another race to forget in a nightmare season for the twice champion, who crashed out of seventh place, his third place in the championship now seriously under threat from Bezzecchi.\n\nUp front, Marc continued piling the pressure on Bezzecchi, and the Aprilia rider finally buckled on lap 12 when he was a breath late on the brakes and went wide, opening the door for the red Ducati to ease past him and into the lead.\n\nUnrelenting Bezzecchi\n\nBezzecchi gave chase, unrelenting and eager to reclaim the lead. But Marc remained calm and the Spaniard was in no mood to crash out of the lead twice in one weekend.\n\nBezzecchi shook his head in frustration with six laps left as Marc set the fastest lap of the race.\n\nMarc tried his best to shake off the younger Italian, who found an extraordinary late race pace to challenge for the lead. But the Ducati rider responded once again as they traded fastest laps and left third-placed Alex more than six seconds behind.\n\n“Besides [missing out on] the victory, this is maybe the best race of my life, because I was super competitive all weekend – pole position, sprint win, second place,” Bezzecchi said.\n\n“I was close to Marc, who is at the moment the strongest on the grid. I’m very happy, I gave my all, I’m destroyed!”\n\nVR46 Racing riders Franco Morbidelli and Fabio Di Giannantonio finished fourth and fifth, respectively, while Gresini’s Fermin Aldeguer was sixth.",

      "title": "Could Heart Attacks Be Triggered By Infections?",
      "description": "Finland's second-largest university has announced new research suggesting that heart attacks could be an infectious disease. \n\n\n\n[T]he research found that, in coronary artery disease, atherosclerotic plaques containing cholesterol may harbor a gelatinous, asymptomatic biofilm formed by bacteria over years or even decades. Dormant bacteria within the biofilm remain shielded from both the patient's immune system and antibiotics because they cannot penetrate the biofilm matrix. \n\nA viral infection or another external trigger may activate the biofilm, leading to the proliferation of bacteria and an inflammatory response. The inflammation can cause a rupture in the fibrous cap of the plaque, resulting in thrombus [blood clot] formation and ultimately myocardial infarction... \"Bacterial involvement in coronary artery disease has long been suspected, but direct and convincing evidence has been lacking,\" explains professor Pekka Karhunen [who led the study with researchers from the UK and Finland]. \"Our study demonstrated the presence of genetic material &mdash; DNA &mdash; from several oral bacteria inside atherosclerotic plaques.\" The findings were validated by developing an antibody targeted at the discovered bacteria, which unexpectedly revealed biofilm structures in arterial tissue. Bacteria released from the biofilm were observed in cases of myocardial infarction. The body's immune system had responded to these bacteria, triggering inflammation which ruptured the cholesterol-laden plaque. \n\nThe observations pave the way for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for myocardial infarction. Furthermore, they advance the possibility of preventing coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction by vaccination. \n\"The research is part of an extensive EU-funded cardiovascular research project involving 11 countries...\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Could+Heart+Attacks+Be+Triggered+By+Infections%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F13%2F1457208%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F13%2F1457208%2Fcould-heart-attacks-be-triggered-by-infections%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/09/13/1457208/could-heart-attacks-be-triggered-by-infections?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

Researchers tested 23 different beers from across the U.S. and found that 95% contained PFAS, with the highest concentrations showing up in regions with known water contamination. The findings reveal how pollution in municipal water supplies can infiltrate popular products, raising concerns for both consumers and brewers... \n\n[PFAS] have been found in surface water, groundwater and municipal water supplies across the U.S. and the world. Although breweries typically have water filtration and treatment systems, they are not designed to remove PFAS...

      "title": "Via shrugs off tepid open to end first day of trading slightly above IPO price",
      "description": "Transit tech software startup Via had its IPO debut on Friday, starting at below offering price before rising to close at nearly $50.",
      "content": "Investors took a cautious approach to transit software startup Via’s IPO on Friday, with shares opening below the company’s IPO price before recovering at the end of the day slightly higher.\n\nThe company, which initially filed confidentially for IPO in July, priced its IPO at $46 per share, raising $492.9 million. Those shares slipped to $44 when the stock began trading Friday afternoon, and then inched back into the green to finish at just over $49. The modest gain values Via at roughly $3.9 billion at the close of its first trading day.\n\nVia raised about $328 million in its IPO, while existing shareholders sold another $164 million worth of stock, bringing the total deal size to nearly $493 million.\n\n“We’re extremely pleased with the result of today’s IPO, and we think it is a testament to the value and durability of the company,” Via CEO Daniel Ramot said. “We are grateful for the feedback and support from our team, partners, and investors who made this milestone possible.”\n\nVia initially launched in 2012 by deploying Via-branded shuttles that users could hail. Over time, Via improved its on-demand routing algorithm, which uses real-time data to route microtransit shuttles to where they’re needed most. Now that tech is its core business, which it sells to 689 cities and transit agencies to power their microtransit.\n\nRamot told TechCrunch the company would use the proceeds to invest in growth, sales, and marketing. And maybe even an acquisition, in the future.\n\n“We’re not necessarily looking to raise funds to drive operations,” Ramot said. “There may be an opportunity for us to use the proceeds and the currency of a public stock to make some interesting acquisitions like we did with Remix and Citymapper.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Ramot said he’s open to other complementary acquisitions, rather than acquisitions to gain market share.\n\nVia revenue has increased roughly 30% year-over-year. The company told TechCrunch that it expects to earn around $429 million in revenue in 2025, a projection based on its quarterly revenue times four.\n\nVia closed the first six months of 2025 with $205.7 million in revenue. But the company is still in the red, though that loss is shrinking. The first six months of 2025 ended at a loss of $37.5 million, down from $50.4 million the previous year.\n\nRamot said Via is close to profitability but declined to give specific projections.\n\nThe executive says Via’s growth is proof that government customers can sustain a lucrative business.\n\n“Most tech companies going public are not very focused on this sector, on helping local government,” he said, adding that the technology Via provides mainly benefits riders of microtransit and paratransit systems, the people who rely on buses to get around.\n\n“Low-income people, people with disabilities, students — those are the demographics that we typically support,” he said. “It’s really nice to see investors actually support that.”",

      "content": "Romania becomes second Nato country to report Russian drone in its airspace\n\nF-16 aircraft detected a Russian drone in Romanian airspace, while monitoring the country's border with Ukraine\n\nOn Wednesday, Poland said it had shot down at least three Russian drones which had entered its airspace.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the incursion could not be a mistake - it was \"an obvious expansion of the war by Russia\". Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims.\n\nRomanian fighter jets were in the air monitoring a Russian attack in Ukraine on Saturday and were able to track the drone near Ukraine's southern border, the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nRomania says a Russian drone has breached its airspace - the second Nato country to report such an incursion.\n\nIn its statement, Romania's defence ministry said it detected the Russian drone when two F-16 jets were monitoring they country's border with Ukraine, after \"Russian air attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure on the Danube\".\n\nThe drone was detected 20km (12.4 miles) south-west of the village of Chilia Veche, before disappearing from the radar.\n\nBut it did not fly over populated areas or pose imminent danger, the ministry said.\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called the incident \"yet another unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty\".\n\nPoland also responded to concerns over Russian drones on Saturday.\n\n\"Preventative operations of aviation - Polish and allied - have begun in our airspace,\" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a post on X.\n\n\"Ground-based air defence systems have reached the highest state of readiness.\"\n\nEarlier this week Russia's defence ministry said there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.\n\nBelarus, a close Russian ally, said the drones which entered Polish airspace on Wednesday were an accident, after their navigation systems were jammed.\n\nOn Sunday, the Czech Republic announced it had sent a special operations helicopter unit to Poland.\n\nThe unit consists of three Mi-171S helicopters, each one capable of transporting up to 24 personnel and featuring full combat equipment.\n\nThe move is in response to Russian's incursion into Nato's eastern flank, the Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova said.\n\nIn response to the latest drone incursion, President Zelensky said the Russian military \"knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air\".\n\nHe has consistently asked Western countries to tighten sanctions on Moscow.\n\nUS President Donald Trump also weighed in on airspace breach earlier this week, saying he was \"ready\" to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if Nato countries met certain conditions, such as stopping buying Russian oil.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress in the battlefield.\n\nTrump has been leading efforts to end the war, but Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin returned from a summit with Trump in Alaska last month.",

      "title": "Klarna IPO and ASML's Mistral bet revive Europe's tech dreams",
      "description": "For years, investors have been talking up Europe's potential to build valuable tech firms. Those dreams could finally be moving closer to reality.",
      "content": "Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and Co-Founder of Swedish fintech Klarna, gives a thumbs up during the company’s IPO at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Sept. 10, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nLONDON — It's been a busy week for the European technology sector. On Tuesday, London-headquartered artificial intelligence startup ElevenLabs announced it would let employees sell shares in a secondary round that doubles its valuation to $6.6 billion. Then, Dutch chip firm ASML on Wednesday confirmed it was leading French AI firm Mistral's 1.7 billion-euro Series C funding round at a valuation of 11.7 billion euros ($13.7 billion) — up from 5.8 billion euros last year. Mistral is considered a competitor to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. To cap it off, Swedish fintech firm Klarna on Thursday debuted on the New York Stock Exchange after a long-awaited initial public offering. Klarna shares ended the day at $45.82, giving it a market value of over $17 billion. These developments have revived hopes that Europe is capable of developing a tech industry that can compete with the U.S. and Asia. For the past decade, investors have been talking up Europe's potential to build valuable tech firms, rebuffing the idea that Silicon Valley is the only place to create innovative new ventures.\n\nwatch now\n\nHowever, dreams of a \"golden era\" of European tech never quite came to fruition. A key curveball came in the form of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which caused inflation to soar and global central banks to hike interest rates as a result. Higher rates are considered bad for capital-intensive tech firms, which often need to raise cash to grow. Ironically, that same year, Klarna — which at one point was valued as much as $45.6 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank — had its market value slashed 85% to $6.7 billion. Now, Europe's venture capital investors view the recent buzz around the region's tech firms as less of a renaissance and more of a \"growing wave.\" \"This started 25 years ago when we saw the first signs of a European tech ecosystem inspired by the original dotcom boom that was very much a Silicon Valley affair,\" Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital, told CNBC. Balderton has backed a number of notable European tech names including fintech firm Revolut and self-driving vehicle tech developer Wayve.\n\nGet a weekly round up of the top tech stories from around the world in your inbox every Friday. Subscribe\n\n\"There have been temporary setbacks: the 2008 financial crisis, the post-Covid tech slump, but the ecosystem has bounced back stronger each time,\" Chandratillake said. \"Right now, the confluence of a huge new technological opportunity in the form of generative AI, as well as a community that has done it before and has access to the capital required, is, unsurprisingly, yielding a huge number of sector-defining companies,\" he added.\n\nEurope vs. U.S.\n\nInvestors backing the continent's tech startups say there's plenty of money to be made — particularly amid the economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. For one, there's a clear discount on European tech right now. Venture firm Atomico's annual \"State of European Tech\" report last year pegged the value of the European tech ecosystem at $3 trillion and predicted it will reach $8 trillion by 2034. Compare that to the story in the U.S., where the tech sector's biggest megacap stocks combined are worth over $20 trillion. \"Ten years ago, there wasn't a single European startup valued at over $50 billion; today, there are several,\" Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures, which has backed the likes of Revolut and Adyen , told CNBC. \"Tens of thousands of people now have firsthand experience building and scaling global companies from companies such as Revolut, Alan, Mistral and Adyen,\" Hammer added. \"Crucially, European startups are no longer simply expanding abroad — they are born global from day one.\"\n\nAmy Nauikoas, founder and CEO of fintech investor Anthemis, suggested that investors may be viewing Europe as something of a safe haven market amid heightened geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty. \"This is an investing opportunity for sure,\" Nauikoas told CNBC. \"Macroeconomic dislocation always favors early-stage entrepreneurial disruption and innovation.\" \"This time around, trends in family office, capital shifts ... and the general constipation of the U.S. institutional allocation market suggest that there should be a lot more money flowing from ... global investors to U.K. [and] European private markets.\"\n\nProblems remain\n\nDespite the bullish sentiment surrounding European tech, there remain systemic challenges that make it harder for the region's tech firms to achieve the scale of their U.S. and Asian counterparts. Startup investors have been pushing for more allocation from pension funds into venture capital funds in Europe for some time. And the European market is highly fragmented, with regulations varying from country to country.",

      "title": "Thieves Busted After Stealing a Cellphone from a Security Expert's Wife",
      "description": "They stole a woman's phone in Barcelona. Unfortunately, her husband was security consultant/penetration tester Martin Vigo, reports Spain's newspaper El Pais. \n\n\"His weeks-long investigation coincided with a massive two-year police operation between 2022 and 2024 in six countries where 17 people were arrested: Spain, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru....\"\n\n\tIn Vigo's case, the phone was locked and the \"Find my iPhone\" feature was activated... Once stolen, the phones are likely wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent the GPS from tracking their movements. \"Then they go to a safe house where they are gathered together and shipped on pallets outside of Spain, to Morocco or China.\" This international step is vital to prevent the phone from being blocked if the thieves try to use it again. Carriers in several European countries share lists of the IMEIs (unique numbers for each device) of stolen devices so they can't be used. But Morocco, for example, doesn't share these lists. There, the phone can be reconnected... \n\nWith hundreds or thousands of stored phones, another path begins: \"They try to get the PIN,\" says Vigo. Why the PIN? Because with the PIN, you can change the Apple password and access the device's content. The gang had created a system to send thousands of text messages like the one Vigo received. To know who to target with the bait message, the police say, \"the organization performed social profiling of the victims, since, in many cases, in addition to the phone, they also had the victim's personal belongings, such as their ID.\" This is how they obtained the phone numbers to send the malicious SMS... \nEach victim received a unique link, and the server knew which victim clicked it... With the first click, the attackers would redirect the user to a website they believed was credible, such as Apple's real iCloud site... [T]he next day you receive another text message, and you click on it, more confidently. However, that link no longer redirects you to the real Apple website, but to a flawless copy created by the criminals: that's where they ask for your PIN, and without thinking, full of hope, you enter it... \"The PIN is more powerful than your fingerprint or face. With it, you can delete the victim's biometric information and add your own to access banking apps that are validated this way,\" says Vigo. Apple Wallet asks you to re-authenticate, and then everything is accessible... \nIn the press release on the case, the police explained that the gang allegedly used a total of 5,300 fake websites and illegally unlocked around 1.3 million high-end devices, about 30,000 of them in Spain. \nVigo tells El Pais that if the PIN doesn't unlock the device, the criminal gang then sends it to China to be \"dismantled and then sent back to Europe for resale. The devices are increasingly valuable because they have more advanced chips, better cameras, and more expensive materials.\" \nTo render the phone untraceable in China, \"they change certain components and the IMEI. It requires a certain level of sophistication: opening the phone, changing the chip...\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Thieves+Busted+After+Stealing+a+Cellphone+from+a+Security+Expert's+Wife%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F0357239%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F14%2F0357239%2Fthieves-busted-after-stealing-a-cellphone-from-a-security-experts-wife%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/09/14/0357239/thieves-busted-after-stealing-a-cellphone-from-a-security-experts-wife?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "title": "Chinese EV players take fight to legacy European automakers on their home turf",
      "description": "Chinese electric carmakers Xpeng and GAC this week signalled aggressive expansion plans in Europe.",
      "content": "Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng speaks to reporters at the electric carmaker's stand at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nGermany this week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf. The IAA Mobility conference in Munich was packed full of companies with huge stands showing off their latest cars and technology. Among some of the biggest displays were those from Chinese electric car companies, underscoring their ambitions to expand beyond China. Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. At the same time, Tesla , which was for so long seen as the electric vehicle market leader, has seen sales decline in the region. Despite Chinese EV makers facing tariffs from the European Union, players from the world's second-largest economy have responded to the ramping up of competition by setting aggressive sales and expansion targets. \"The current growth of Xpeng globally is faster than we have expected,\" He Xiaopeng, the CEO of Xpeng told CNBC in an interview this week.\n\nAggressive expansion plans\n\nChinese carmakers who spoke to CNBC at the IAA show signaled their ambitious expansion plans. Xpeng's He said in an interview that the company is looking to launch its mass-market Mona series in Europe next year. In China, Xpeng's Mona cars start at the equivalent of just under $17,000. Bringing this to Europe would add some serious price competition.\n\nwatch now\n\nMeanwhile, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) is targeting rapid growth of its sales in Europe. Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC that the company aims to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year and at least 50,000 units by 2027. GAC also announced plans to bring two EVs — the Aion V and Aion UT — to Europe. Leapmotor was also in attendance with their own stand. There are signs that Chinese players have made early in roads into Europe. The market share of Chinese car brands in Europe nearly doubled in the first half of the year versus the same period in 2024, though it still remains low at just over 5%, according to Jato Dynamics. \"The significant presence of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers at the IAA Mobility, signals their growing ambitions and confidence in the European market,\" Murtuza Ali, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nTech and gadgets in focus\n\nMany of the Chinese car firms have positioned themselves as technology companies, much like Tesla, and their cars highlight that. Many of the electric vehicles have big screens equipped with flashy interfaces and voice assistants. And in a bid to lure buyers, some companies have included additional gadgets. For example, GAC's Aion V sported a refrigerator as well as a massage function as part of the seating.\n\nThe Aion V is one of the cars GAC is launching in Europe as it looks to expand its presence in the region. The Aion V is on display at the company's stand at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich, Germany on September 9, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nThis is one way that the Chinese players sought to differentiate themselves from legacy brands. \"The chances of success for Chinese automakers are strong, especially as they have an edge in terms of affordability, battery technology, and production scale,\" Counterpoint's Ali said.\n\nEurope's carmakers push back\n\nLegacy carmakers sought to flex their own muscles at the IAA with Volskwagen , BMW and Mercedes having among the biggest stands at the show. Mercedes in particular had advertising displayed all across the front entrance of the event. BMW, like the Chinese players, had a big focus on technology by talking up its so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system. BMW, which introduced the iX3 at the event, and chipmaker Qualcomm also announced assisted driving software that the two companies co-developed. Volkswagen and French auto firm Renault also showed off some new electric cars. Regardless of the product blitz, there are still concerns that European companies are not moving fast enough. BMW's new iX3 is based on the electric vehicle platform it first debuted two years ago. Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers have been quick in bringing out and launching newer models. \"A commitment to legacy structures and incrementalism has slowed its ability to build and leverage a robust EV ecosystem, leaving it behind fast moving rivals,\" Tammy Madsen, professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said of BMW. While European autos have a strong brand history and their CEOs acknowledged and welcomed the competition this week in interviews with CNBC, the Chinese are not letting up.\n\nwatch now",

      "description": "It was \"little more than empty fields\" five years ago &mdash; but it's now \"a vast, heavily guarded complex stretching for 210 hectares (520 acres),\" reports the Guardian, \"the frontline of a multibillion-dollar criminal fraud industry fuelled by human trafficking and brutal violence.\"\n\nMyanmar, Cambodia and Laos have in recent years become havens for transnational crime syndicates running scam centres such as KK Park, which use enslaved workers to run complex online fraud and scamming schemes that generate huge profits. There have been some attempts to crack down on the centres and rescue the workers, who can be subjected to torture and trapped inside. But drone images and new research shared exclusively with the Guardian reveal that the number of such centres operating along the Thai-Myanmar border has more than doubled since Myanmar's military seized power in 2021, with construction continuing to this day. \nData from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi), a defence thinktank in Canberra, shows that the number of Myanmar scam centres on the Thai border has increased from 11 to 27, and they have expanded in size by an average of 5.5 hectares a month. Drone images and photographs of KK Park and other Myanmar scam centres, Tai Chang and Shwe Kokko, taken by the Guardian in August show new features and active building work... Myanmar's military junta has allowed the spread of scam centres inside the country as these criminal enterprises have become an essential part of the country's conflict economy since the coup, helping it rise to the top of the global list of countries harbouring organised crime. According to Aspi's analysis, Myanmar's military, which has lost huge swathes of territory since the coup and is struggling to retain its grip on power, cannot take meaningful measures against the scam compounds without endangering its precarious relations with the crucial armed militias who are profiting from them. \n\nWhile 7,000 people were freed from the compounds earlier this year, \"Thai police estimated earlier this year that as many as 100,000 people were held inside Myanmar scam centres,\" the article notes. \n\nElsewhere the Guardian reports that \"The centres are run by Chinese criminal gangs,\" and describes people who unwittingly came to Thailand for customer service jobs, only to be trafficked to Myanmar's guarded \"cyberslavery compounds\" and \"forced to send thousands of messages from fake social-media profiles, posing as a rich American investor to swindle US real estate agents into cryptocurrency scams.\"\nSince 2020, south-east Asia's cyber-slavery industry has entrapped hundreds of thousands of people and forced them to perform \"pig butchering\" &mdash; the brutal term for building trust with a fraud target before scamming them. At first, the industry mostly captured Chinese and Taiwanese people, then it moved on to south-east Asians and Indians &mdash; and now Africans. \n\nCriminal syndicates have been shifting towards scamming victims in the US and Europe after Chinese efforts to prevent its citizens being targeted, experts told the Guardian. That has led some trafficking networks to seek recruits with English-language and tech skills &mdash; including east Africans, thousands of whom are now estimated to be trapped inside south-east Asian compounds, says Benedikt Hofmann, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's representative for south-east Asia and the Pacific. \n\nThanks to long-time Slashdot reader mspohr for sharing the article.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Myanmar's+'Cyber-Slavery+Compounds'+May+Hold+100%2C000+Trafficked+People%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F13%2F195226%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F09%2F13%2F195226%2Fmyanmars-cyber-slavery-compounds-may-hold-100000-trafficked-people%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/09/13/195226/myanmars-cyber-slavery-compounds-may-hold-100000-trafficked-people?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "description": "While interviewing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this week, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson brought up his belief in a conspiracy theory that former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji was “definitely murdered.” The researcher’s death in November 2024, which was ruled a suicide by the San Francisco police, followed his release of statements online and in [&#8230;]",
      "content": "Carlson: “…he was definitely murdered, I think… there were signs of a struggle, of course. The surveillance camera, the wires had been cut. He had just ordered take-out food, come back from a vacation with his friends on Catalina Island. No indication at all that he was suicidal. No note and no behavior. He had just spoken to a family member on the phone.\n\nAnd then he’s found dead with blood in multiple rooms. So that’s impossible. Seems really obvious he was murdered.

      "title": "Malawi election: Lazarus Chakwera and Peter Mutharika face off in re-match of 2020",
      "description": "With long petrol queues on city roads, everyday issues dominate in the run-up to Tuesday's vote.",
      "content": "Malawi - where the petrol queue might overshadow the queue to vote\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Nomsa Maseko BBC Africa, Lilongwe and Mangochi Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nThe queue to get fuel rather than the queue to vote is what is on the mind of many Malawians as Tuesday's general election approaches. Prolonged petrol shortages, along with regular power cuts, the rising cost of living, hunger, poverty, inequality and youth unemployment, add to the tangible frustration here. The presidential, parliamentary and local council candidates are competing for votes against a background of cynicism about what might actually change. In a sign that money is tight, electioneering has been somewhat muted compared to the past. This is despite the presidential race being seen as a rematch between the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, and the man he beat in 2020, then-President Peter Mutharika.\n\nThere are 15 other candidates. But the usual colourful campaign carnival is missing. The free T-shirts usually doled out with abandon to whip up enthusiasm are more limited. There are fewer giant election billboards on the nation's main roads. Back in the snaking petrol lines, patience runs thin, which has at times led to fist fights.\n\nBBC / AFP via Getty Images Peter Mutharika (L) and Lazarus Chakwera (R) have been political rivals for the past decade\n\nSensing the fuel shortage was becoming an election issue, Chakwera has tried to tackle it head on. In a televised address, eight days before polls open, he acknowledged the frustration and apologised. The president then turned his fire on allegedly corrupt officials who he accused of deliberately sabotaging the oil market. Like fuel, new job opportunities are also hard to come by. To put food on the table, young men have been selling petrol and diesel using small plastic containers at five times the official price. In the southern town of Mangochi, they refused to be interviewed except to say, as they walked away, that preying on desperate motorists was the only way to survive. With food costs rising at more than 30% in the past year, and wages not keeping pace, things are becoming harder to afford. The high inflation rate has been partly put down to a shortage of foreign currency, which has forced some importers to buy US dollars on the more expensive black market. The costs have then been passed on to the consumer.\n\nThe effect of the economic troubles on young people could be particularly significant in this election – as around half of registered voters are under the age of 35. And yet the two leading presidential candidates are considerably older. Chakwera is 70 and Mutharika is 85. \"When young people cast their ballots next week, they should think about the poverty crisis. The coming president should fix the employment rate because many of the young people are unemployed,\" said 33-year-old Monica Chinoko, who works in the capital, Lilongwe. Many younger voters have told the BBC that these continuous problems have dampened enthusiasm for the elections. \"Looking at the candidates - it's really a tough choice to make because hope has been lost. We've been voting and voting but things haven't gotten better,\" said Ashley Phiri, 35. \"But I'm hoping that this time around, the next leader will radically transform Malawi.\"\n\nSupporters of opposition candidate Peter Mutharika argue that things were better when he was in State House\n\nMutharika's election convoy has made several stops in the villages along the Bakili Muluzi highway. In one place, a supporter held up a sign saying \"back to state house\" and said life was better when the former president was in office. At a Mutharika rally in Machinga, an elderly woman wearing a colourful headscarf and sarong held up a huge bucket and shouted \"fertiliser\". What is at stake in Malawi's elections?\n\n'I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap' She was highlighting the crucial issue for the 80% of the population who live in rural areas. Many of these people survive on what they grow on their smallholdings and make money from what is left over. Chakwera had promised to reduce the cost of the vital farming input – but the price has gone in the opposite direction. It is now six times more than it was in 2019. The president has \"accused some opposition parties of working with private traders to distort fertiliser prices\", his office said. He has pledged to smallholder farmers that the price will come back down under a targeted programme due to start next month.\n\nSupporters of Lazarus Chakwera are confident he will be re-elected\n\nChakwera has had a tough five years at the helm but remains optimistic. He says he is investing in the future of the country and as a headline policy he has pledged that the state will deposit 500,000 Malawi kwacha ($290; £210) in individual accounts for every child born after the general election. They will be able to access it once they reach 18. Another former president, Joyce Banda – the country's only female head of state – is also running again. She has pledged to fight corruption, transform the economy and improve rural infrastructure. The other presidential candidates, including Atupele Muluzi, Dalitso Kabambe and current Vice-President Michael Usi, have all promised radical change in one of the world's poorest countries. There is no shortage of choice on the ballot paper, but Malawians will be hoping that whoever emerges as the winner – after Tuesday's vote or a possible second round – will be able to put more food on the table and more fuel in the tank.\n\nMore BBC stories about Malawi:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",
