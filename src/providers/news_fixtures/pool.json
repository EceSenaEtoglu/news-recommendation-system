      "content": "'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shooting\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Nardine Saad and Max Matza Share Save\n\nWatch: Charlie Kirk's widow Erika makes first public statement since deadly shooting\n\nCharlie Kirk's widow, Erika, has given a tearful address in which she thanked first responders for trying to save her husband's life after he was fatally shot on a Utah university campus. In a livestream, standing beside her husband's empty chair that he used during podcast tapings, she quoted the Bible and spoke about his love for President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, the US and the couple's two children. Kirk, a 31-year-old right-wing activist, was shot dead on Wednesday during an open-air speaking event in Orem. His suspected killer, Tyler Robinson, was arrested on Thursday night after surrendering to police. In her remarks, Mrs Kirk pledged: \"My husband's voice will remain.\"\n\nShooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divide\n\nSuspected killer brought into custody after confessing to father Friday's broadcast from Turning Point USA's headquarters in Arizona began with several minutes of silence, as the camera framed Charlie Kirk's empty chair. As his widow started speaking, she looked upwards and whispered a silent prayer. She then thanked first responders who tried to save him, her husband's staff, and the White House. \"Mr President, my husband loved you. And he knew that you loved him too,\" she said tearfully, also thanking Vance and his wife Usha for accompanying the casket back to Arizona. \"But most of all, Charlie loved his children. And he loved me. With all his heart. And he made sure I knew that every day.\" In a later Instagram post, Mrs Kirk echoed comments she made on the livestream and shared videos and photos of her sitting over her husband's casket. One video showed her kissing Kirk's hand as he lies in the casket dressed in a suit and tie.\n\nEric Thayer/Getty Images Erika Kirk holds hands with Second Lady Usha Vance as they arrive in Arizona on Air Force Two\n\nAddressing \"evil-doers\", Mrs Kirk, 36, had earlier told the livestream: \"You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife, the cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry. \"They should all know this: if you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before you have no idea, you have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country and this world.\" Her husband's tour of US university campuses will continue throughout the autumn, and in the years to come, she said, without offering further details. His podcast will also continue. Mrs Kirk also spoke of their one-year-old son and three-year-old daughter, saying that she was at a loss for how to explain their father's sudden death. \"Baby, daddy loves you so much. Don't you worry. He's on a work trip with Jesus,\" she told their daughter. The conservative influencer who rallied a youth movement\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson, the shooting suspect? Erika Kirk is a businesswoman and former Miss Arizona USA winner, who met her husband in 2018. The couple were engaged by 2020 and wed less than a year later. She is currently studying for a doctorate in Bible studies, has launched a ministry programme and hosts the Midweek Rise Up podcast focused on Biblical leadership. Mrs Kirk also acts and models, and has a faith-based clothing line. Although the children and the couple's home life are regular fixtures on her social media pages, they never publish images showing their children's faces.\n\nCharlie Kirk, a controversial figure in US political discourse, had been hailed by many as the future of American conservatism with a knack for energising young conservatives. By mobilising the youth vote, he was an instrumental organiser in Trump's Maga coalition and helped return him to the White House for a second term. Kirk was a strong supporter of gun rights, vehemently opposed abortion, was critical of transgender rights and promoted false claims about Covid-19. His views were polarising on the college campuses, where he held large events, and his provocative speeches would draw crowds of vocal opponents as well as fans. Kirk's supporters said he was relatable and understood their concerns. But his views drew fierce liberal criticism, with his detractors said his rhetoric hurt people - especially those in the LGBT community. Young fans and critics debate Charlie Kirk's political legacy\n\nGetty Images Erika and Charlie Kirk at the Turning Point USA Ball in Washington DC in January\n\nKirk was speaking at Utah Valley University during Turning Point USA's The American Comeback Tour, a speaking engagement that took him to several college campuses throughout the US. He was shot during his viral Prove Me Wrong debate while taking a question about gun violence and transgender people in the US. The university's president, Dr Astrid Tuminez, has confirmed both in-person and online classes will resume from 17 September. Dr Tuminez has said increased security will be implemented \"as we heal from this tragic event\". Trump has announced that he will award Kirk a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom - the highest civilian honour a president can bestow - describing his friend and ally as a \"giant of his generation and a champion of liberty\". The US president said that Mrs Kirk \"is absolutely devastated\". Trump earlier said he would be attending in person Kirk's funeral - expected to be held next weekend - in Arizona. Turning Point USA, the organisation Charlie Kirk founded when he was 18 years old, also referred to its co-founder as a \"martyr\" and \"pioneer\". \"Charlie was the ideal husband and the perfect father. Above all else, we ask you to pray for the Kirks after the incomprehensible loss they have suffered,\" the organisation said in a statement to the BBC on Thursday. JD Vance flew to Salt Lake City, Utah, on Thursday to retrieve Kirk's casket and transport it to Phoenix, Arizona - where Kirk's family lives - on the vice-presidential aircraft, Air Force Two. Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance travelled with Kirk's family and some of his friends to Arizona.",

      "content": "Defiant nuns flee care home for their abandoned convent in the Alps\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Bethany Bell Austria correspondent in Salzburg Share Save\n\nBBC Sister Rita (L), Sister Regina (C) and Sister Bernadette were sent to a care home against their will in 2023\n\nThree Austrian nuns in their 80s have run away from the retirement home where they were placed and gone back to their former convent. Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, 86, and Sister Rita, 82, are the last three nuns at the Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, just outside Salzburg. They regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith. Church authorities are not happy - but the nuns are. \"I am so pleased to be home,\" Sister Rita said. \"I was always homesick at the care home. I am so happy and thankful to be back.\" The trio say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023. \"We weren't asked,\" Sister Bernadette said. \"We had the right to stay here until the end of our lives and that was broken.\"\n\nWhen the nuns returned to Schloss Goldenstein, the convent had no water or power, but the school was still functioning\n\nThe three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning. Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was the Austrian film actress Romy Schneider. Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958, and Sister Rita four years later. All three went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress. But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reichersberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from the abbey became the nuns' superior. The community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024, and the remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed.\n\n@nonnen_goldenstein Sister Bernardette is far happier back at the convent serving plum dumplings to Sister Rita\n\nIn December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they were unhappy. At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students. \"I have been obedient all my life, but it was too much,\" Sister Bernadette said. They packed up a few belongings and came back to the convent. The locks to their former apartments had been changed so a locksmith was called.\n\nWhen they first arrived, there was no electricity or water. In a statement, Provost Grasl said the nuns' decision to return to the convent was \"completely incomprehensible\" and \"an escalation\". \"The rooms in the convent are no longer usable and in no way meet the requirements for proper care,\" he said. He said the nuns' \"precarious health conditions\" meant \"that independent living at Goldenstein Convent was no longer possible\". Grasl said the old people's home had provided them with \"absolutely essential, professional, and good medical care\". Many of the nuns' wishes about the future of the convent had been taken into account, he added, including the continuation of the school.\n\nProvost Markus Grasl says the rooms at the convent are no longer usable and the nuns' decision to return is incomprehensible",

Denmark, France and Germany have joined a new mission to bolster the military alliance's eastern flank. Other Nato allies are expected to take part later. Tensions have been high across Europe since Poland accused Russia of an unprecedented incursion. Some of the 19 drones that entered Polish territory were shot down, while others crashed into fields and even a house in eastern Poland. Warsaw said the incursion was deliberate, but Moscow downplayed the incident, saying it had \"no plans to target\" facilities in Poland.\n\nDrones and missiles have occasionally veered into countries bordering Ukraine, including Poland, during Russia's full-scale invasion - but this was the most serious incident of its kind since the war began in February 2022. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \"the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two\". Denmark will contribute two F-16 fighter jets to support Poland's air defence, as well as a warship, its defence ministry said. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"We must not be naive. Putin will stop at nothing, and he is testing us. Therefore, it is crucial... Denmark is contributing to this.\" France has already said it will contribute three Rafale fighter jets, and Germany has pledged four Eurofighters. The UK is \"fully committed\" to help strengthen the Eastern Sentry operation, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement, adding that it will provide more details soon.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock Several Russian drones crashed into fields in Poland",

She also claimed Meta had not followed due process.\n\nIn its ruling, the court said that, while it recognised the social media platform's need to moderate content, this did not justify closing a porn star's account \"without a clear and transparent justification\".\n\nIt also found Meta \"applied its policies on nudity and sexual services inconsistently\", with other accounts with similar content remaining active.\n\nThe court said social media posts were protected under Colombia's constitution and should only be limited in a proportionate way where necessary.\n\nIt ordered Meta to \"review and adjust Instagram's terms of use and privacy policy so that users are clearly aware of the mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions\" and \"more precisely define\" its rules on implicit sexual content.\n\nIf social media platforms use offline activities as a criterion for content moderation, they must clearly state these, the court said.\n\nThe court did not specify sanctions for non-compliance, nor whether Ms Gómez would receive any redress.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Meta for comment.\n\nIt is not the first time that a South American court has required a social network to change its policies.\n\nBrazil's Supreme Court recent ruled that social media were directly liable for illegal content, including hate speech, and must immediately act to remove it and accounts proliferating it.\n\nThat ruling followed a judge ordering the suspension of dozens of X accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation.\n\nIt led to the social media platform briefly being banned in Brazil, before it began complying with the ruling and paid a $5.1 (£3.8m) fine.",

Tyler Robinson was taken into custody late on Thursday, after a 33-hour manhunt that ended after his father helped persuade him to surrender to police. His arrest was first announced by US President Donald Trump, who called for the suspect to face the death penalty. The killing of Kirk, who was shot while debating with students on Wednesday, has shocked Americans and laid bare the country's sharp partisan divisions.\n\nFollow live updates\n\nShooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divide\n\n'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shooting Investigators said at a news conference on Friday that the suspect had confessed to his father and said he would rather take his own life than surrender. The father then called a youth pastor who is a family friend. Both men tried to calm the suspect down, police said. The pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, later called the US Marshals, who detained the suspect at around 22:00 local time on Thursday. Utah's Governor Spencer Cox said surveillance images showed Mr Robinson arriving on the campus of Utah Valley University around four hours before a shot rang out, killing Kirk and sending students running for cover. Cox told journalists that when Mr Robinson was taken into custody, he was wearing clothing similar to what was seen on CCTV cameras at the scene of the shooting. The governor added that investigators had interviewed a family member, who said the suspect had become more political in recent years. Cox said the family member had spoken of a recent incident when Mr Robinson had mentioned that Kirk was coming to Utah and that he \"was full of hate and spreading hate\".\n\nBBC reports from Utah home linked to Charlie Kirk shooting suspect\n\nCox said investigators had also spoken to a roommate of the suspect who had shown them exchanges of messages with an account named \"Tyler\" on the messaging app Discord. The messages referred to a need to retrieve a rifle from \"a drop point\" and the firearm being left in a bush, wrapped in a towel. The FBI said on Thursday that they had found the suspected weapon - an imported Mauser .30-06 bolt action rifle - wrapped in a towel in a wooded area near campus. Cox told reporters that inscriptions had been found engraved on casings recovered with the rifle, which had a scope mounted on top of it. The inscriptions included \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" and \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao\". \"Bella ciao\" means \"goodbye beautiful\" in Italian. It is also the title of a song dedicated to the Italian resistance that fought against the occupying troops of Nazi Germany.\n\nUtah's governor said he was not aware of any potential further arrests in the investigation. State prosecutors said they planned to file formal charges against Mr Robinson on Tuesday. He is accused of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm, according to a Utah County Sheriff inmate booking sheet obtained by the BBC.",

Just say when?\"\n\nHe added \"the purchase of Russian oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia\".\n\nTrump also claimed the halt on Russian energy purchases, combined with heavy tariffs on China \"to be fully withdrawn\" after the war, would be of \"great help\" in ending the conflict.\n\nEurope's reliance on Russian energy has fallen dramatically since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2022, the EU got about 45% of its gas from Russia.

We can't have any deals if we want to stop them.\"\n\nSince 2022, European nations have spent around €210bn (£182bn) on Russian oil and gas, according to the think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, much of which will have funded the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe EU has previously committed to phasing out the purchases by 2028. The US want that to happen faster - partly by buying supplies from them instead.\n\nTrump's message was to Nato, not the EU, therefore including nations such as Turkey, a major buyer of Russian oil and a country that has maintained closer relations with Moscow that any other member of the alliance.\n\nPersuading Ankara to cut off Russian supplies may be a far harder task.\n\nTrump's most recent threat of tougher sanctions on Russia came earlier in September after the Kremlin's heaviest bombardment on Ukraine since the war began.\n\nAsked by reporters if he was prepared to move to the \"second phase\" of punishing Moscow, Trump replied: \"Yeah, I am,\" though gave no details.\n\nThe US previously placed tariffs of 50% on goods from India - which included a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for the war in Ukraine.",

Faye Hall was arrested with Peter, 80, and Barbie Reynolds, 76 on 1 February when returning to Bamiyan Province, Afghanistan, where the couple lived. While Ms Hall was released after two months, Peter and Barbie remain in prison and still do not know why they are being held. The Foreign Office (FCDO) said it was supporting the family of a couple being held in Afghanistan.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast in her first interview since being released, Ms Hall broke down in tears when asked what she would like to tell the couple. \"I love them, I know they will be out very soon, don't ever give up.\" Mr and Mrs Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years prior to their arrest - the reason for which has not been confirmed despite four court appearances. The pair had Afghan citizenship and ran a charity programme in the country, approved by the Taliban when they took power in 2021.

      "content": "'We escaped certain death': Israel intensifies Gaza City bombardment, forcing families to flee\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Rushdi Abualouf Gaza correspondent and Dearbail Jordan Share Save\n\nReuters Israeli air strikes hit Beach camp in western Gaza City on Sunday\n\nIsraeli forces have stepped up their assault on Gaza City with a wave of heavy air strikes, marking a sharp escalation from previous military operations. Unlike earlier phases of the war, the current offensive has relied heavily on aerial bombardments, with entire apartment blocks and large concrete structures reduced to rubble. The intensification of strikes in recent days has triggered a surge in civilian displacement. Israel has warned all residents of Gaza City to leave immediately in anticipation of a huge ground offensive.\n\nOn Saturday, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said about 250,000 people had left the city and moved south. It also said it had destroyed a high-rise building that it said had been used \"to advance and execute terrorist attacks\" against its troops. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the city is Hamas's last major stronghold. But the plan to occupy Gaza City has brought international criticism. The UN has warned an intensification of the offensive on an area where a famine has already been declared will push civilians into an \"even deeper catastrophe\". Gaza City is the largest urban centre in the territory and a historic heart of Palestinian political and social life. Residents say the Israeli military has been targeting schools and makeshift shelters, often issuing warnings only moments before bombardments. Many families have been forced to flee in darkness toward western Gaza. \"We escaped certain death, my husband, our three children and I,\" said Saly Tafeesh, a mother sheltering in the city. \"My brother died in my arms after being shot by a quadcopter drone. We ran in the dark to the west of Gaza.\" The Israeli military has told residents to evacuate to the south of the territory - but many families say they cannot afford the journey, which costs up to $1,100 (£800). Hamas, meanwhile, has intensified its calls for residents to stay put and resist leaving the city. Rubein Khaled, a father-of-nine preparing to move south, expressed frustration. \"The Hamas preacher at Friday prayers accused anyone leaving Gaza City of being a coward running from the battlefield,\" he said. \"But why doesn't he tell Hamas leaders to surrender and release the Israeli hostages so this war can stop? We don't want to leave either, but we have no choice.\" Israeli forces have not yet reached some eastern neighbourhoods that have remained largely intact since earlier raids in January, but the current campaign suggests they may now be seeking to dismantle entire districts.\n\nReuters About quarter of a million people have left Gaza City, the Israeli military says\n\nMeanwhile, a Qatari foreign ministry spokesman strongly criticised Israel's prime minister in an interview with the BBC following this week's Israeli strike on Hamas officials in the Qatari capital Doha. Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari told the BBC that the international community had \"to deal with a Netanyahu problem\". \"He is not somebody who is listening to anybody right now, who is listening to any reason, and we have to collectively stop him in his tracks,\" the official said. He argued the strike in Doha showed the Israeli leader \"never intended to sign any peace deal\" to end the war in Gaza and instead \"believes he can re-shape the Middle East in his own image\". Five of the group's members and a Qatari security officer were killed in Tuesday's strike - though the Palestinian armed group claimed no senior leaders had been killed. Hamas members had been in Doha to discuss the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has faced widespread condemnation, including at the UN Security Council. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel targeted the \"terrorist masterminds\" behind the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani earlier said that Qatar did not get advance warning of the strike, only receiving a call from a US official 10 minutes after the attack had started. On Friday, al-Thani had dinner with US President Donald Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff in New York, having earlier met Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House. Rubio is travelling to Israel this weekend in a show of solidarity with Israel ahead of a UN meeting later this month at which France and the UK are expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nReuters The Israeli attack in Doha targeted Hamas officials discussing the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza",

But Albania has chosen to turn that insult into a positive quality, by appointing an AI minister. Not a minister for artificial intelligence. Rather, a cabinet member who is, literally, the work of AI. The new addition is, like a pop star, known simply by the single name: Diella. Prime Minister Edi Rama introduced her as a member of his new cabinet on Thursday, four months after securing his fourth term in office in May elections. However, the move was symbolic rather than official, as Albania's constitution insists that government ministers must be mentally competent citizens aged at least 18.\n\nStill, the advantages of appointing a bot over a human are obvious. Diella, whose name means sun in Albanian, is unlikely to be the source of any unflattering leaks about the government. She will only be power-hungry in the sense of the electricity she consumes. And a damaging expenses scandal would appear to be out of the question. In fact, corruption was uppermost in Rama's mind when he made Diella part of his team as minister for public procurement. Her role will be to ensure that Albania will become \"a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption\". \"We're working with a brilliant team, which is not only Albanian but also international, to come out with the first full AI model in public procurement,\" the prime minister told the BBC. \"Not only will we wipe out every potential influence on public biddings – we will also make the process much faster, much more efficient and totally accountable.\" Diella had already been working in Albania even before the government \"appointment\". Her first incarnation was as an AI-powered virtual assistant, guiding applicants through the process to obtain official documents.\n\nReuters Albania's prime minister, Edi Rama, won a fourth term in office in May and introduced his cabinet on Thursday",

      "content": "Japan sets record of nearly 100,000 people aged over 100\n\n1 day ago Share Save Jessica Rawnsley and Stephanie Hogarty Population correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images People in Japan tend to have healthier diets, lower prevalence of common diseases, and a culture of group exercise\n\nThe number of people in Japan aged 100 or older has risen to a record high of nearly 100,000, its government has announced. Setting a new record for the 55th year in a row, the number of centenarians in Japan was 99,763 as of September, the health ministry said on Friday. Of that total, women accounted for an overwhelming 88%. Japan has the world's longest life expectancy, and is known for often being home to the world's oldest living person - though some studies contest the actual number of centenarians worldwide. It is also one of the fastest ageing societies, with residents often having a healthier diet but a low birth rate.\n\nThe oldest person in Japan is 114-year-old Shigeko Kagawa, a woman from Yamatokoriyama, a suburb of the city Nara. Meanwhile, the oldest man is Kiyotaka Mizuno, 111, from the coastal city of Iwata. Health minister Takamaro Fukoka congratulated the 87,784 female and 11,979 male centenarians on their longevity and expressed his \"gratitude for their many years of contributions to the development of society\". The figures were released ahead of Japan's Elderly Day on 15 September, a national holiday where new centenarians receive a congratulatory letter and silver cup from the prime minister. This year, 52,310 individuals were eligible, the health ministry said. In the 1960s, Japan's population had the lowest proportion of people aged over 100 of any G7 country - but that has changed remarkably in the decades since. When its government began the centenarian survey in 1963, there were 153 people aged 100 or over. That figure rose to 1,000 in 1981 and stood at 10,000 by 1998. The higher life expectancy is mainly attributed to fewer deaths from heart disease and common forms of cancer, in particular breast and prostate cancer. Japan has low rates of obesity, a major contributing factor to both diseases, thanks to diets low in red meat and high in fish and vegetables. The obesity rate is particularly low for women, which could go some way to explaining why Japanese women have a much higher life expectancy than their male counterparts. As increased quantities of sugar and salt crept into diets in the rest of the world, Japan went in the other direction - with public health messaging successfully convincing people to reduce their salt consumption. But it's not just diet. Japanese people tend to stay active into later life, walking and using public transport more than elderly people in the US and Europe. Radio Taiso, a daily group exercise, has been a part of Japanese culture since 1928, established to encourage a sense of community as well as public health. The three-minute routine is broadcast on television and practised in small community groups across the country.",

      "content": "Press freedom around the world has suffered its sharpest fall in 50 years as global democracy weakens dramatically, a landmark report has found.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), democracy has declined in 94 countries over the last five years and only a third have made progress.\n\n“Democracy faces a perfect storm of autocratic resurgence and acute uncertainty, due to massive social and economic changes,” Kevin Casas-Zamora, the secretary-general of the thinktank, said.\n\n“To fight back, democracies need to protect key elements of democracy, like elections and the rule of law, but also profoundly reform government so that it delivers fairness, inclusion and shared prosperity.”\n\nThe International IDEA’s survey – the Global State of Democracy Report 2025 – is published annually and considered the most comprehensive of its kind, covering 174 countries and measuring democratic performance from 1975.\n\nThe survey found that the freedom of the press had worsened in a quarter of the countries, marking the broadest deterioration since the beginning of the dataset.\n\nThe three largest declines were seen in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso and Myanmar, all suffering historically high levels of civil conflict, poverty and political instability. The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his government used defamation lawsuits to silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year.\n\nThe report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. In New Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently.\n\n“Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes.\n\nChile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families.\n\nThe thinktank highlighted some positive developments: Africa recorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too.\n\nBut the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote.\n\n“These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said.\n\nIn 2021, International IDEA added the US to its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019.\n\nOne measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues.\n\n“Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.",

She had been given a long jail term last month after being detained on the border as she entered Belarus in March 2024. UK Europe Minister Stephen Doughty said \"it is great news that a British national has been brought home\". Fifty-two prisoners were freed from Belarus on Thursday as part of an agreement between US President Donald Trump and authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who is a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn exchange for the release of political prisoners, the US said it would relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing the carrier to buy parts for its planes. Stephen Doughty called the release \"a significant breakthrough\" and thanked the US for \"substantial diplomatic efforts to secure this outcome\". The prisoners released included trade union leaders, journalists and activists, but more than 1,000 political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus. Julia Fenner had previously worked at the British embassy in Minsk before marrying British diplomat Martin Fenner, according to human rights group Charter 97. Martin Fenner was deputy head of mission in Minsk for four years in the early 2000s. Another rights group, Spring 96, recognised Mrs Fenner as a political prisoner who had been imprisoned in a penal colony. Although the reason for Belarus charging her was never explained, she was accused under two articles of the criminal code, for active participation in actions that grossly violate public order and assistance to extremist activity. All opposition has been quashed by Belarusian authoritarian leader Lukashenko, 71, who has been in power since 1994. He described the release of the 52 prisoners as a humanitarian gesture, after meeting Donald Trump's special envoy John Coale in the capital Minsk on Thursday. In a news conference on Friday, Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya thanked the US president for securing the prisoners' release.\n\nEPA Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya (left of centre; wearing pink) welcomes released prisoners from Belarus in front of the American embassy in Vilnius, Lithuania\n\nAn estimated 1,300 political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus, but Tikhanovskaya said the release of the 52 prisoners on Thursday was a step in the right direction. \"What happened yesterday wasn't a real freedom,\" she warned. \"It was forced deportation\". The opposition leader added that she is \"very worried about the fate of Mikola Statkevich\" - a veteran dissident who refused to leave Belarus yesterday and cross into Lithuania.

      "content": "Politicians in at least 51 countries used homophobic or transphobic rhetoric during elections last year, from depicting LGBTQ+ identity as a foreign threat to condemning “gender ideology”, according to a new study of 60 countries and the EU.\n\nHowever, there were also gains for LGBTQ+ representation in some countries. Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time in Botswana, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil.\n\nAs the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems.\n\nThere is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nHe said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … or Hungary or the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.”\n\nLGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as the first transgender member of the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according to data from advert tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nIn the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”.\n\nDuring election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+.\n\nBefore the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right parties made big gains, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally.\n\nIn Indonesia, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote.\n\nThe Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”",

      "content": "Six people have been shot dead in two days in a crime-plagued area of Cape Town, adding to the death toll in a city already reeling from the scourge of gang-related violence.\n\nAt 11.30pm on Monday, two women, aged 19 and 25, were killed and a 24-year-old woman injured in a shooting in Wallacedene, an informal settlement on Cape Town’s north-eastern edge, South African police said. About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked.\n\nThe suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal.\n\nOn 5 September, a man was shot dead at a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, the third killing in a Cape Town court since April.\n\nCape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according to data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz, a Mexican NGO.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according to city authorities, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950.\n\n“Our communities are fearful,” Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. “We don’t have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.”\n\nWestern Cape police said last week they were carrying out “targeted operations” in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: “The message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.”\n\nThe acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for “intelligence-driven operations” to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime, local media reported.\n\n“There is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,” said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance.\n\nMore than 26,000 people were murdered in South Africa last year, South African police data shows. Almost 3,500 of those were in Cape Town, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz.",

      "content": "More children around the world are obese than underweight for the first time, according to a UN report that warns ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets.\n\nThere are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10 – Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases.\n\nCatherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children.\n\n“Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health.”\n\nWhile 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sulakshyan, 10, and his brother Subharna, 7, watch videos at home in Kathmandu. Nepal’s urbanisation has made ultra-processed food more widespread. Photograph: Bishal Bisht/Unicef\n\nObesity has overtaken being underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is a problem even in countries with high numbers of children suffering from wasting or stunting due to a lack of food.\n\nThe report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children, used data from more than 190 countries and sources including Unicef, the World Health Organization and the World Bank.\n\nIt revealed that one in five of those aged between five and 19 are overweight, with a growing proportion of those 291 million individuals falling into the obese category: 42% in 2022, up from 30% in 2000.\n\nObesity was highest in Pacific Island countries, where there has been “a shift from traditional diets to cheap, energy-dense, imported food”, the report found. In Niue, 38% of five to 19-year-olds are obese, and the figure is 37% in the Cook Islands. Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%).\n\nIn the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%.\n\nThe steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”.\n\nChildhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life.\n\nThere is growing international concern about the damaging health impacts of UPFs, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt.\n\nUPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sweets on sale at a roadside stall in Nairobi. In the past 20 years, the percentage of obese adolescent girls in Kenya has more than doubled to 13%. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nNomathemba Chandiwana, chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Cape Town, South Africa, said: “We often only think of malnutrition here as underweight or stunting, but obesity has the same long-term consequences.\n\n“About one in eight children are overweight or have obesity, while one in four are stunted. That double burden is shaping a generation’s health,” she said, adding that children were targeted by “relentless” marketing of fast food, even in schools.\n\n“It’s really tough trying to tackle both undernutrition and obesity at the same time. South Africa is a middle-income country, but still deeply unequal. Many children grow up both hungry and surrounded by cheap, poor-quality food.\n\n“Most of the attention and resources go to undernutrition and stunting in the early years, which of course matters, but obesity isn’t always seen as malnutrition, so it slips under the radar,” she said.\n\nGrowing rates of childhood obesity will have a major impact economically. The World Obesity Federation has previously estimated that by 2035, the global cost of overweight and obesity will surpass $4tn (£2.9tn) annually.\n\nView image in fullscreen Children in Kampala, Uganda, consume snacks and sugary drinks during a school break. Obesity is not always seen as malnutrition. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nThe report highlighted the positive action of Mexico’s ban on the sale and distribution of UPFs in schools.\n\nBut it added that “the unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments”.\n\nUnicef called on governments to act on this by using labelling, marketing restrictions, taxes and subsidies. It suggested banning junk foods and their marketing in schools, and better programmes for vulnerable families to afford nutritious diets.\n\nThere should be “strong safeguards to protect public-policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry”, it said.",

      "content": "Four years have passed since Jair Bolsonaro laid out three possible denouements for his extraordinary political career, during which the oft-ridiculed fringe politician rose to become one of leading lights of the global populist right alongside Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump.\n\n“Going to jail, being killed or victory,” predicted Brazil’s then president as he grappled with a deluge of political crises in August 2021.\n\nBolsonaro was right. A majority of Brazil’s supreme court judges found the 70-year-old guilty on Thursday of masterminding a failed military coup designed to stop the leftwing winner of the 2022 election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office.\n\n“Nowhere in the world … has complete immunity against the virus of authoritarianism that creeps in insidiously, distilling its poison to contaminate freedoms and human rights,” Justice Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha told a courtroom in the capital, Brasília, as she cast the deciding vote.\n\nBolsonaro was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. Seven co-conspirators were also convicted, including the former head of the navy, Adm Almir Garnier Santos, three four-star army generals, and the former head of Brazil’s answer to MI6.\n\nThe historic verdict – the first time a former Brazilian president has been found guilty of trying to overthrow the country’s democracy – appears to have extinguished Bolsonaro’s hopes of one day reclaiming the presidency of South America’s largest democracy.\n\nBut experts and politicians from across the spectrum agree the former paratrooper’s political movement, Bolsonarismo, will continue to thrive despite the incarceration of its creator. Bolsonaro received more than 58m votes in the 2022 election and, despite his conviction, remains wildly popular with certain sectors of society, including the fast growing evangelical community, in Brazil’s agricultural heartlands and among members of the security forces and well-educated middle-class conservatives who loathe the left. Pro-Bolsonaro protests still draw tens of thousands of citizens on to the streets.\n\n“It might be the end of Bolsonaro but it is not the end of Bolsonarismo … Bolsonarismo will live on with or without Bolsonaro,” predicted Thaís Oyama, a columnist for O Globo newspaper and the author of a book about the former president.\n\nGuilherme Boulos, a leading leftwing congress member, said Bolsonaro’s downfall was an undeniable blow to the Brazilian right ahead of next year’s presidential election in which Lula will seek a fourth term.\n\nBut would it snuff out Bolsonaro’s movement?\n\n“No,” Boulos replied emphatically during an interview in his congressional office overlooking some of the buildings vandalised by Bolsonaro supporters during their January 2023 rampage through Brasília. “The far right – in Brazil and around the world – has built a solid social base which goes well beyond the figure of Bolsonaro.\n\n“Bolsonaro is the leader of this movement in Brazil. But to claim his imprisonment will put an end to a certain kind of fascism of the masses that has been built on the defence of authoritarian, prejudiced, intolerant, xenophobic ideas, wouldn’t be true. That wouldn’t be reading the Brazilian reality as it is.”\n\nBoulos, 43, is widely viewed as an heir to the 79-year-old Lula.\n\nBolsonaro is unlikely to be taken into custody for several weeks. It is unclear whether he will be sent to a regular prison or be jailed in a police or military installation.\n\nAlready, though, minds are turning to which politician will inherit his votes in next year’s presidential election. Contenders include his senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, and the former first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, a charismatic born-again Christian popular with evangelical voters and conservative women.\n\n“People were electrified when Michelle came out to speak [at a recent rally in São Paulo]. She’s already a political celebrity,” said Camila Rocha, a political scientist who studies Brazil’s new right. “I’d say Michelle could turn out to be an Evita Perón of the Brazilian extreme right. She has the potential.”\n\nOthers believe the smart money is on São Paulo’s rightwing governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, a former army captain who was infrastructure minister in Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. On the eve of this week’s verdict, Freitas lashed out at the judicial “tyranny” of the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes – a move clearly designed to appeal to orphaned Bolsonaro voters seeking a new leader.\n\nOyama said that by radicalising his rhetoric, Freitas was trying to seduce those orphans and stop the right fragmenting after Bolsonaro’s incarceration, with hardcore Bolsonaristas siding with one of his relatives or another populist successor, and members of the conservative establishment backing another, less radical name. “Lula will without doubt win re-election if the right splits,” she predicted.\n\nWhoever emerges as Bolsonaro’s successor, Boulos expects next year’s election to be a gruelling battle for the left against a rightwing movement he believes will receive support from Donald Trump and US big-tech firms.\n\nTrump unsuccessfully tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial, claiming the prosecution was “a political execution” and a “witch hunt” designed to destroy his ally’s career.\n\nIn the lead-up to this week’s judgement, Trump hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and sanctioned Moraes. Asked about the situation in Brazil on Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters Trump was “unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America, to protect free speech around the world”.\n\nBoulos believes US pressure will continue in the lead-up to the 2026 vote, even with Bolsonaro behind bars. “We’re talking about the richest companies on the planet, the planet’s biggest billionaires, and the president of the most powerful nation on earth taking direct action in Brazil to favour the extreme right,” he said. “It’s going to be war.”",

      "content": "None of the 11 people killed in a US military strike on a boat in the Caribbean last week were members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, Venezuela’s interior minister has said, while US media reported the attack came after the vessel had turned around and was heading back to shore.\n\nThe administration of Donald Trump has said the boat was transporting illegal narcotics, but has provided little further information about the incident, even amid demands from members of the US Congress for a justification for the action.\n\n“They openly confessed to killing 11 people,” Venezuela’s interior minister and ruling party head, Diosdado Cabello, said on state television. “We have done our investigations here in our country and there are the families of the disappeared people who want their relatives, and when we asked in the towns, none were from Tren de Aragua, none were drug traffickers.\n\n“A murder has been committed against a group of citizens using lethal force,” added Cabello, questioning how the US could determine whether drugs were on the boat and why the people were not instead arrested.\n\n“How did they identify them as members of the Tren de Aragua? Did they have, I don’t know, a chip? Did they have a QR code and [the US military] read it from above in the dark?” Cabello said.\n\nThe Venezuelan government said after the incident that a video post by Trump of the strike was artificial intelligence.\n\nUS national security officials acknowledged during a closed briefing this week on Capitol Hill that the boat was fired on multiple times by the US military after it had changed course, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe emerging details came as several senators, Democrats and some Republicans, indicated dissatisfaction with the administration’s rationale and questioned the legality of the action. They view it as a potential overreach of executive authority in part by using the military for law enforcement purposes.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and two dozen other Democratic senators said the Trump administration has provided “no legitimate legal justification” for the strike.\n\n“Our armed forces are not law enforcement agencies,” said Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a floor speech this week. “They are not empowered to hunt down suspected criminals and kill them without trial,” Reed said.\n\nReed said in his speech that the administration has offered “no proof that this vessel was engaged in an attack, or even that it was engaged in drug trafficking at the time.” He also said the administration has provided “no positive identification that the boat was Venezuelan, nor that its crew were members of Tren de Aragua or any other cartel.”\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Raul has said it was unlikely the boat was headed to US shores, which would be a lengthy trip for such a vessel.\n\nPaul – a libertarian-leaning Republican with a long history of challenging executive overreach, particularly in national security matters – has argued the US cannot simply kill people suspected of wrongdoing without due process.\n\nIn response, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said “These were evil Tren de Aragua narco-terrorists trying to bring illegal drugs into our country and kill Americans” and that the “president acted in line with the laws of armed conflict”.\n\nKelly also said Nicolás Maduro was not the legitimate president of Venezuela and that he was a “fugitive”.\n\nThe Pentagon added that drug cartels will find “no safe harbor.”\n\n“This strike sent a clear message: If you traffic drugs toward our shores, the United States military will use every tool at our disposal to stop you cold,“ chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said.\n\nThe Trump administration has ratcheted up the US military presence in the southern Caribbean as part of what it says is a crackdown on drug smugglers, and ordered the deployment of 10 F-35 fighter jets to a Puerto Rico airfield.\n\nMaduro said early on Thursday his country would deploy military, police and civilian defenses at 284 “battlefront” locations across the country, his latest show of military capacity.\n\n“We’re ready for an armed fight, if it’s necessary,” Maduro said from Ciudad Caribia, on the country’s central coast, in a broadcast on state television flanked by his defense minister.\n\n“Along all the Venezuelan coasts, from the border with Colombia to the east of the country, from north to south and east to west, we have a full preparation of official troops,” he said.\n\nReuters witnesses in several cities around Venezuela did not note an increase in troop presence.\n\nThe US last month doubled its reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro to $50m over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups.\n\nMaduro has always denied the accusations and his government says Venezuela is not a drug producer.\n\nWith Reuters and Associated Press",

      "content": "The conspirators used codenames to conceal their identities as they prepared for their mission: to plunge Brazil into chaos by assassinating a celebrity supreme court judge called Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nOn an encrypted messaging group, one plotter used the alias Brazil, another Japan and a third Austria.\n\n“Each of them had the name of a team,” Moraes said this week as he denounced the alleged plot to murder him as part of an attempt to destroy South America’s largest democracy.\n\nThe group of football-loving would-be assassins abandoned their task at the last minute.\n\n“I’m close to the position. Are you going to cancel the game?” the person codenamed Austria asked their associates on their Signal group at just before 9pm on 15 December 2022, as he lurked near Moraes’s home in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.\n\n“Abort,” replied “Germany”, according to a federal police report.\n\nThe cinematic plot, nicknamed Operation Copa 2022 (Operation World Cup 2022) and involving at least six special forces troops, was at the heart of this week’s historic trial of Brazil’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro. He was on Thursday sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stage a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula.\n\n“[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state,” said Moraes as he accused Bolsonaro of being the leader of a sprawling conspiracy, which included plans to assassinate Lula and the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, to stop them taking power on 1 January 2023.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters at a protest this month. Photograph: Luis Nova/AP\n\nMoraes said hitmen had planned to “neutralise” him using “extremely powerful weapons” capable of piercing his bullet-proof car; they also allegedly considered killing Lula during a public event with poison or drugs that would cause organ failure.\n\n“I’m someone who should be really thankful to be alive,” Lula said last year after the alleged poison plot was revealed.\n\nBolsonaro has denied engineering a coup or being involved in an assassination plot, calling such claims “a little story”.\n\nBut Moraes said there was “ample evidence” indicating the far-right politician was aware of Operation World Cup 2022, which the judge said was part of a larger intrigue called Green and Yellow Dagger.\n\nPolice investigators said a copy of the blueprint for a “clandestine operation” with “terrorist hallmarks” was printed out in the presidential palace on 6 December 2022 by an army general called Mário Fernandes. At the time Gen Fernandes, who was arrested last year, was a senior official in Bolsonaro’s administration.\n\n“This [plan] wasn’t printed out in a cave. It wasn’t printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government … at the same moment that president Jair Messias Bolsonaro was there,” Moraes told the court on Tuesday as Bolsonaro’s trial reached its conclusion.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alexandre de Moraes and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who said he was ‘someone who should be really thankful to be alive’. Photograph: Adriano Machado/Reuters\n\n“The planning is so detailed that it even details the chances of success, what the collateral damage might be, what weaponry should be used,” added Moraes.\n\nA copy of the Green and Yellow Dagger plan, obtained by federal police investigators, suggests plotters planned to use an arsenal that included assault rifles, a belt-fed machine gun and even a Swedish anti-tank weapon, used on the battlefield in Ukraine. “These are weapons of war commonly used by combat groups,” the police report says.\n\nAccording to the investigators, the plan to assassinate Moraes was aborted only because a court session was delayed – and, more importantly, the commanders of the army and air force refused to endorse Bolsonaro’s coup plot.\n\nBrazil has had more than a dozen coup attempts since it became a republic in 1889 but none, so far as is known, involved a plan to assassinate those being deposed.\n\nThe historian Lucas Pedretti said that did not necessarily mean such plots had not existed. Rather, the 2022 plot had come to light because, for the first time in history, the coup plotters had been investigated and put on trial.\n\nPedretti said the existence of the assassination plan was “shocking, but not so surprising”. The historian, who studies Brazil’s brutal 1964-85 military dictatorship, said the armed forces still promoted internally the idea that the bloody regime was a “necessary and legitimate response” to a supposed communist threat.\n\nQuick Guide Brazil's dictatorship 1964-1985 Show How did it begin? Brazil’s leftist president, João Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule. The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974. What happened during the dictatorship? Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”. It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay. But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel. It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures. How did it end? Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy. But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte. Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\n“And this is particularly true in the case of the special forces,” he said, referring to the army group to which the men accused of plotting to kill Moraes, Lula and Alckmin belonged.\n\nPolice believe the men involved in the Moraes murder plot were special forces operatives known as the “kids pretos” or “black cap boys” because of the black caps they wore. Pedretti said the group, set up during the cold war, still maintained the same “enemy elimination mindset”.\n\n“In Bolsonaro’s attempted coup, spearheaded by him and his generals, they simply put that logic and the expertise of the ‘kids pretos’ at the service of the coup-mongering political project,” Pedretti said.",

      "content": "North Korea has executed people for distributing foreign television shows, including popular South Korean dramas, as part of an intensifying crackdown on personal freedoms, according to a UN human rights report.\n\nSurveillance has grown more pervasive since 2014 with the help of new technologies, while punishments have become harsher – including the introduction of the death penalty for offences such as sharing foreign TV dramas, the report said.\n\nThe curbs make North Korea the most restrictive country in the world, according to the 14-page document published on Friday, which was based on interviews with more than 300 witnesses and victims who had fled the country and reported the further erosion of freedoms.\n\nJames Heenan, head of the UN human rights office for North Korea, told a Geneva briefing that the number of executions for normal and political crimes had increased since Covid-19-era restrictions.\n\nAn unspecified number of people have already been executed under the new laws for distributing foreign TV series, including the popular K-dramas from its southern neighbour, he added.\n\n“Under laws, policies and practices introduced since 2015, citizens have been subjected to increased surveillance and control in all parts of life,” the report’s conclusion said.\n\nThe sweeping UN review comes more than a decade after a landmark UN report found that North Korea had committed crimes against humanity. The study covered developments since 2014.\n\nNorth Korea’s Geneva diplomatic mission and its London embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNorth Korea, officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said in response to UN rights investigators that it rejected a UN human rights council resolution authorising the latest report.\n\nSometimes children are made to work in forced labour, including “shock brigades” for tough sectors such as coal mining and construction, Heenan said from Seoul.\n\n“They’re often children from the lower level of society, because they’re the ones who can’t bribe their way out of it, and these shock brigades are engaged in often very hazardous and dangerous work,” said Heenan.\n\nThe report also found some limited improvements, such as reduced use of violence by guards in detention facilities, and new laws that appear to strengthen fair trial guarantees.",

      "content": "Island-dwelling insects have not been spared the ravages of humanity that have pushed so many of their invertebrate kin into freefall around the world, new research on Fijian ant populations has found.\n\nHundreds of thousands of insect species have been lost over the past 150 years and it is believed the world is now losing between 1% and 2.5% a year of its remaining insect biomass – a decline so steep that many entomologists say we are living through an “insect apocalypse”. Yet long-term data for individual insect populations is sparse and patchy.\n\nA new study in the journal Science sheds light on what is happening to insects in some of the world’s most distant places. “There is global concern about the ‘insect apocalypse’, but a lot of uncertainty and debate about what is actually happening,” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at Japan’s Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and co-author of the research.\n\n“We have a new kind of evidence of something we long suspected: that insect species endemic to remote islands are in decline.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A six-spotted tiger beetle (Cicindela sexguttata) in flight in east Texas. About 15% of tiger beetle species in the US are in a state of decline. Photograph: Michael Durham/NPL/Alamy\n\nEconomo and his colleagues analysed genomes of ant populations from the Fijian archipelago gathered in recent decades and held in museum collections. From thousands of specimens, they used scientific methods to infer whether ant populations were growing or shrinking based on variations in DNA sequences among individuals.\n\nThey found that 79% of Fiji’s endemic ant species were in decline, with impacts beginning at the time of humans’ arrival on the islands about 3,000 years ago and speeding up in the past 300 years – coinciding with European contact, global trade and the arrival of modern agriculture.\n\nFor remote tropical islands where comprehensive historical observations are rare, understanding how insects have been harmed by human activities is hard to ascertain but critically important. Islands are hotspots of biodiversity because of their isolation. This also makes them especially vulnerable to extinctions.\n\n“Remote oceanic islands like the Galápagos, Hawaii and Fiji harbour species that evolved in isolation and often have spectacular differences from their mainland relatives,” Economo said.\n\nThe research adds to a patchwork map of findings from the world’s ecosystems. In Germany, the abundance of flying insects across 63 nature reserves has dropped by 75% in less than 30 years. In the US, beetle numbers have plummeted by 83% in 45 years, and about 15% of tiger beetle species there are in decline. Europe’s grassland butterfly population has shrunk by 36% over the past decade.\n\nInsect populations are being hammered from all sides as habitat loss, pesticide use, climate breakdown and light pollution all add to the emptying out of the world’s wetlands, forests and grasslands.\n\n“We need to look at insects in more places, with more methods, to understand what is happening to insects and other invertebrates,” Economo said.\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield in the Guardian app for more nature coverage",

      "content": "Japan has experienced the strongest tornado in its recorded history after a devastating twister tore through Shizuoka prefecture.\n\nClassified as a JEF3, level 3 out of 5 on Japan’s tornado intensity scale, the tornado packed wind gusts of up to 168mph last Friday, injuring 89 people and leaving a trail of destruction. The hardest hit areas included Makinohara and Yoshida, where vehicles were overturned and more than 1,200 structures were damaged. Since records began in 1961, Japan has experienced 13 level 3 tornadoes, but none have reached level 4.\n\nThe tornado occurred as a result of unstable conditions from Tropical Storm Peipah, which made landfall in Japan’s Kōchi prefecture on the same day, striking near the city of Sukomo. The storm unleashed torrential rain and powerful winds, causing damage across the region. Peipah injured 24 people, damaged or destroyed more than 40 homes and knocked out power to nearly 14,000 residents.\n\nBefore the storm, authorities issued evacuation orders affecting more than 600,000 residents, urging caution against flooding and landslides. Shimokitayama, a village in Nara prefecture, recorded 80mm of rain in one hour, while in the city of Kumano 63mm of ran fell within the same timeframe.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hurricane Kiko gathers steam north of Hawaii.

Kiko, which formed on 31 August, had sustained wind speeds of 110mph on Sunday as it dropped to category 2 strength. By Tuesday, the system was officially downgraded to tropical storm status.\n\nKiko veered north of the Hawaiian islands and by Wednesday its remnants hovered near the northern tip of Kaua’i, with sustained winds falling by about 40mph as the storm continued to lose strength. Kiko’s presence is still being felt across the state, though, with forecasters predicting large storm swells, locally heavy rainfall, gusty winds and dangerous rip currents. These hazardous conditions still pose serious risks to surfers and beachgoers alike.",

      "content": "Human rights groups have accused the Hong Kong government of failing to provide the “bare minimum” of rights to same-sex couples after it rejected a bill that was introduced to comply with an order by the city’s top court.\n\nThe city’s unicameral legislative council (LegCo), on Wednesday rejected the bill by a vote of 71-14 after the second reading, following months of debate in the city between opponents who said it threatened family values and advocates who said the government was out of line with the majority of residents who supported same-sex relationships.\n\nThe bill, which would have given limited rights to couples whose marriage or civil union was registered overseas, was in answer to a September 2023 ruling by the court of final appeal. The landmark case, brought by activist Jimmy Sham, affirmed that the city’s laws defined marriage as between a man and a woman, but also said the government was obliged to create an “alternative framework” which recognised the “core rights” of same-sex couples.\n\nThe resulting proposal was criticised at the time by advocates who said it was a “pained attempt” to comply while offering as little as possible. On Wednesday they criticised LegCo’s rejection of it.\n\nAdvocacy group, Hong Kong Marriage Equality, said the veto sent “a troubling signal to both local and international communities – that court rulings may be disregarded and the dignity of individuals overlooked.\n\n“We commend the government for taking initial steps towards fulfilling its constitutional obligation to implement the court of final appeal’s decision on establishing a legal framework for the recognition of same-sex relationships.\n\n“At the same time, we express our profound regret that lawmakers have chosen to ignore clear evidence and public sentiment.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Nadia Rahman said the bill was “flawed”, and would have provided “the bare minimum of protection” only to couples who registered their relationship overseas, but its rejection showed “an alarming disdain for LGBTI rights”.\n\n“It is a setback which shows just how far Hong Kong has to go before everyone in the city can enjoy equal rights,” said Rahman.\n\n“All of our community feel very disappointed, but I still want everybody to have hope because this is not the endgame,” Sham said after the vote.\n\nWednesday’s vote was the first time a bill has been rejected by LegCo since an electoral overhaul by the Chinese government, designed to ensure only pro-Beijing “patriots” could run Hong Kong, effectively removed opposition.\n\nDuring the lengthy debate some legislators said they were voting against the bill because it would affect the foundations of monogamous and heterosexual marriage in Hong Kong.\n\nLawmaker Holden Chow from the city’s biggest pro-establishment party said the bill’s passage would mean opening “a Pandora’s box”, and “subverting Hong Kong’s marriage system between one man and one woman”.\n\nJunius Ho, a firebrand legislator known for incendiary views about the LGBTQ+ community, said the government should never have proposed the bill, and suggested increasing the rights of same sex couples would cause confusion on Mother’s Day and Fathers Day.\n\n“Why do we still need to worry about imaginary troubles and do all this unorthodox stuff? To plunge an entire society into turmoil for a small minority of people?”\n\nAmong the 14 who voted in favour of the bill, lawmaker Regina Ip likened it to a “minimum spending” requirement, given the rights offered were limited.\n\nSecretary for constitutional and mainland affairs Erick Tsang, said the government was disappointed that legislators vetoed the bill, but respected their decision which he said was on behalf of local residents and mainstream opinion.\n\nMeanwhile Beijing officials said the decision proved that LegCo was not a “rubber stamp” parliament, as critics have called it since the electoral overhaul.\n\nPolling has shown the majority of people in Hong Kong support same-sex relationships, and extensive lobbying by LGBTQ+ groups and a series of hard fought court cases have established some piecemeal rights, including those related to public housing, inheritance law and spousal visas.\n\nNick Infinger, a Hongkonger who previously succeeded in an LGBTQ+ rights legal bid, said the community had few other places to turn.\n\n“Judicial review would be the only way that we can fight for our rights … little bit by little bit,” he said.\n\nThe court of final appeal gave the government a two-year deadline, which ends this month. In a statement the government said it wouldn’t apply for an extension, but would “further discuss and study the issue with the department of justice”.\n\nAdditional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu",

Or are they far right thugs,” said one post.\n\nRobinson’s rally comes at the tail end of a highly charged summer in the UK that featured several protests staged outside hotels housing asylum seekers in England, following the arrest of an Ethiopian man who was later convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a London suburb.\n\nBREAKING: far right thugs attack anti-fascists in Whitehall.

      "content": "More than 300 South Korean workers arrived at Incheon international airport on Friday afternoon, ending a week-long ordeal that began with the US Department of Homeland Security’s largest ever single-site raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and has left South Korea questioning whether it can trust its closest ally.\n\nThe 316 Koreans, along with 14 workers of other nationalities, landed shortly after 3pm local time on a chartered Korean Air flight after being detained since 4 September at a Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site in Georgia.\n\nThere was widespread anger across the political spectrum in South Korea at the behaviour of the US authorities, with one newspaper referring to the workers being treated like “prisoners of war” and another describing Koreans as feeling stabbed in the back by their closest ally.\n\nThe workers had requested privacy, and the assembled media kept their distance as the returnees emerged in small groups to board waiting buses. Most wore face masks and carried only small bags; many looking worn out but bearing the weary relief of people whose ordeal had finally ended.\n\nAddressing reporters, the presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, said he had come to offer words of encouragement. “We did our best, but I’m sorry we couldn’t bring them back to their homeland sooner,” he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen South Korean workers freed after days of detention in the US arrive at Incheon. Photograph: AP\n\n“We’re in an age of new normal in dealing with the United States,” Kang said. “The standard changes every time and constantly there has to be deal-making, not only on tariffs, but it’ll also be the case with security issues.”\n\nThe workers had been building a $4.3bn (£3.2bn) battery plant, which is crucial to Hyundai’s electric vehicle ambitions in the US. Most were employed by LG Energy Solution or its subcontractors.\n\nThe detention stemmed from workers using B1 business visas and the 90-day visa waiver programme (Esta) for what US authorities deemed actual employment rather than permitted activities such as meetings or training.\n\nKorean companies have long relied on this “grey zone” because the official H-1B work visas take months to obtain and South Korea lacks the dedicated quota allocations that other US trade partners enjoy. Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice.\n\nThe South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, delivered his sharpest warning yet to Washington on Thursday, stating that Korean businesses would “hesitate to make direct investments” if the US failed to resolve visa issues quickly.\n\nView image in fullscreen A television at Incheon airport on Friday, showing South Korean detainees lined up against a bus after the raid by US federal agents. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty\n\n“Korean businesses that have entered the United States are likely in a state of serious bewilderment,” he said. “This isn’t long-term permanent employment, but to establish facilities and equipment for factories; we need technicians to install machinery and equipment. The US doesn’t have such personnel, and they won’t give visas for [our workers] to stay and work.”\n\nThe workers’ departure from Georgia was delayed by a day after President Donald Trump offered to let them stay and train Americans, but only one person chose to remain.\n\nSouth Korea’s foreign minister, Cho Hyun, flew to the US to meet his counterpart, Marco Rubio, securing assurances that workers would not be restrained while being transported.\n\nThe concession addressed a particularly sensitive grievance after ICE’s release of video footage showing Korean workers being led away in chains, evoking historical experiences of subjugation by foreign powers.\n\nThe episode has generated unprecedented public anger. A survey by the local broadcaster MBC found 68% of respondents believed the US government “did not show consideration for South Korea as an ally” in handling the situation.\n\nKorean media responses were scathing across the political spectrum. Seoul Economic Daily described workers being treated like “prisoners of war”; the conservative Chosun Ilbo called it a “merciless arrest operation” representing a “breach of trust”; while the progressive Hankyoreh asked: “Is this what you do to an ally?” and described Koreans feeling “backstabbed” after Lee’s recent meeting with Trump.\n\nAt the airport, a 75-year-old protester, Hong Jung-sik, reflected a nation’s anger when he said the detention of fellow citizens had left him feeling betrayed. “Trump, who do you think you are?” he shouted, describing the episode as a “national humiliation” and “evil behaviour”.",

      "content": "The Asian Champions League begins on Monday, elevated by a host of star names, including Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nFormer English Premier League stars could make the difference in the Asian Champions League that begins Monday. Ivan Toney, Jesse Lingard, Riyad Mahrez and Darwin Nunez all have a chance of winning Asian football’s premier club tournament.\n\nSaudi clubs dominated last season, providing three of the semifinalists before Al-Ahli won the final in front of 60,000 spectators at Jeddah in May. Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal are also back and expected to challenge again for the title.\n\nSince the country’s Public Investment Fund took over the leading clubs, including Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr, in 2023, Saudi Pro League clubs have spent about $1.5bn on players.\n\nToney signed for Al-Ahli from Brentford in August 2024 and would welcome more success in Asia.\n\n“It was great to win the Champions League in front of our fans, and they are so passionate,” Toney told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nThe England striker scored six goals in last season’s continental tournament and has forged a fruitful relationship with Riyad Mahrez, who won the UEFA Champions League with Manchester City in 2021.\n\n“If you get into the right positions in the area, then great players like Mahrez will find you,” Toney said. “The standard in Saudi Arabia is very high.”\n\nThere are 24 teams in the group stage, split into western and eastern zones in Asia, with the top eight from each progressing to a round of 16.\n\nRiyadh’s Al-Hilal is the most successful club in the tournament’s history with four titles, and was the only Asian team to get out of the group stage at the Club World Cup in June, defeating Manchester City to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl-Hilal has been bolstered by the $70m signing of Uruguayan striker Nunez from Liverpool.\n\nCoach Simone Inzaghi guided Inter Milan to the final of the UEFA Champions League and a 5-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain before quitting in June and moving to Al-Hilal.\n\nThe Italian coach will be hoping to go one better in Asia.\n\nTwo-time champion Al-Ittihad, meanwhile, is looking to Karim Benzema and N’Golo Kante, who have won the European version, to do the same in Asia.\n\nFormer Manchester United and England star Lingard is flying the flag for FC Seoul. The South Korean league is the most successful in Asian club competitions with 12 titles overall, but has produced just one winner since 2016.\n\nLingard joined the K-League team in 2023 and, after a slow start, became club captain and a fan favourite.\n\n“Now, we have to compete in the league as well as the AFC Champions League Elite,” Lingard said. “As captain, I will do my best to help the team achieve good results.”\n\nSeoul FC coach Kim Ki-dong is giving the 32-year-old Lingard more responsibility.\n\n“He has played for England and in the Premier League, but this will be his first AFC Champions League,” Kim said. “I know he’s really looking forward to this, and he’s working hard for it.”\n\nJapanese clubs have offered most of the opposition to Saudi clubs recently. Kawasaki Frontale beat Al-Nassr in the semifinals in April but didn’t qualify this time.\n\nJ-League champion Vissel Kobe may present the strongest challenge, but of the 12 eastern teams, only South Korea’s Ulsan has been a previous champion.",

      "content": "The federal government is making a $12bn “downpayment” on a shipbuilding facility in Western Australia to prepare it for future nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nThe Henderson defence precinct will cost $25bn over a decade and will be used to build surface vessels and to dock and sustain submarines including those to be delivered under the Aukus agreement.\n\nUnder the $368bn Aukus agreement with the US and the United Kingdom, Australia will buy at least three Virginia-class submarines from the US and build at least three new ones in South Australia.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe Pentagon is reviewing the arrangement amid “very serious concerns” about it, but the Washington Post reported on Saturday that the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has told the defence minister, Richard Marles, the deal will go ahead.\n\nMarles met his US counterpart Pete Hegseth, US vice-president JD Vance, and Rubio in August.\n\nWhen asked after the meeting if Aukus was “as good as before”, Marles said “yes”. He said the government welcomed the review, that it was an opportunity to “look at how we can move forward more effectively and efficiently together”.\n\n“It is moving ahead at a pace. It is on schedule, and we are really confident about its progress,” he said.\n\n8:48 Is Aukus a $368bn fix for Australia's problems, or will it create more headaches? – video\n\nThe Washington Post reported there may be “tweaks” to the timeline of the agreement.\n\nMarles will join the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, defence personnel minister Matt Keough and WA premier Roger Cook to announce the Henderson plan on Sunday.\n\n“Henderson will be critical to Australia’s shipbuilding and sustainment industry while supporting continuous naval shipbuilding in WA and Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine pathway,” Marles said in a statement provided under embargo.\n\nThe government said in the statement the commitment of funding to Henderson will give the industry certainty, and will “kickstart early works whilst more detailed planning and design work for Henderson are finalised”.\n\n“This world-class precinct will create more than 10,000 local jobs and strong opportunities for local industry,” Albanese said.\n\n“There is no greater honour than serving our country in our nation’s uniform and my government is dedicated to investing in the defence capabilities our nation requires.”\n\nMarles said the government was increasing defence spending to “record levels”.\n\nThe US is demanding Australia boost its defence spending to 3.5% of GDP.\n\nThe $12bn will be used to build landing craft and “pending successful consolidation”, the domestic share of building a new fleet of frigates. It will also be used for maintenance facilities for warships, and have docking capability for the future submarine fleet.\n\nThe government is still negotiating the details of a $10bn deal with Japan to buy Mogami-class frigates to replace the ageing Anzac-class fleet. The first three will be built in Japan, then up to eight will be built at Henderson.\n\nThe Washington Post also reported that the second “pillar” of Aukus, which is focused on developing advanced technology such as robotics, quantum technology and artificial intelligence, will pivot to developing advanced weapons such as hypersonic weapons and autonomous drones.\n\n“The idea was to focus on advanced stuff that can be in the air and water quickly,” a defence expert told the outlet.\n\nMarles announced $1.7bn for a fleet of Ghost Shark autonomous submarines on Wednesday.",

      "content": "​Brazil’s former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro ​has been sentenced to more than 27 years in prison for plotting a military coup​ and seeking to “annihilate” the South American country’s democracy.\n\nJustices Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha and Cristiano Zanin ruled on ​Thursday that Bolsonaro – a former paratrooper who was elected president in 2018 – was guilty of seeking to forcibly cling to power after losing the 2022 election, meaning four of the five judges involved in the trial had found Brazil’s former leader guilty.\n\nAnnouncing Bolsonaro’s sentence for crimes including coup d’etat and violently attempting to abolish Brazil’s democracy on Thursday night, the supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes said: “[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state … ​the greatest consequence ​[of which] … would have been the return of dictatorship to Brazil​.”\n\nDelivering her decisive vote, Rocha denounced what she called an attempt to “sow the malignant seed of anti-democracy” in Brazil – but celebrated how the country’s institutions had survived and were fighting back.\n\n“Brazilian democracy was not shaken,” Rocha told a court in the capital, Brasília, warning of the spread of “the virus of authoritarianism”.\n\nOn Tuesday two other judges, Moraes and Flávio Dino, also declared the 70-year-old politician guilty of leading what the former called “a criminal organisation” that had sought to plunge the South American country back into dictatorship.\n\n“Jair Bolsonaro was leader of this criminal structure,” Moraes said during a five-hour address in which he offered a comprehensive account of the slow-burn conspiracy against Brazilian democracy.\n\n“The victim is the Brazilian state,” said Moraes, claiming the plot had unfolded between July 2021 and January 2023, when Bolsonaro supporters rampaged through Brasília after the election’s leftwing winner, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, took power.\n\nA fifth judge, Luiz Fux, voted to absolve Bolsonaro on Wednesday, claiming there was “absolutely no proof” the former president had been aware or part of an alleged plot to assassinate Lula and Moraes in late 2022, or had tried to stage a coup.\n\nFux called the 8 January 2023 uprising – when hardcore Bolsonaristas ransacked the supreme court, presidential palace and congress – a “barbaric act” that had caused “damage of an Amazonian-scale”. But the judge, who also controversially argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, claimed there was no proof Bolsonaro was to blame for inciting the riots.\n\nView image in fullscreen Brazil’s federal supreme court minister Carmen Lucia. Photograph: Eraldo Peres/AP\n\nFux did, however, vote to convict two of Bolsonaro’s closest allies – his former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, and his former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid – for the crime of violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy. The judge concluded that the pair had helped plan and bankroll a plot to murder Moraes in order to generate social mayhem they hoped would trigger a military intervention.\n\nThere were leftwing celebrations outside the supreme court as Rocha sealed the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other close allies who were also convicted. They include the former defence ministers, Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos.\n\nBolsonaro’s former spy chief, Alexandre Ramagem, and justice minister, Anderson Torres, were also found guilty, as was Cid.\n\n“Today, Brazil is making history,” Lindbergh Farias, the leader of Lula’s Workers’ party in the lower house of congress, said as he emerged from the building. “Brazil is saying: ‘Coups are a crime!’”\n\nFabiano Leitão, a trumpeter who has spent years using his instrument to criticise Bolsonaro, turned up​ to mark the day of history with a rendition of Chopin’s Funeral March that symbolised the former president’s downfall. ​“It’s the end! It’s the end of this guy!” Leitão​ said as he pulled out his trumpet.\n\nAfter playing the sombre composition, the leftwing musician​ ​launched into a lively samba, capturing the joy many Brazilians feel at the demise of a politician they blame for attacking their country’s democracy, environment and minorities. “The extreme right is a mechanism​ of destruction of countries. It destroys everything: healthcare, science, technology, education, culture. It destroys it all. So this is a historic moment for this county,” Leitão said. “Justice is done, comrades!”\n\nBolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict political persecution and Donald Trump said the conviction was “very surprising”.\n\n“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” said the US president who has spent recent months trying to pressure Brazil’s supreme court and government into halting Bolsonaro’s trial with a campaign of tariffs and sanctions.\n\n“The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt​,” tweeted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, calling the conviction “unjust”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Supporters of Bolsonaro demonstrated in São Paulo on Brazilian Independence Day (7 September). Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nEduardo Bolsonaro, another son of the former president, told Reuters he expected the US to apply further sanctions against officials following his father’s conviction.\n\nIn a post on social media, Brazil’s foreign ministry rejected the statement from US officials, saying “threats like those made today by the US secretary of state Marco Rubio … will not intimidate our democracy”.\n\nThe former president did not attend court this week, remaining in his nearby mansion, where he is under house arrest and police officers have been stationed to ensure he does not flee to one of Brasília’s foreign embassies.\n\nProgressive elation at the downfall of a president blamed for rampant environmental destruction, hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths and attacks on minorities, has been tempered by the realisation that his political movement remains very much alive. Some fear Fux’s questioning of the judges’ authority over the case could open the door to legal challenges and even the trial’s annulment in the future.\n\n“I wouldn’t declare Jair Bolsonaro’s political death,” said Dr Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, who studies the Brazilian right.\n\nRocha expected supporters of the former president to keep fighting to rescue their leader from jail. Likely strategies include trying to elect a large number of rightwing senators in next year’s elections who could impeach members of the supreme court considered Bolsonaro’s foes; petitioning Donald Trump to heap more pressure on Brazil over Bolsonaro’s plight; and trying to ensure that a pro-Bolsonaro candidate beats Lula in the 2026 presidential election. Their hope was that a rightwing president might grant Bolsonaro a pardon, although the supreme court could torpedo those plans, she said.\n\n“I think they’ll continue trying various ways of getting Bolsonaro out of jail and to uphold his leadership and keep him visible,” she predicted.\n\nIn recent weeks, pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers have been pushing the idea of an amnesty for their leader and others who were involved in the coup attempt and the 8 January 2023 riots in Brasília. They claim such forgiveness would help pacify a politically divided country.\n\nBut Fabio Victor, the author of a book about military involvement in Brazilian politics called Camouflaged Power, said he believed an amnesty would serve as an “incentive to illegality”. “It would send an awful signal – it would undoubtedly represent a setback to democracy,” he warned.",

      "description": "Iran says national security council must greenlight any inspections, now limited only to Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant.",
      "content": "Iran says national security council must greenlight any inspections, now limited only to Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nTehran, Iran – Iran’s authorities are discussing what comes next following an agreement with the global nuclear watchdog, as they urge the region to go beyond issuing statements in reaction to Israel’s attack on Qatar.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is heading to an emergency meeting of the parliament’s national security commission on Saturday evening, with hardline lawmakers looking for answers as to whether the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be allowed to access nuclear sites bombed by the United States and Israel in June.\n\nHe is expected to reassure the hardline-dominated parliament that no access will be given to the IAEA without strict permission from the top echelon.\n\nAraghchi had reached an agreement with the IAEA in Cairo, Egypt, on Tuesday, to try to resume cooperation that had been suspended after Tehran accused the nuclear watchdog and its chief, Rafael Grossi, of having paved the way for the strikes.\n\nGrossi told the IAEA Board of Governors on Wednesday that the technical agreement includes “all facilities and installations in Iran” and “contemplates the required reporting on all the attacked facilities, including the nuclear material present”.\n\nBut Araghchi told Iranian state television that agency inspectors have no access to Iranian nuclear sites beyond the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nHe said case-by-case permission would have to be granted by the country’s Supreme National Security Council, which includes the president, parliament and judiciary chiefs, several ministers, military commanders and those appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAraghchi also confirmed that Iran’s high-enriched uranium is “under the rubble of bombed facilities”, and said the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran is investigating and assessing whether the sites are accessible or contaminated.\n\nEurope’s ‘snapback’ and Iranian threats\n\nAmir Hayat Moghadam, a hardline member of the parliament’s national security commission, claimed that Araghchi said Iran will leave the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if United Nations sanctions are reinstated against the country, according to the state-linked Tabnak news website, ahead of the meeting on Saturday.\n\nAraghchi and the foreign ministry have confirmed that legislation is in motion aimed at abandoning the global non-proliferation pact, but that finalising such a move would only potentially come if the “snapback” mechanism of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers is abused by European countries.\n\nFrance, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback mechanism in late August and were slammed by China and Russia, the other signatories to the landmark nuclear accord that the US unilaterally abandoned in 2018.\n\nThe European countries, known as the E3, gave Iran one month to reach a new agreement over its nuclear programme or face international sanctions.\n\nIran maintains that the three would lose legitimacy if they go through with the threat, and will “empower the US and marginalise Europe in future diplomatic engagements”.\n\nDespite the rising tensions, Araghchi announced on Thursday that Iran and France are close to agreeing on a prisoner swap and expressed hope that an exchange would happen “in the coming days”.\n\nIran’s top diplomat did not detail which French prisoners held in Iran would be released, but said the exchange would include Mahdieh Esfandiari, an Iranian woman arrested in France over posts about Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nEsfandiari, a translator living in the French city of Lyon since 2018, was arrested in February, with French authorities accusing her of incitement to and glorification of “terrorism” and “hate speech” against Jewish people over posts on Telegram.\n\nTehran calls her a “hostage”, employing the word used by France and other European countries that have accused Iran for decades of holding foreign and dual-national citizens in relation to espionage charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘Joint operation room against Israeli madness’\n\nFighting off surging pressure from the US and its allies, Iranian authorities have tried to warm ties with China and Russia, and to find common ground with regional players, particularly Arab neighbours, over Israel’s aggressions.\n\nAfter Israel attacked Qatar for the first time this week in a failed attempt to assassinate the top leadership of Hamas, Iran joined the chorus of regional and international condemnation.\n\nAli Larijani, who was appointed Iran’s security chief last month, went further on Saturday and issued what he called a “warning to Islamic governments”.\n\n“Holding a conference of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation filled with speeches without any practical outcome (as happens in UN Security Council meetings) in truth amounts to issuing a new order of aggression in favour of the Zionist entity!”, he wrote on X in Arabic, in reference to Israel.\n\n“At the very least, form a ‘joint operations room’ against the madness of this entity,” Larijani said, adding that “you have done nothing for the hungry and oppressed Muslims in Palestine, at least take a modest decision to avert your own annihilation”.\n\nQatar announced on Saturday that it will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit on Monday in Doha, preceded by a preparatory meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday.\n\nQatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari said in a statement that “the summit will discuss a draft statement” on the Israeli attack.\n\nIran said President Masoud Pezeshkian will represent the country in the summit.",

      "title": "Israel wants us to evacuate al-Shifa Hospital again to kill hope",
      "description": "But we will persist as long as we can to keep this crucial lifeline for Palestinians in Gaza City going.",
      "content": "But we will persist as long as we can to keep this crucial lifeline for Palestinians in Gaza City going.\n\nWhen I walk into the emergency ward of al-Shifa Hospital, I feel like I am back in October 2023, when the shocking number of wounded and dead brought in would overwhelm us every day. I see daily dozens of children, elderly, women and men rushed into the hospital with horrific injuries; many would be missing a limb or an eye.\n\nThe difference is that back in October 2023, we still had medical supplies and fuel for electricity, we were fully staffed, and all of the hospital wards were still functioning.\n\nToday, al-Shifa is but a shadow of its old self.\n\nThe medical complex was repeatedly targeted in the genocide, and substantial parts of it were destroyed. With the efforts of hospital staff, the building of the outpatient clinics was restored and turned into the emergency ward; part of the surgery department was transformed into intensive care for bedridden patients.\n\nSome doctors and nurses returned to work, but by far not enough. We do not have the necessary medical supplies to tackle the constant inflow of injured patients. Electricity keeps cutting off because of fuel shortages, and we are forced to use saltwater for drinking.\n\nThe medical staff are exhausted and starved. Earlier this week, I had an 18-hour shift during which all I had to eat was a single can of tuna.\n\nAmid this horror, forced evacuation is looming over the hospital once again. We work in a constant state of fear of what comes next.\n\nThe atmosphere is heavy, and faces are tense. Patients look to us, the medical staff, for reassurance, while we try to hide our anxiety and hold ourselves together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is difficult to make any preparations for departure, given that we have received no clear information and no instructions about where to relocate. We don’t have enough vehicles to transport the large number of bedridden patients, some of whom are in critical condition, breathing on ventilators, and could die if moved. We have been given no guarantees that if we were to depart, we would be safe along the way.\n\nWe are still trying to make some basic preparations: medical files are being sorted, and lists of transport priorities are being compiled. But these activities are only deepening our despair. Nothing is more difficult than being forced to leave, not knowing where you would go … or how.\n\nThen there is the question of what happens to the communities we serve after we leave.\n\nAl-Shifa remains a vital lifeline for healthcare in Gaza and a last resort for thousands of sick and injured people.\n\nThe only other functioning hospital in the area is al-Ahli, but the conditions there are much worse than in half-destroyed al-Shifa. I went there recently on a visit and saw that there had been a lot of attacks in its vicinity; the sound of bombing was very loud.\n\nIf we are forced to leave al-Shifa, Gaza City will largely be deprived of health services. This would be a death sentence for the people who choose to stay and are injured or otherwise fall ill. It would extinguish the last vestiges of hope people try to cling to.\n\nWe have already been through this horror once before. In November 2023, we received orders to evacuate. We stayed, we were besieged, we ran out of fuel and food. The Israelis stormed the hospital and forced us to leave – hundreds of us, staff, walked to the south.\n\nI did not return to al-Shifa until last month. When I saw the difficult situation inside the recovered area, my heart sank. I was not used to working in such conditions. What made my work even more painful was that I found out that a number of my colleagues had been killed in the 20 months we had been apart. At least three of the female nurses I worked with had been martyred.\n\nAs another evacuation looms, I feel a mixture of fear, anger, and anxiety. This hospital is not just a workplace, but a refuge and a last resort for thousands of people. The thought of seeing it emptied of its staff and patients once again and perhaps destroyed completely is heartbreaking.\n\nDespite all this, we persist. We continue to treat the injured, console them, and cling to what remains of our responsibility. We dress wounds under the light of our mobile phones, perform operations under the sound of bombardment, and deal with death as a daily adversary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe owe it to our patients, to our people, to demonstrate that even in the face of the worst horrors, we will keep going for as long as we can.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

      "content": "The US president said it was ‘shocking’ that members of the alliance continue to buy Russian oil, and also urged the group to place 50-100% tariffs on China to weaken its economic grip over Russia.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has said he is ready to sanction Russia, but only if all NATO allies agree to completely halt purchases of Russian oil and impose their own sanctions on Russia to pressure it to end its more than three-year war in Ukraine.\n\n“I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, which he described as a letter to all NATO nations and the world.\n\nTrump proposed that NATO, as a group, place 50-100 percent tariffs on China to weaken its economic grip over Russia.\n\nTrump also wrote that NATO’s commitment to winning the war “has been far less than 100%” and the purchase of Russian oil by some members of the alliance is “shocking.” As if speaking to them, he said, “It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia.”\n\nNATO member Turkiye has been the third-largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in buying Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n\nIf NATO “does as I say, the WAR will end quickly,” Trump said. “If not, you are just wasting my time.”\n\nAs he struggles to deliver on promises to end the war quickly, Trump has repeatedly threatened to increase pressure on Russia. Last month, he slapped a 50 percent tariff on India over its continued purchases of Russian oil, though he has not yet taken similar actions against China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump’s social media post comes days after Polish and NATO forces shot down drones violating the country’s airspace during Russia’s biggest-ever aerial barrage against Ukraine. Polish airspace has been violated many times since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but never on this scale anywhere in NATO territory. Wednesday’s incident was the first time a NATO member is known to have fired shots during Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the prospect of penalties on states still doing business with Moscow.\n\nIn an interview with US media outlet ABC News last week, Zelenskyy said, “I’m very thankful to all the partners, but some of them, I mean, they continue [to] buy oil and Russian gas, and this is not fair … I think the idea to put tariffs on the countries that continue to make deals with Russia, I think this is the right idea.”\n\nLast month, the US president hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss an end to the war, in their first face-to-face meeting since Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nShortly afterwards, he hosted Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, DC, for discussions on a settlement.\n\nLittle sign of peace\n\nDespite the diplomatic blitz, there has been little progress towards a peace deal, with Moscow and Kyiv remaining far apart on key issues and Russia persisting in its bombardment of Ukrainian cities.\n\nRussia on Saturday said it had captured a new village in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, which Moscow’s forces say they reached at the beginning of July.\n\nThe defence ministry said its troops had seized the village of Novomykolaivka near the border with the Donetsk region – the epicentre of fighting on the front. The AFP news agency was unable to confirm this claim.\n\nDeepState, an online battlefield map run by Ukrainian military analysts, said the village was still under Kyiv’s control.\n\nAt the end of August, Ukraine had for the first time acknowledged that Russian soldiers had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Moscow had claimed advances at the start of the month.\n\nThe Russian army currently controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe Kremlin is demanding that Ukraine withdraw from its eastern Donbas region as a precondition for halting hostilities, something that Kyiv has rejected.\n\nThe Dnipropetrovsk region is not one of the five Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Crimea – that Moscow has publicly claimed as Russian territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said Putin wanted to “occupy all of Ukraine” and would not stop until his goal was achieved, even if Kyiv agreed to cede territory.",

      "content": "Pakistani security forces have raided three hideouts of the Pakistan Taliban armed group near the Afghan border in recent days, triggering fierce clashes that killed at least 19 soldiers and 45 fighters, says the military.\n\nThe military on Saturday said 22 fighters were killed in Bajaur, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Thirteen more were killed in a separate operation in South Waziristan district, it added.\n\nThe statement said 12 soldiers, “having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom” in South Waziristan, their deaths underscoring the struggles Pakistan faces as it tries to rein in resurgent armed groups.\n\nIn another clash in the Lower Dir area, seven soldiers and 10 rebel fighters were killed in a shootout after troops discovered a militant hideout, the army said in a separate statement.\n\nThe Pakistan Taliban, also known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), claimed responsibility for the attacks in a message on social media. The group, which Islamabad says is based in Afghanistan, is separate to but closely linked with the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Pakistan Taliban uses Afghan soil to stage attacks in Pakistan, the military said, urging the Taliban government in Kabul “to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan”.\n\nThe military described the killed fighters as “Khwarij”, a term the government uses for the Pakistan Taliban, and alleged they were backed by India, though it offered no evidence for the allegation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPakistan has long accused India of supporting the Pakistan Taliban and separatists in Balochistan, charges that New Delhi denies. There was no immediate comment from the Taliban in Kabul or from New Delhi.\n\nFrom 10-13 September, thirty five Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. On reported presence of Khwarij, an intelligence based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Bajaur… — DG ISPR (@OfficialDGISPR) September 13, 2025\n\nPakistan has faced a surge in armed attacks in recent years, most claimed by the Pakistan Taliban, which has become emboldened since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021, with many Pakistan Taliban leaders and fighters finding sanctuary across the border.\n\nSaturday’s attack was one of the deadliest in months in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the Pakistan Taliban once controlled swaths of territory until they were pushed back by a military operation that began in 2014.\n\nFor several weeks, residents of various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have reported that graffiti bearing the Pakistan Taliban’s name has appeared on buildings. They say they fear a return to the group’s reign over the region during the peak of the so-called war on terror, led by the United States, which spilled across from Afghanistan.\n\nA local government official recently told the AFP news agency that the number of Pakistan Taliban fighters and attacks had increased.\n\nNearly 460 people, mostly members of the security forces, have been killed since January 1 in attacks carried out by armed groups fighting the state, both in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the southern province of Balochistan, according to an AFP tally.\n\nLast year was Pakistan’s deadliest in nearly a decade, with more than 1,600 deaths, nearly half of them soldiers and police officers, according to the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.",

The earthquake killed 12 people in my community and left 22 others badly injured,” he says.\n\nWinter is coming\n\nIn all, the UN says half a million people have been affected by the quake.\n\nIn this camp, which is lined with tents provided by international NGOs, nearly 5,000 people are sheltering, each with stories of loss and pain.\n\nThankfully, the camp has access to water and sanitation, and there are two small clinics ready to receive injured newcomers, as well as an ambulance which can be dispatched to collect people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, workers are digging a trench to install another water pipe, which will divert water to areas in need around the camp.\n\nJust a few hundred metres away, what were once United States military warehouses have been transformed into government offices coordinating the emergency response.\n\nThe Taliban, which returned to power after US-led forces withdrew in 2021 after 20 years of occupation, has been overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster.\n\nTens of thousands of people are without any shelter at all just weeks before the onset of winter, and the mountainous terrain makes relief and rescue efforts difficult.\n\nNajibullah Haqqani, Kunar’s provincial director for the Ministry of Information and Culture, says the authorities are working through a three-step emergency plan: Evacuate those at risk, provide shelter, food, and medical care in camps, and, eventually, rebuild homes or find permanent housing.\n\nBut the situation is becoming more challenging by the day. “Fortunately, we have received support from the government, local businesses, volunteers and international NGOs. They all came and helped with food and money for the displaced people,” he tells Al Jazeera.\n\n‘The smell of dead animals fills the air’\n\nMore than 10 days after the tremor, new arrivals join the camp daily, inside the fortified walls of the former US base on the banks of the Kabul River.\n\nAmong them is Nurghal, a 52-year-old farmer from Shalatak village who was able to reunite with the surviving members of his family only on Wednesday morning. “From my large extended family, 52 people were killed and almost 70 were left badly injured,” he says. The devastation is “unimaginable”, he adds.\n\n“The weather is cold in our area, and we don’t sleep outside this time of the year. That is why many people were trapped in their houses when the earthquake hit, and they were killed. Everything is destroyed back home, and all our animals are buried in debris. The smell of dead animals fills the air in my village.”\n\nLife before the quake, he says, was stable. “Before the earthquake, we had everything we wanted: A home, livestock, our crops, and land. Now life is in the hospital and tents.”\n\nWomen face particular challenges in the aftermath of this disaster, as Taliban laws prevent them from travelling without male guardians – meaning it is hard for them to either get medical assistance or, in the case of female medical workers, to provide it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) asked Taliban authorities last week to lift travel restrictions for Afghan female aid workers, at least, to allow them to travel to help women in difficulties following the earthquake.\n\n“A very big issue now is the increasing paucity of female staff in these places,” Dr Mukta Sharma, the deputy representative of WHO’s Afghanistan office, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nFurthermore, since women have been banned from higher education by the Taliban, the number of qualified female medical staff is dwindling.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the Taliban leadership says it is committed to ensuring that women will be properly treated, by male health workers if necessary.\n\nHaqqani, Kunar’s provincial director for the Ministry of Information and Culture, tells Al Jazeera: “During the emergency situation, the military and volunteers evacuated and cared for everyone. On the second day, UNICEF set up a medical clinic in Nurghal district and they had female doctors as well. We took as many injured people as the clinic could handle there and they were treating everyone, male and female. In any emergency situation, there is no gender-based discrimination; any doctor available will treat any patients coming in. The priority is life saving.”\n\nAt a field hospital which has been set up inside the old US barracks by the displacement camp at Khas Kunar, six male doctors and one female doctor, 16 male nurses and 12 female nurses are tending to the injured. Currently, there are 34 patients here, 24 of whom are women and children – most of them were taken to Gamberi from their remote villages by Taliban military helicopters and then transferred the last 50km (30 miles) to the hospital by car.\n\nThe hospital’s director, Dr Shahid, who only gave one name, says male doctors and nurses are permitted to treat women and have been doing so without any issue.\n\n‘A curse from the sky’\n\nFrom his bed in the field hospital, Azim, a farmer in his mid-40s from Sohail Tangy village, 60km (37 miles) away, is recovering from fractures to his spine and right shoulder.\n\nHe fears returning to the devastation at home.\n\n“The earthquake was like a curse from the sky. I don’t want to move back to that hell,” he tells Al Jazeera. “The government should give us land to rebuild our lives. My village has become the centre of destruction. My only request is to give us land somewhere else.”\n\nAzim is still coming to terms with the loss of his loved ones. “Yesterday, my son told me that three of my brothers are dead. Some of my family members are in the Kabul and Jalalabad hospitals. And my wife is in Kabul military hospital,” he says.\n\nBack in the evacuation camp, Stoori says he is holding onto hope, but only just.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If God blesses us, maybe we can go back to our village before the winter comes,” he says.\n\n“We have nothing left except our trust in God, and we ask the international community and authorities for help.”",

      "title": "OpenAI's spending spree is powering the tech industry. Oracle is the latest winner",
      "description": "Oracle’s stock surge and Broadcom’s breakout underscore OpenAI's influence across Silicon Valley.",
      "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks to members of the media as he arrives at a lodge for the Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference on July 8, 2025 in Sun Valley, Idaho. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nOracle 's historic stock surge this week marked the latest chapter in the story of a single private company that's dominated the tech landscape for almost three years: OpenAI. In Oracle's blowout earnings report, OpenAI was a key catalyst due to a massive amount of money the artificial intelligence startup expects to spend on cloud computing technology in the coming years. It's becoming a familiar theme. A week earlier, Broadcom shares popped almost 10% after the chipmaker and software vendor said it forged a $10 billion deal to build custom processors for a customer that analysts said was OpenAI. Among tech's megacaps, Microsoft has the closest link to OpenAI, having invested more than $13 billion in the company and serving as its key cloud partner for six years. Nvidia's march to becoming the world's most valuable company is intimately tied to OpenAI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) sit at the heart of large language model development and are essential for running big AI workloads. Those four companies alone — Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft and Nvidia — have seen their combined market caps swell by over $4.5 trillion since OpenAI burst into public view with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. And those gains are a big reason why the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have sustained sharp rallies, with both benchmarks closing at a record on Friday. OpenAI's outsized influence has some market experts understandably concerned. It remains a cash-burning startup that's governed by a nonprofit parent.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe company's $500 billion valuation is supported by a small number of investors betting that OpenAI will prevail in the face of hefty competition from the likes of Meta and Google as well as other highly-valued newcomers like Anthropic and any number of players out of China. \"While we love ChatGPT, OpenAI is still a not for profit limited in its ability to raise capital,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview with CNBC. Luria, who recommends holding Oracle shares, dug into the company's numbers as the stock was in the midst of a 36% jump on Wednesday, its biggest gain since 1992. In its quarterly earnings report late Tuesday, Oracle said it signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers during the period. One of those was with OpenAI, which said previously that it agreed to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity with Oracle. Investors knew, based on a filing with the SEC in June, that Oracle signed a $30 billion cloud contract with an unnamed company that's set to begin in two years. CNBC confirmed a Wall Street Journal report from Wednesday that OpenAI has agreed to spend $300 billion in computing power over about five years, starting in 2027. In the two trading days after its historic pop, Oracle's stock retreated, dropping more than 6% on Thursday and another 5% on Friday, as other investors began sharing Luria's concerns. The new revelations about OpenAI's massive cloud commitment provided a clearer sense of Oracle's expanding backlog. Oracle said its performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, surged 359% from a year earlier to to $455 billion. Luria said the concentration of Oracle's backlog with a single customer \"significantly reduces\" enthusiasm, particularly if \"more than 90% came from OpenAI.\" Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nAltman's open wallet\n\nOpenAI has made big commitments to several other cloud providers, including CoreWeave and Google , and reportedly plans to put $19 billion toward Stargate, a project President Donald Trump announced in January to bolster AI infrastructure investments in the U.S. Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which is separately leading a planned $40 billion investment in OpenAI. Luria said the takeaway is that \"Sam Altman has the gumption to sign very large checks without needing to worry about whether those can ever be cashed.\" OpenAI declined to comment. While OpenAI will be losing money for the foreseeable future, the company is expecting revenue growth to continue at a breakneck pace. After hitting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue in June, OpenAI is on pace for that number to reach $125 billion by 2029, CNBC confirmed. And on Thursday, OpenAI got a step closer to formalizing its transition to a for-profit entity. The company said its nonprofit parent will continue to have oversight over the business and will own an equity stake of more than $100 billion as the commercial entity becomes a public benefit corporation. OpenAI needs the restructuring to take place by year-end in order to secure the entirety of the $40 billion from its latest financing round. For Oracle, the massive increase in OpenAI spending has landed the company within shouting distance of the trillion-dollar club, which currently includes eight tech peers. Oracle's market cap climbed to about $930 billion on Wednesday before retreating to $830 billion to close the week. Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told CNBC's \"Money Movers\" that he's still skeptical of Oracle's prospects in AI. The company has spent years trying to play catchup in cloud infrastructure, where it trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Deeter said Oracle remains a \"B-level hyperscaler\" without meaningful positions in AI software or chips. \"Two days ago, we all thought Oracle was essentially nowhere in AI,\" Deeter said, following the earnings report. \"They announce this mega-deal, people think they're the next great hyperscaler – and I don't buy that part.\" WATCH: Byron Deeter on Adobe and Oracle",

      "description": "While there is an opportunity to improve Performance Food's profitability, the main catalyst here is a potential merger with US Foods.",
      "content": "Business: Performance Food Group is a food and foodservice distribution company that operates through three segments: foodservice, specialty (formerly \"Vistar\"), and convenience. Its foodservice segment distributes a line of national brands, customer brands, and its proprietary-branded food and food-related products to independent and multi-unit chain restaurants and other institutions. Its specialty segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. Its convenience segment distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice related products and other items to convenience stores across North America. It markets and distributes over 250,000 food and food-related products to customers across the United States from about 144 distribution facilities to over 300,000 customer locations in the food-away-from-home industry.\n\nActivist: Sachem Head Capital Management\n\nPercentage ownership: ~2 - 4%\n\nAverage Cost: n/a\n\nActivist Commentary: Sachem Head was founded in 2013 by Scott Ferguson, the first investment professional hired at Pershing Square, where he worked for nine years. Sachem Head has a history of solid value investing, but we believe that they really found their activist stride in 2020 with their investment in Olin . Scott Ferguson took a board seat at Olin - the first public company board seat he took in an investment that was not part of a group - and created tremendous value there. More recently, after nominating a majority director slate, Sachem Head settled for three board seats at US Foods, and most recently settled for a board seat at Twilio in April 2024. Taking board seats signifies both commitment and contribution and this philosophy and style is really paying off for Sachem Head.\n\nWhat's happening\n\nOn Aug. 21, Sachem Head delivered a nomination notice for the following four candidates to stand for election to Performance Food Group's Board at the 2025 Annual Meeting: Scott D. Ferguson, David A. Toy, R. Chris Kreidler and Karen M. King. Additionally, Sachem Head has urged the company to explore a potential business combination with US Foods and, absent a transaction, further improve margins.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nPerformance Food Group is the third largest foodservice distribution company in North America, behind Sysco and US Foods , which all together command approximately 38% market share. The company operates through three segments. The core foodservice segment (61.8% of EBITDA) distributes national, customer, and proprietary-branded food and food-related products. Convenience (20.6%) distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products to convenience stores. Specialty (17.61%) distributes candy, snacks, beverages and other items to specialty vendors.\n\nOn Aug. 21, Sachem Head delivered a nomination notice for the following four candidates to stand for election to PFG's board at the 2025 Annual Meeting: Scott D. Ferguson (founder and managing partner of Sachem Head), David A. Toy, R. Chris Kreidler and Karen M. King.\n\nAdditionally, Sachem Head has urged PFG to explore a potential business combination with US Foods and, absent a transaction, further improve margins.\n\nFerguson and Toy previously served together on the US Foods board as part of a Sachem Head Cooperation Agreement. At US Foods, Sachem Head helped install a new CEO and management team, which catalyzed a successful turnaround for the company. Since Sachem Head filed its 13D at US Foods, the company's stock has more than doubled.\n\nThe other two candidates have just as much experience: Kreidler was the CFO for Sysco for six years and King is an executive vice president at McDonald's and serves on the Aramark board. This is an all-star team of nominees that are well positioned to navigate PFG through operational improvements and a strategic evaluation.\n\nWhile there is an opportunity to improve operating margins at the company, the main catalyst here is the merger with US Foods. The potential synergies that could be attained in such a combination make it very hard to ignore. These synergies are evident from another proposed industry consolidation, Sysco's 2013 attempt to merge with US Foods. Publicly, this deal was projected to deliver annual synergies of at least $600 million within three to four years relative to US Foods' $826 million of EBITDA at the time. In other words, the projected synergies represented more than 70% of US Foods' EBITDA, and the numbers that were thrown around privately were even larger. This is an extraordinary figure, and largely unique to the food distribution landscape and the amount of purchasing, logistics and warehouse rationalization synergies that these companies have. Extrapolating these numbers to a US Foods/PFG merger and applying similar levels of synergies using the EBITDA of PFG's foodservice segment ($1.2 billion), which holds most of the synergistic potential, a merger could be expected to yield $800 million to upwards of $1 billion in synergies. Moreover, if there is anyone who could validate this analysis, it would be Sachem director nominee Chris Kreidler, who was the CFO of Sysco at the time.\n\nHowever, the Sysco/US Foods deal was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission due to antitrust concerns centered around a merger of #1 and #2 that would eliminate Sysco's only national competitor. There are a few reasons why a merger between US Food and Performance Food Group may have a different outcome. First, this would be a merger of the second and third largest players, rather than first and second; and unlike Sysco, PFG is not a national competitor, with little to no footprint on the West Coast. Additionally, today's regulatory environment under the Trump administration is significantly more favorable than it was when the Sysco deal was reviewed under the Obama administration. While any approved deal would likely require divestitures in certain markets and there is no guarantee of an approval, with potential synergies like this, the Board owes it to its shareholders to at least explore the possibility of a US Food merger. And that is all Sachem Head is asking. They are not forcing the company to sell but rather pleading with them to evaluate this potentially lucrative opportunity that has been brought to them.\n\nIn July 2025, US Foods confirmed in an 8-K filing that they had approached PFG about a potential combination. But it takes two to tango and, so far, PFG has not meaningfully engaged with them. Given this current sentiment, sincere consideration of this transaction appears unlikely to occur without asserting a little pressure on the board, and Sachem Head is doing that in the form of a threatened proxy fight that they would have an excellent chance of winning. Not only are proxy fights about the power of the argument, and Sachem Head has a great one here, but the company's shareholder base contains many alternative asset managers that are more likely to support an activist agenda like this than the traditional index funds. These shareholders have a history of being receptive to good activist campaigns and the potential upside this plan could deliver and would also be impressed by the strong slate Sachem Head is nominating should be enough for them to hear the fund out.\n\nMoreover, there is speculation that even prior to Sachem Head's engagement, changes in the C-Suite were imminent. For more than 17 years, the company has been run by CEO George Holm, a widely respected industry leader. Now, it has been rumored that Holm will soon step down, likely to be replaced by the company's President Scott E. McPherson. A CEO transition like this creates the perfect time for a strategic transaction for everyone involved, except maybe McPherson. When two companies of similar size merge in a merger of equals, valuation is often the easy part. It is the social issues that are often the dealbreakers. And that dynamic could be exacerbated when the merger is proposed just as the sitting president is finally getting the call up to CEO. However, McPherson hasn't been a PFG lifer and has only been with the company for a year and a half, so the social issues surrounding leadership of the surviving entity should be achievable.\n\nBoards and their advisors and certain shareholders often viscerally oppose any type of \"sell the company\" activism, and often for good reason. Often, we are the biggest critics of that type of short-term activism that gives the future value creation to a private equity fund or a strategic acquirer instead of the shareholders. But a \"merge the companies\" thesis is different, especially when there are such compelling synergies that create value for all shareholders. A transaction between players of this size would have to come primarily in the form of a stock-based combination, which would allow PFG and US Foods shareholders to participate in the long-term value creation that would arise from the merger.\n\nWe expect that an experienced activist like Sachem Head will be able to convince the board of this and a great outcome for shareholders would be a settlement to add two to three directors to the board along with the establishment of a new committee focused on evaluating strategic alternatives with at least one of the new directors on that committee. That could lead to a transaction that could be a windfall for everyone involved.\n\nBut if ultimately an evaluation is done and a standalone path is determined to be the best outcome, this remains a strong company and a high return on capital business with room to improve on costs and margins around the edges – areas which Sachem Head's directors would also be valuable.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

      "content": "Passengers walk through the entrance of a TSA PreCheck in Terminal One at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Feb. 1, 2017. Armando L. Sanchez | Chicago Tribune | Getty Images\n\nFinding a cheap flight can at times feel as tough as scoring a decent snack on an airplane. But travel experts generally agree on one piece of advice to getting a good deal on airfare: Be flexible. \"It's our No .1 advice, always, for travelers\" looking for deals, said James Byers, head of the product team at Google Flights. Flexibility may mean flying midweek instead of during the weekend, or perhaps traveling outside of peak season for a particular destination, he and other experts said. \"Try not to lock yourself into a really specific date,\" Byers said. Even shifting travel by a day or two in either direction can make a \"huge difference,\" he said.\n\nThe cheapest days to fly\n\nMondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are generally the cheapest days to fly. Tickets are 13% less expensive than those for weekend flights, according to new Google Flights data. Google examined average round-trip airfares from Jan. 1, 2021, through Aug. 1, 2025. It analyzed four-day to 16-day trips departing from the top 4,000 markets in the U.S. Midweek departures are a \"simple way\" to save $42 a ticket, or about 14%, on average, for domestic airfare, according to a 2025 travel hacks report by Hopper.\n\nwatch now\n\nSunday is often the most expensive day to fly, Hayley Berg, Hopper's lead economist, wrote in the report. It's typically a busy day in airports as people fly home from weekends away, she wrote. \"Travelers thinking about a weekend getaway can save significantly by departing mid-week and returning on Saturday or Monday, instead of Sunday,\" Berg wrote. More from Personal Finance:\n\nHow to save on your phone bill when traveling abroad\n\nWealthy Americans are traveling to Europe to dodge tariffs on luxury goods\n\nTSA PreCheck membership still has 'compelling benefits' Of course, holidays can throw a wrench into these guidelines. For example, flying on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving is likely the most expensive day to fly around that particular holiday, said Sally French, a travel analyst at NerdWallet. As an added bonus, skipping weekend travel can also yield big hotel discounts. Checking in on Friday or Saturday and staying through Sunday generally means paying a premium exceeding 20%, or about $50 more per night, relative to the cheapest days of the week to check in, such as Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, according to Hopper data.\n\nDon't fall for this travel 'myth'\n\nCan't afford the hotel? Travelers can pay staff to let them take photos in the pool. Daniloandjus | E+ | Getty Images\n\nMany travelers fall for the \"myth\" that the day of the week on which they purchase their flight has a big financial effect, French said. \"It's not true,\" she said. \"It's not the day that you book [that's important], it's the day that you fly.\" Tuesday has historically been the cheapest day of the week to book, but it's only 1.3% cheaper than Sunday, the most expensive day, according to the Google Flights analysis. \"If I were giving my friends and family advice on what to look for, it'd be lower on the list as a factor,\" Byers said. \"I wouldn't say, 'Wait until Tuesday.'\"\n\nTravel outside of peak season\n\nThese alternative travel trends offer something different than the typical vacation. Alexandr Dubynin | Moment | Getty Images\n\nFlexibility on a more macro level can also help reduce your airfare, French said. \"Just going in a less crowded month can be helpful,\" she said. This might mean traveling during a destination's shoulder season or offseason, experts said. Airfare generally peaks in mid-summer and drops as early fall approaches, Berg wrote. For example, domestic travelers in 2024 saved 40%, on average, or about $150, by shifting from peak summer months to September or October, she wrote, citing Hopper data.\n\nwatch now\n\nOf course, it may be difficult for certain travelers to be flexible. Parents may be tied to summer trips due to school vacation schedules, while workers in certain roles, say, teachers or tax preparers, may be limited in when they can take time off work. Additionally, tours or cruises generally come with rigid start and end dates, and it may not make financial sense to tack on additional days — and extra hotel and food costs — at the beginning or end of a trip, French said.\n\nOther airfare hacks\n\nD3sign | Moment | Getty Images\n\nThere are other ways to save, though, experts said. Layovers, while potentially burdensome, are often a surefire way to save money. Booking an itinerary with a layover saves travelers about 22%, on average, versus flying nonstop, according to Google Flights. Just remember to pack all the essential items for your trip in your carry-on baggage in case your suitcase doesn't make it onto the next airplane, French said.",

      "description": "A popular lip oil is trending on TikTok for potential links to negative skin reactions. Here are some likely causes, and what to look for in a lip oil.",
      "content": "In recent years, lip oils have become more popular among beauty consumers. Similar to lip gloss, the oils give the lips a glossy appearance, but they also double as skincare products that are designed to keep lips hydrated. \"When they're doing the right thing, lip oils promote shine and hydration, and they can even promote plumping of the lips as well,\" says Dr. Rebecca Small, clinical professor at University of California, San Francisco. But ingredients matter, Small says. \"Patients do sometimes report increased pigmentation on their lips as a result of using these products.\" A popular lip oil began trending on TikTok with photos of women showing their lips before and after using the product consistently. The social media users, mainly women of color, experienced intense hyperpigmentation that they allege is as a result of adding the lip oil to their skincare routine. Here's why certain lip oils may be causing hyperpigmentation, and what to consider when choosing a lip oil product.\n\n'You will magnify UV exposure with a lip oil' if it doesn't have SPF in it\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy of lips is an important first step to getting a clear picture of why certain lip oils may cause hyperpigmentation, Small says. The skin on the lips is much thinner than the skin on your face, which makes it more susceptible to dehydration and sun damage, she explains. \"It does not have the same type of UV defense that the rest of our skin has, and it's prone to cancers [and] hyperpigmentation.\" A skin condition that people may be experiencing is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which is when inflammation of the skin leads to increased production of melanin and the darkening of certain areas on the body, Small says. \"If you are using a product that, for example, doesn't have UV protection, you will magnify UV exposure with a lip oil. So if it doesn't have SPF in it, you're more prone to PIH,\" she says. \"And if there are ingredients in the product that are like plumping ingredients, sometimes those plumping ingredients can be irritants.\" Another possibility is that people are developing dermatitis, which is very common after using products that have fragrances in them. \"Dermatitis that's irritant related or allergy related causes your lips or other areas of your body to be red, scaly [and] uncomfortable,\" Small says. It's important to see a medical professional if your lips are in pain, swelling excessively, extremely red or much darker than usual, cracked or bleeding, she notes. And you should immediately stop using any product that you think are causing these symptoms.\n\nWhat to consider when choosing a lip oil",

      "title": "$7 trillion 'wall of cash' worry is looming for investors once Fed interest rate cuts start",
      "description": "Trillions of dollars are parked in money market funds due to years of high rates, but with the Fed poised to cut, portfolio moves will need to be made.",
      "content": "watch now\n\nThis may not be an era in which Americans are awash in physical currency fattening their wallets, but we are awash in cash parked inside accounts that have been generating attractive yields thanks to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to combat inflation. There is a record amount of cash in money market funds, roughly $7.6 trillion, according to Crane Data. But as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut rates for the first time in a year, maybe by as much as 50 basis points — a policy shift that will, over time, reduce the yields on risk-free cash-equivalent investments — market attention has shifted to whether that cash will be on the move. At the most extreme, Wall Street's so-called \"wall of cash\" theory — which claims that all that cash on the move can create its own stock market rally — has been debunked about as many times as it has been offered. At the very least, it is a significant moment of change in Federal Reserve rate policy. The latest jobs market data confirmed mounting fears of a labor market heading in the wrong direction and the need for the central bank to move sooner rather than later before unemployment spikes. Meanwhile, the latest inflation data, while far from an all-clear on pricing pressures throughout the economy, did not suggest the Fed will hold off on at least a 25 basis point rate cut next week. The payrolls data \"cinches the case for a rate cut,\" said Investment Company Institute Chief Economist and lead ETF researcher Shelly Antoniewicz earlier this week on CNBC's \"ETF Edge.\" In line with most market experts and economists, she said the pace of those cuts will remain data-dependent as the Fed watches both the labor market and inflation, and manages its dual mandate of full employment and price stability. But she added on the podcast portion of ETF Edge that as the Fed starts to lower rates, the roughly $7 trillion \"sitting in money market funds\" will gradually flow into more risk-on assets, including stocks and bonds, as savings rates become less attractive. To be sure, more mutual fund companies are going to be chasing those assets on the precipice of a huge decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission which could allow every asset management company to offer an ETF share class of their funds. Antoniewicz noted that there are 70 applications in with the SEC for exemptive relief and the ICI, the main mutual fund industry trade group, is working with hundreds of fund sponsors to be prepared to add an ETF share class if the SEC says \"go.\" While all that may be true, Peter Crane, president and publisher of money fund research firm Crane Data, has heard it all before, at least when it comes to the Fed and money market funds, and he has a simple response: money fund assets just keep growing, and the only times in recent history when they've gone down as opposed to up is when rates are literally at zero during periods of economic calamity.\n\n\"The rates matter but much less than most people believe,\" Crane said. In fact, in the 52-year history of money market funds, assets have only gone down after the dotcom bust and financial crisis, periods where intense economic stress led to rock-bottom rates, a \"bottom of the rate cycle nailed to zero,\" he said. If things get bad enough in the economy that the Fed has to cut more aggressively sooner rather than later, that's not exactly a sign of a market where investors are likely to be overly aggressive with their own risk profile, either. \"Dream on Wall Street,\" Crane said. \"It makes for a good talking point, but the $7 trillion is not going anywhere but up.\" There has also been a shift over time in the usage of money market funds, with what was once mostly a retail investor phenomenon now majority institutional and corporate cash — roughly 60% of the market, according to Crane's data. \"They are not moving, no matter what,\" he said. \"They are not going into the stock market.\" It's not that money fund researchers like Crane deny that lower rates matter, or that some of the money fund assets may indeed move to higher-risk, higher return areas of the market — he thinks that is maybe 10% of the $7 trillion-plus, though he adds there is no precise data to rely on for such an estimate. But when you consider the roughly $20 trillion that Americans leave in bank deposits, basically giving their money to Wall Street to go off and make more money on while earning no money themselves, a 25 basis point cut in the current interest rate environment does not exactly make money funds a dead option. \"It's more about how big is the rate differentially,\" he said. \"A quarter-point to cash investors, looking several years back to when rates were zero and they were used to getting nothing?\" he asked. While investors may get \"re-sensitized\" to yield, at what level will that occur? Currently, money fund investors are earning on average 4.3% annually.\n\nCrane says even if rates move down to 3%, by no means assured since 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts is seen by many as aggressive barring a major downturn in the economy, much of the money will stay put, especially when you consider what banks are paying to hold cash, maybe at best 0.5%. \"Bank deposits wildly underpay,\" he said. That's why Crane believes it will take a repeat of Fed history for a significant amount of that cash to move. \"Likely, if you go to zero there will be erosion in the base,\" he said. The Fed did cut rates a year ago, before it paused due to fears about inflation, and money funds assets have only gone higher since. \"If we go to 3.80%, 3.85%, is anyone going to care?\" Crane said. Additionally, even though the overall balance in the money fund market is huge, individual balances tend to be relatively small. If an investor has $5,000 in a money market fund and it is earning 1% or 2% more or less, Crane says there are better things to think about as far as making money. \"You just spent more money thinking about the problem then you are earning. Nothing is worth doing for less than 1% or one hundred bucks,\" he added. And, at a time when the bond market has been volatile, there is more danger in fixed-income and in the treasuries market than investors had come to expect, making duration a more dicey proposition for investors. Portfolio options as the Fed shifts to lower rates One thing is certain: the money fund market won't move next week in the immediate aftermath of a Fed decision to cut rates. Unlike treasury bills, money funds have a weighted maturity of 30 days, therefore assuming the Fed cuts next Wednesday at its FOMC meeting, treasuries start to go lower but money funds take a month to move fully lower because they are still owners of higher-yielding. older securities. And at least in the short-term, if the Fed unveils a jumbo cut, Crane would expect money market assets to go up for the same comparative reason. \"But over the long term, it is a negative,\" he said. \"Eventually, less interest is being generated compared to other investments.\" But the fact that the market keeps hitting record highs and money fund assets are also hitting record highs doesn't suggest the game is one where whatever benefits stocks hurts money markets.\n\nwatch now",

      "title": "Klarna IPO and ASML's Mistral bet revive Europe's tech dreams",
      "description": "For years, investors have been talking up Europe's potential to build valuable tech firms. Those dreams could finally be moving closer to reality.",
      "content": "Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and Co-Founder of Swedish fintech Klarna, gives a thumbs up during the company’s IPO at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Sept. 10, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nLONDON — It's been a busy week for the European technology sector. On Tuesday, London-headquartered artificial intelligence startup ElevenLabs announced it would let employees sell shares in a secondary round that doubles its valuation to $6.6 billion. Then, Dutch chip firm ASML on Wednesday confirmed it was leading French AI firm Mistral's 1.7 billion-euro Series C funding round at a valuation of 11.7 billion euros ($13.7 billion) — up from 5.8 billion euros last year. Mistral is considered a competitor to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. To cap it off, Swedish fintech firm Klarna on Thursday debuted on the New York Stock Exchange after a long-awaited initial public offering. Klarna shares ended the day at $45.82, giving it a market value of over $17 billion. These developments have revived hopes that Europe is capable of developing a tech industry that can compete with the U.S. and Asia. For the past decade, investors have been talking up Europe's potential to build valuable tech firms, rebuffing the idea that Silicon Valley is the only place to create innovative new ventures.\n\nwatch now\n\nHowever, dreams of a \"golden era\" of European tech never quite came to fruition. A key curveball came in the form of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which caused inflation to soar and global central banks to hike interest rates as a result. Higher rates are considered bad for capital-intensive tech firms, which often need to raise cash to grow. Ironically, that same year, Klarna — which at one point was valued as much as $45.6 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank — had its market value slashed 85% to $6.7 billion. Now, Europe's venture capital investors view the recent buzz around the region's tech firms as less of a renaissance and more of a \"growing wave.\" \"This started 25 years ago when we saw the first signs of a European tech ecosystem inspired by the original dotcom boom that was very much a Silicon Valley affair,\" Suranga Chandratillake, partner at Balderton Capital, told CNBC. Balderton has backed a number of notable European tech names including fintech firm Revolut and self-driving vehicle tech developer Wayve.\n\nGet a weekly round up of the top tech stories from around the world in your inbox every Friday. Subscribe\n\n\"There have been temporary setbacks: the 2008 financial crisis, the post-Covid tech slump, but the ecosystem has bounced back stronger each time,\" Chandratillake said. \"Right now, the confluence of a huge new technological opportunity in the form of generative AI, as well as a community that has done it before and has access to the capital required, is, unsurprisingly, yielding a huge number of sector-defining companies,\" he added.\n\nEurope vs. U.S.\n\nInvestors backing the continent's tech startups say there's plenty of money to be made — particularly amid the economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. For one, there's a clear discount on European tech right now. Venture firm Atomico's annual \"State of European Tech\" report last year pegged the value of the European tech ecosystem at $3 trillion and predicted it will reach $8 trillion by 2034. Compare that to the story in the U.S., where the tech sector's biggest megacap stocks combined are worth over $20 trillion. \"Ten years ago, there wasn't a single European startup valued at over $50 billion; today, there are several,\" Jan Hammer, partner at Index Ventures, which has backed the likes of Revolut and Adyen , told CNBC. \"Tens of thousands of people now have firsthand experience building and scaling global companies from companies such as Revolut, Alan, Mistral and Adyen,\" Hammer added. \"Crucially, European startups are no longer simply expanding abroad — they are born global from day one.\"\n\nAmy Nauikoas, founder and CEO of fintech investor Anthemis, suggested that investors may be viewing Europe as something of a safe haven market amid heightened geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty. \"This is an investing opportunity for sure,\" Nauikoas told CNBC. \"Macroeconomic dislocation always favors early-stage entrepreneurial disruption and innovation.\" \"This time around, trends in family office, capital shifts ... and the general constipation of the U.S. institutional allocation market suggest that there should be a lot more money flowing from ... global investors to U.K. [and] European private markets.\"\n\nProblems remain\n\nDespite the bullish sentiment surrounding European tech, there remain systemic challenges that make it harder for the region's tech firms to achieve the scale of their U.S. and Asian counterparts. Startup investors have been pushing for more allocation from pension funds into venture capital funds in Europe for some time. And the European market is highly fragmented, with regulations varying from country to country.",

      "description": "The report says officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the CDC on shot access and coverage.",
      "content": "Vials with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine labels are seen in this illustration picture taken March 19, 2021.\n\nShares of Pfizer and Moderna fell on Friday after a report that Trump administration health officials plan to link Covid vaccines to the deaths of 25 children.\n\nThe report from the Washington Post said officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.That committee plays a critical role in determining vaccine access, as it reviews immunization data and makes recommendations on who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other duties.\n\nBut the presentation to that panel is not final, the Post reported.\n\n\"FDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, referring to the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\n\"Until that is shared publicly, any this should be considered pure speculation,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nPfizer's stock fell more than 3% on Friday, while shares of Moderna dropped more than 7%. Novavax , which creates protein-based Covid shots, slid more than 4%.\n\nThe report comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S. He has dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women and set new limits on the approval of new jabs against the virus.\n\nIn a statement, Moderna said the safety of its vaccine is \"rigorously monitored\" by the company, the FDA and regulators in more than 90 countries. Systems across the U.S., Australia, Canada and Europe have not identified \"any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women,\" Moderna added.\n\nPfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\n\nResearchers have noted an elevated but rare risk of myocarditis, or inflamed heart muscle, in young men in particular. But there is no evidence that the vaccines in use now cause any other major safety risks, including pediatric deaths. Global surveillance data also continue to generally show that the benefits of Covid vaccination outweigh the risks in pediatric populations.\n\nThe Washington Post said the claim appears to be based on information submitted to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which monitors the safety of shots approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. The system contains unverified reports of side effects, including from patients, doctors and pharmacists.\n\nOnly scientists and public health officials can determine, after thorough investigation, whether a vaccine caused or contributed to a side effect submitted to the system, according to the CDC website.\n\nLast week, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told CNN the agency is conducting an \"intense investigation\" into whether Covid shots have caused deaths in children. He did not share specific data linking pediatric deaths to the vaccine, but pointed to self-reported incidents in the safety system database.\n\nThe FDA plans to release a report in the coming weeks, Makary added.\n\n\"We do know at the FDA, because we've been looking into the [vaccine safety] database of self reports, that there have been children who have died from the Covid vaccine,\" Makary told CNN.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing last week, Kennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people.",

      "content": "Stellantis' Ram 1500 Revolution battery-electric concept pickup truck is introduced during a keynote address by Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavaras during CES 2023 at the Venetian Resort Las Vegas on Jan. 5, 2023.\n\nStellantis ' Ram brand is canceling plans to develop a full-size electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing slowing demand for electric vehicles.\n\n\"As demand for full-size battery electric trucks slows in North America, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will discontinue development of a full-size BEV pickup,\" a company spokesperson said Friday in a statement, using the industry acronym for battery electric vehicles.\n\nStellantis had already delayed plans twice for the truck, which was originally expected to go on sale by the end of 2024.\n\nRam said Friday it would still plan to launch an extended-range electric truck, which is equipped with an electric generator and a gas engine. That truck is expected to come out next year.\n\nThe company said it would rename that extended-range truck from \"Ramcharger\" to the \"Ram 1500 REV.\"\n\nThe change comes as Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis, who unretired from the automaker late last year, has launched an aggressive turnaround for the embattled brand.\n\nNew Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa has been dialing back some of former CEO Carlos Tavares' initiatives and pledged in late July to make \"the tough decisions needed to re-establish profitable growth and significantly improved results.\"\n\nThe auto industry overall has been dealing with slower-than-expected adoption of electric vehicles. The Trump administration has also been looking to unwind many of former President Joe Biden's initiatives to push the auto industry away from gas-guzzling internal combustion engines and has canceled tax credits for buying EVs.",

Morning meal traffic to fast-food chains rose 1% in the three months ended in July, while visits to food-forward convenience stores climbed 9% in the same period, according to market research firm Circana. \"Over the long run, convenience stores have taken share, really at foodservice overall, but the morning meal has been their strong suit,\" David Portalatin, Circana senior vice president and foodservice industry advisor, told CNBC, noting the trend has largely been driven by what the group calls \"food-forward convenience stores.\" For decades, McDonald's and its rivals have tried to lure consumers away from home to eat their early morning offerings, betting that convenience and unique items will win over diners. While fast-food chains have made some inroads, 87% of what consumers eat and drink in the morning comes from their own refrigerators or pantries, according to Portalatin. That leaves plenty of opportunity for fast-food chains — and anyone else who wants a slice of the breakfast pie.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A McDonald's Corp. McGriddle breakfast sandwich is displayed for a photograph in New York, U.S. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBefore the pandemic, fast-food chains started seeing a new rival for their breakfast customers: convenience stores. Regional chains like Wawa in the Northeast and Casey's General Store in the Midwest were expanding their reach and investing in their foodservice options, taking pages from the fast-food companies' own playbooks. For a time, lockdowns and the shift to hybrid work reversed those market share gains. But in the three months ended in July, food-forward convenience stores once again gained the upper hand in the battle to serve consumers breakfast, according to Portalatin. Circana separates food-forward convenience stores like Buc-ee's and Sheetz from the broader industry, although more chains may soon fit under that umbrella. 7-Eleven, the biggest convenience, or c-store, in the U.S., is planning to invest more in its prepared foods business, inspired by the success of its Japanese business. C-store chain RaceTrac on Wednesday announced that it's buying Potbelly for about $566 million, although it's unclear what its plans for the sandwich chain include beyond expanding its footprint.\n\nFast-food's breakfast breakdown\n\nIn recent years, more diners have been watching their budgets, conscious of rising menu prices and a tight job market. Year-over-year morning traffic to fast-food chains has fallen every quarter for the last three years, according to data from Revenue Management Solutions, which advises restaurants on how to increase sales and profits. In the second quarter, fast-food breakfast visits fell 8.7%. To see the struggles, look no further than McDonald's, which dominates the quick-service breakfast category. \"... The breakfast daypart is the most economically sensitive daypart, because it's the easiest daypart of a stressed consumer to either skip breakfast or choose to eat breakfast at home,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call in late July. \"And we, as well as the rest of the industry, are seeing that the breakfast daypart is absolutely the weakest daypart in the day.\" McDonald's morning visits accounted for 33.5% of its traffic in the first half of 2019 but fell to 29.9% in the first half of 2025, according to Placer.ai data. To try to drum up traffic, the chain has included breakfast items in its new Extra Value Meals, including a deal for a Sausage McMuffin with Egg with a hash brown and a small coffee for $5. To reverse breakfast's slide, fast-food chains are taking hints from their competition. After years of convenience stores looking to fast-food chains for ideas on how to grow prepared food sales, from installing ordering kiosks to new menu items, the dynamic has flipped. \"[Quick-service restaurants] are looking at late-night sales and early morning sales, and they are directly looking at convenience stores and saying, 'What is working? How can we bring that to our stores?'\" National Association of Convenience Stores spokesperson Jeff Lenard told CNBC.\n\nThe rise of the c-store meal\n\nwatch now\n\nPrepared foods have offered a lifeline for convenience stores as demand for gasoline, tobacco and lottery tickets has fallen over time. The industry's overall foodservice sales reached $121 billion in 2024, according to data from the NACS. Most customers visit the gas pump during the morning and evening rush hours, on their way to and from work, presenting the perfect opportunity for c-stores to sell them breakfast or dinner. This year, 72% of consumers surveyed by InTouch Insight said they saw c-stores as a real alternative to fast-food chains, up from 56% a year ago and 45% two years ago. Broadly, the c-stores that have focused on fresh food have been winning over more customers. For example, Wawa has seen its customer base grow by 11.5% since 2022, while fast-food chains McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's have seen their combined customer base shrink 3.5% in the same time, according to data from Indagari, a transaction data analytics firm. The majority of 1,170 respondents to an InTouch Insight survey for CNBC said that they have purchased made-to-order breakfast from a c-store in the morning in the past three months. Forty-eight percent of respondents said that when they choose breakfast from a convenience store, they are replacing a visit that they might otherwise make to a fast-food restaurant like McDonald's or Dunkin'. Buying coffee and breakfast from a c-store likely won't be cheaper than making it at home. But consumers perceive it as \"good bang for their buck,\" according to Sarah Beckett, vice president of sales and marketing for InTouch Insight. Plus, c-store customers get a wider breadth of options. In addition to coffee, gas stations sell energy drinks, protein shakes and yogurt smoothies. And customers can pick up a granola bar or banana to accompany their breakfast sandwich. Fast-food chains lack that kind of variety. But above all, what matters to consumers is the food itself. \"While [a] convenience store broadly does have some tailwind from being a lower price point, the ultimate differentiator, and what's really going to set apart the winners from losers, is that quality aspect of it,\" Circana's Portalatin said.\n\nSignage at a Casey’s General Store.

      "description": "For Panama Canal, drought is an economic and existential risk. New dam and land bridge projects will help trade move, but won't be ready before next El Niño.",
      "content": "After a historic drought that paralyzed vessel transits through the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Authority is moving ahead with major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate future droughts and the risk of low water levels that in recent years plagued the key global trade gateway.\n\nThe Panama Canal depends on fresh water for its operations and is rainfall dependent.\n\n\"We use about two and a half times the amount of water a city of the size of New York uses for the canal operation,\" Ricaurte Vásquez, Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC.\n\nIn a good year of rain, that means over 50 vessel transits through the canal's locks a day, but in recent years, weather has not cooperated. Severe drought conditions hit the region from late 2022 to 2024, forcing the canal to reduce transits and put in place vessel weight restrictions in an effort to conserve water.\n\nThe canal is critical to the U.S. economy and trade. The U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal, with total U.S. commodity export and import containers representing about 73% of Panama Canal traffic, and 40% of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year. In all, roughly $270 billion in cargo is handled annually.\n\nIn April, Canal administration began the pre-qualification and selection process for concessionaires to build a land bridge, including what it describes as a flagship natural gas pipeline line to move natural gas liquids (NGLs) without relying on the canal itself. A road connecting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as port terminals built on either coast, would also be constructed, with the terminals also able to accommodate containers and roll-on and roll-off cargo.\n\nThe pipeline would allow for the transport of liquified petroleum gas, ethane, butane, and propane from the Atlantic side to a Pacific-side terminal, where another vessel would be loaded and carry the product to Asia. Canal officials hope this will attract more LNG transits through the canal.\n\nThe Panama Canal Authority reported a 29% drop in vessel transits during fiscal year 2024, with the biggest hits in LNG and dry bulk transits. LNG transits were down 66 percent, while dry bulk transits were down 107 percent.\n\nEven though water levels are back to regular operating conditions, LNG traffic has not returned to pre-drought transit activity, with carriers continuing to choose the longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, according to S&P Global data.\n\nVasquez tells CNBC that U.S. energy companies are \"drooling at the possibilities\" of this alternative way to move the commodity. Transit time-wise, Vasquez said the pipeline would be competitive versus traversing the canal, and reliability would be higher because it is now water-dependent. \"This is important because with many of these products, reliability and delivering on time are critical,\" he said.\n\n\"We decided to do a land bridge to complement the waterway,\" Vásquez said. \"We are aware that these are high-value products that have a destination in Asia,\" he said, noting the project was announced in Tokyo, which is the largest buyer of these energy products.",

      "content": "In this article UNH\n\nBRK.A\n\nBRK.B Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nWarren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. CNBC\n\n(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday in your inbox.) UnitedHealth Group shares have soared almost 30% since Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure in mid-August that it had purchased a bit more than 5 million shares between April 1 and June 30. Minutes before that SEC filing, UNH closed at $271.49. On Friday, it ended trading at $352.51. Although UNH had already started to bounce from its lowest close of the year of $237.77 on Aug. 1, Berkshire's endorsement of the troubled stock is responsible for at least a sizable chunk of its recent gains.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nIt is not clear, however, whether Berkshire's investment is profitable (on paper) at this point. The current price is up just 13.0% since its $311.97 close at the end of Q2 on June 30. We don't know exactly when Berkshire did its buying during the second quarter, so we can only look at a range of possible purchase prices. (And, of course, it may have continued to buy in the third quarter. We won't know about that until mid-November.)\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nAt Q2's high of $606.36 per share, Berkshire would have paid $3.1 billion for its stake, putting it 42% into the red. At the low of $248.88, the 5 million shares would have cost less than $1.3 billion, giving it a 42% gain. Using the average close for the period, the price comes in at $1.9 billion. Today's value of $1.8 billion is around 8% below that level. Since Berkshire's buying was presumably triggered by the price slide early in the quarter, the actual purchase price is probably at the lower end of the range, but there still appears to be a significant chance the stake is the red, despite the stock's recent gains.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on April 21, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBerkshire & Co., however, are usually in it for the long haul, and there are some bullish signs for the stock, which is still down 30% year to date. After meeting with UNH's management, analysts at Morgan Stanley said, \"We are incrementally positive following discussions with UNH [management] where it had conviction in the turnaround.\" On Friday, Morgan Stanley's Erin Wright raised her price target to $395 from $325. And on Tuesday's \"Lightning Round,\" CNBC's Jim Cramer said he doesn't like to buy stocks that are under investigation, but \"there are some people who seem to know that the worst is over.\"\n\nKraft Heinz slips as Berkshire overhang looms\n\nThe outlook for a larger Berkshire stake, however, isn't as good. Kraft Heinz shares fell another 4.25% this week after dropping more than 2% last week in the wake of its plan to split back into two companies, essentially reversing the 2015 merger that Warren Buffett helped organize.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nIn an unusual move for the normally passive investor, Buffett told CNBC he's \"disappointed\" the company went ahead with those plans, even though it knew he, representing KHC's largest shareholder, opposed a split. CNBC.com's Yun Li quotes Gordon Haskett's Don Bilson as saying, \"Beyond any worries that investors might have with the plan itself, they must also grapple with the possibility that Buffett will now dump his stock.\" Because its stake is more than 10%, any sales would have to be reported publicly within two business days.\n\nBuffett drops four notches on new Forbes 400 ranking\n\nWarren Buffett is #9 on the just-released 2025 Forbes 400 list of the richest people in the United States. That's down from #5 last year even through his estimated net worth remained unchanged at $150 billion.\n\nWarren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.

      "title": "From bananas to toys, these 5 charts show how much costs have risen since Trump's tariffs went into effect",
      "description": "Since Trump’s tariffs took effect in April, inflation has been showing up in categories that rarely see big swings.",
      "content": "Inflation has picked up since President Donald Trump announced new import tariffs in April, with the latest consumer price index data showing outsized increases in tariff-sensitive categories, including coffee, toys and televisions. Overall prices rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.7% in June and July, according to CPI data released Thursday. The CPI measures the cost of a broad basket of everyday goods and services, including groceries, rent and medical care.\n\nThat leaves inflation drifting farther from the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4% in August, the biggest monthly gain since January, and is up 3.1% from a year earlier. Taken together, this means more pressure on everyday household spending.\n\nHow tariffs feed into inflation\n\nAlthough Trump's sweeping tariffs were first announced in April, the effects have shown up unevenly since goods move through supply chains at different rates and imports make up a larger share for some products than others. Even so, they still have a \"significant impact on prices,\" according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Take bananas, for example. Prices climbed 4.9% from April through August — equivalent to an annualized pace of about 15% — a notable jump for a category that rarely sees much inflation. Virtually all U.S. supply comes from Central and South America and is now subject to a 10% tariff. Bananas aren't the only industry affected. The Fed's Beige Book survey in August said all regions were seeing tariff-related price increases, spanning sectors from food and retail to manufacturing and health care, with many businesses reporting they've started to pass those costs on to consumers. Overall, Americans now face an average tariff rate of 17.4% — the highest since 1935 — an increase estimated to cost households an extra $2,300 in 2025, according to the Yale Budget Lab. (These estimates include tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which remain in place while the court challenge is pending). To get a sense of where else inflation has been heading, here's a look at five of the most-impacted products since April, compared with their historical norms for the same time period over the last 10 years.\n\nCoffee\n\nCoffee prices jumped 9.8% from April to August, including a 3.6% spike last month. Poor harvests earlier this year had already tightened supply, but prices rose dramatically faster after new import tariffs took effect. Since the U.S. grows less than 1% of the coffee it consumes, the market is especially exposed to import duties. Global tariffs that started at 10% in April were later raised sharply on major suppliers like Vietnam and Indonesia. Brazil — which supplies more than a third of the U.S.'s arabica beans — was hit with a 50% duty on Aug. 6. That late move could keep coffee prices climbing in the months ahead, industry groups say.\n\nJewelry and watches\n\nJewelry and watch prices surged 5.5% in August, far above their historical average monthly gain of 0.8%. The U.S. relies heavily on imports for luxury jewelry and its components, and since April a 10% tariff has been broadly applied to this category. But rates have gone higher still. On Aug. 7, the U.S. raised tariffs on all Swiss imports — including watches — to 39%, far above the baseline. Switzerland supplies more than 90% of the U.S.'s imported precious-metal wristwatches, per the Wall Street Journal. The U.S. has also extended tariffs to India, a leading supplier of cut and synthetic diamonds, and to Japan, which exports premium mechanical watches to the U.S. Those additional levies could push jewelry and watch prices higher in the coming months.\n\nBananas\n\nNormally a stable category in the CPI, bananas saw an unusually sharp 4.9% increase between April and August. With virtually all supply imported from Central and South America, the U.S. market is directly exposed to tariffs, including the 10% across-the-board duty imposed in April. Bananas remain cheap compared with most fruits and vegetables, with a reputation for long-running price stability. Reflective of that stability, Trader Joe's held its banana price at 19 cents each for more than two decades, only raising it to 23 cents in early 2024.\n\nTelevisions\n\nTelevision prices edged up 2.5% in August and are up 3.1% since April. While the increase might seem modest, television prices have been on a downward trajectory since the late 1990s. Manufacturing efficiencies and the rise of \"smart\" TVs that generate revenue from advertising and data collection have helped drive sticker prices lower. Nearly all TVs sold in the U.S. are imported, mainly from Mexico, China and Vietnam. Imports from Mexico can face tariffs of up to 25%, depending on compliance with USMCA rules, while some shipments from China face rates as high as 30% and Vietnamese TVs generally face a 20% duty. The summer run up in prices stands out as a break from the usual pattern for a product that typically gets cheaper over time.\n\nToys",

      "description": "\"The lessons we took from this adventure still inspire how we live today,\" says Jen Glantz, founder of Bridesmaid for Hire.",
      "content": "When my boyfriend asked to move in with me in 2017, I said no. We'd been dating for a year, and both of our New York City leases were about to expire. We'd save so much money if we lived in just one place, he said. But I panicked. Our lives felt so boring. We were on track to follow the traditional relationship playbook. Next we'd get married, then we'd have kids, and before we knew it, our iron-clad routines would guide us straight to a retirement home. Instead, I argued, we should do something different. We sold 90% of our belongings, stored the rest in his parents' basement, and moved to a new city every month (sometimes staying longer and occasionally repeating a destination). For two years, we found short-term rentals through Craigslist, Facebook groups, and Airbnb. We lived in 10 cities total, including Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and Austin. Now we're back in Brooklyn. We're married and have a daughter. But the lessons we took from this adventure still inspire how we live today.\n\nWe realized what really matters\n\nI always placed sentimental value on my stuff. It was hard for me to give away clothes that no longer fit or get rid of books, letters, and other keepsakes. But in order to travel around the country easily, we each brought just one checked bag and one carry-on suitcase. We packed up items like winter coats and family memorabilia and left them with my husband's parents. The rest of our stuff we donated, tossed, or sold.\n\nJen Glantz and her husband in Austin. Courtesy of Jen Glantz\n\nIt was hard in the moment to say goodbye to so much. Every now and then, I wished I still had an item or two of clothing that I gave away or a stack of birthday cards I'd tossed. But those feelings faded fast. When we moved back to Brooklyn to start a family, I became an ultra-minimalist. I rarely bought new things and found myself cleaning out closets and drawers a few times a month to make sure we weren't holding on to things for no reason. The less stuff I crowd my space with, the better I feel.\n\nWe had to shake up our routines\n\nBefore we did this, we walked the same path home every day from work, ate at the same places on rotation, and alternated between two or three weekend activities. But when we started living in new places, we didn't have a chance to form routines. We were so eager to see as much as we could that we purposely never walked or drove the same route to get to places, and we made a rule that we couldn't eat at any restaurant more than twice. At first, it was uncomfortable. But it forced us to try new things, from surfing to going on a date at a state fair. While this is harder to implement on a daily basis now, we create seasonal bucket lists of things we want to do in New York City, plan a unique date night every month, and switch up our weekend dinner spots.\n\nWe learned to live on less\n\nWhile it might seem like a financially irresponsible decision to ditch your home and travel all over the country, we actually saved money along the way. In New York, we were both paying for our separate living spaces. Plus, our monthly expenses included gym memberships, impulse buys, and more.\n\nJen Glanz and her husband in Chicago. Courtesy of Jen Glantz\n\nWhen we traveled, we shopped less. We didn't have space for new clothing or knickknacks, and found low-cost rentals that we shared. We invested more money in mutual funds and in the stock market so that when we finally moved back to Brooklyn, we were able to afford rent on a one-bedroom apartment that otherwise would've been out of our price range. By that time, we were used to living with less, and we started following a budget that helped us continue to save.\n\nWe really get to know each other (and ourselves) really well",

Corning has had a relationship with Apple for years — the manufacturer's glass has been used in iPhones since its first iteration in 2007.\n\nCook pointed in particular to the strength of Corning's \"ceramic shield\" technology, which he said is thin and light, but also durable.\n\nAccording to Corning CEO Wendell Weeks, the new version of the ceramic shield is 50% stronger than the first version. Weeks also spoke with Cramer and Cook on Friday, and he said Apple's investment would boost the factory's workforce by 50%.\n\n\"This is going to become the world-leading manufacturing site for production of highly-specialized glass,\" Weeks said. \"We're going to triple production.\"\n\nTo Cook, domestic manufacturing can help create \"a hub of economic activity in different places,\" saying that factories themselves create jobs but also bolster local businesses. Weeks agreed and suggested Corning views its business as a \"social contract\" with the community. He spoke about the Kentucky plant's evolution in innovating glass since it opened in 1952.\n\n\"When you walk around the factory, you'll meet people who, they're third generation Corning employees in this factory,\" Weeks said. \"But what the people today are doing has nothing to do with what their grandfather did.\"",

      "title": "Week in review: How we navigated the strong market ahead of the big Fed meeting",
      "description": "A mixed bag of economic data, along with a blowout earnings report from a Big Tech name, paved the way for the market's weekly gains.",
      "content": "It was a stellar week for stocks as Wall Street speculated on the Federal Reserve's upcoming and highly anticipated interest rate decision and what comes next. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq each hit multiple record highs since Monday. A mixed bag of economic data, along with a blowout earnings report from Oracle , paved the way for the market's gains as central bankers prepare for their two-day policy meeting that concludes on Sept. 17. The Nasdaq closed at a record on Friday. The S & P 500 finished slightly lower after reaching new intra-day highs earlier in the day. For the week, the S & P 500 gained 1.6% and the Nasdaq rose 2%. Late Tuesday, Wall Street first fixated on Oracle's astonishing fiscal 2026 first quarter report . Management shared that the company's remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, skyrocketed 359% from the year prior. Oracle stock closed at a record high Wednesday, jumping nearly 36% in the session that followed the release. Shares lost steam on Thursday and Friday, but still managed a weekly gain of 25.5%. The release raised more than just Oracle's stock price. Shares of chipmakers like Club holdings Nvidia and Broadcom jumped in tandem as the software vendor's huge cloud backlog signaled continued demand for AI infrastructure. Nvidia and Broadcom shares rose 4% and 10%, respectively, on Wednesday, and nearly 6.5% and almost 7.4% for the week. Economic data was also a big focus for investors this week. On Wednesday, investors grew more confident of an interest rate cut after the producer price index (PPI), a key wholesale inflation measure, fell more than expected in August. PPI, which tracks input costs across an array of goods and services, declined 0.1% last month. That's compared to a Dow Jones estimate of a 0.3% increase. As a result, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq finished Wednesday's session at records. Thursday complicated matters for policymakers, however, after prices for consumers accelerated more than expected in August. The consumer price index (CPI), a widely followed gauge of retail inflation, recorded a seasonally adjusted 0.4% increase for the month. That's the biggest CPI gain since January and surpassed Dow Jones estimates of a 0.3% rise. During that same session, weekly jobless claims came in at their highest level in almost four years. This showed signs of further softness in the U.S. labor market and potential cracks in the country's economy, leaving the door open for the Fed to lower rates more aggressively into the end of the year. Despite the murky readings, the jobs report seemed to overshadow CPI as traders priced in a great probability of a reduction for the first time since December 2024. .SPX .IXIC YTD mountain S & P 500 (SPX), Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) year-to-date performances The Club capitalized on the market's moves with five trades since Monday. The Club bought Boeing twice this week. On Monday, we initiated a position in the aerospace giant after last month's exit of Coterra Energy left us with an opening in the portfolio. The Club bought more Boeing on Friday as shares continued to decline. When starting a new position, we recommend that each additional purchase be at a lower price point than the previous one. That will help reduce the overall weighted average cost basis. The Club invested in Boeing, in part, because the Trump administration's trade policies and subsequent tariff deals should strengthen demand for jets. The Club set a price target of $275 apiece on the stock, representing 27 % upside from Friday's close. On Tuesday, we trimmed some of our Goldman Sachs position into strength as shares reached record highs. The sale, however, does not reflect any change in the Club's thesis. We used the cash proceeds to purchase more Texas Roadhouse . Shares of the steakhouse chain have declined significantly since its earnings report in early August – a reaction we view as overdone. Shares saw weekly gains of nearly 5.7%. The Club bought more Honeywell shares Thursday in hopes that the Fed's expected cuts will translate into a pickup in the economy, which would lead to more manufacturing and demand for the industrial conglomerate's offerings. Plus, it's a good time to buy as Honeywell stock has lagged compared to its peers in the runup to its split into three publicly traded companies. Some on Wall Street call this \"spin purgatory ,\" and it often has little to do with underlying fundamentals. The stock lost more than 1% for the week. WFC GEV YTD mountain Wells Fargo (WFC), GE Vernova (GEV) year-to-date performances Additionally, we took note of commentary from top executives at two of our portfolio companies: Wells Fargo and GE Vernova . On Tuesday, Wells Fargo CFO Mike Santomassimo shared positive mid-quarter updates that included a big increase in share repurchases. Wells has bought $5.5 billion of its stock quarter to date, according to the executive, more than the firm's purchased in other quarter this entire year. To us, that's a sign that management's upbeat on both the firm's capital levels and its earnings outlook. Santomassimo also added that Wells is seeing \"really good green shoots\" this quarter now that its $1.95 trillion asset cap has been removed and the bank goes on the offense. The CFO pointed to more revenue growth, for example, in its asset and wealth management businesses. \"We started to change the company and really pivoted towards the businesses that we think have the best opportunity over the long run,\" Santomassimo said at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference. Shares, however, closed slightly lower Tuesday. This was likely due to profit-taking after Monday's run and not with company fundamentals. For the week, Wells stock gained more than 3%. After that, GE Vernova stock sank 1.5% Thursday following CEO Scott Strazik's mixed remarks at the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference. Strazik said that onshore wind orders, which is a part of GE Vernova's smallest business segment, remain soft and projected a decline in revenues in 2026 compared to 2025. This isn't entirely unexpected, given the Trump administration's critical stance on wind energy. Still, the CEO did seem upbeat on the demand for power – which is great news for a company that makes turbines used in the generate electricity. \"Not only is the world going to need more energy, but the proportion of that energy that's going to be coming from electrical power is going to grow.\" Shares of the industrial name ended the week 7.4%% higher. AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Club holding Apple on Tuesday showcased its refreshed iPhone 17 lineup and other devices at the company's annual hardware event. Shares fell 1.5% that session as some investors viewed the product updates – like longer battery life and better camera technology – as more evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Many wanted more material announcements regarding the company's artificial intelligence suite, Apple Intelligence. The stock lost 2.3% for the week. Jim disagreed with the lackluster reception to the latest iPhone lineup. \"Wall Street's got it wrong. There are a lot of amazing things in this one versus this one,\" Jim said Friday, also pointing to the new iPhone Air and some price increases. That being said, Apple's generative AI rollout is still crucial to the company's future success. \"Ultimately, Apple still needs to deliver on its Apple Intelligence offering if we are going to see any dramatic acceleration in the upgrade cycle for its most important product: the iPhone,\" Zev Fima, a portfolio analyst for the Investing Club, wrote in an analysis of the event. \"The good news is that Tuesday's updates certainly keep the Apple product line fresh and attractive, providing the time needed to nail down that AI strategy.\" (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

      "title": "Exit 8’s director was inspired by watching people play the game",
      "description": "Few video game adaptations understand their source material quite like the Exit 8 film.

      "content": "Few video game adaptations understand their source material quite like the Exit 8 film. It takes the rules and structure of the game — which strands players inside of a looping hallway in a Tokyo subway station — and then builds on them with actual characters and a story. And according to director Genki Kawamura, one of the reasons that the movie feels so fresh could be because of how he approached it. “I wasn’t necessarily thinking about a film adaptation of a video game,” he tells The Verge. “I was thinking about how to create a new cinematic experience that blurs the lines between video game and cinema.”\n\nThe two are very similar, and the film even starts out with the game’s first-person perspective. And like the game, the movie features a person stranded inside of a hallway that repeats itself, and the only way to get out is to spot “anomalies” — basically, weird shit that changes in each loop — and then switch directions. Kawamura says that he discovered the game because he plays a lot of indie titles, and he was immediately attracted by just how much like Tokyo the space felt. But he also realized the premise could make for a much more universal story. “I felt like a lot of people who live in cities have had that experience of getting lost in a passage like that,” he explains. “I felt like combining the Tokyo design and the very universal experience could create something cinematic.”\n\nBut turning the game, which has no characters or story and lasts less than an hour, into a movie required adding a lot of elements. The main character, known only as the Lost Man (Kazunari Ninomiya) is struggling with both keeping a job and the potential of becoming a father when he encounters the strange, looping hallway. While there, we meet other characters, including the Walking Man (Yamato Kochi), who starts out as a source of terror, along with a young woman (Nana Komatsu) and small boy (Naru Asanuma), who are similarly trapped. There are also new anomalies that weren’t in the game, and Kawamura says the idea was to create unsettling moments that related to the outside world. For Ninomiya’s character, for instance, this means some pretty creepy baby-related sound design.\n\nImage: Neon\n\nOne of the most interesting things about the film is how each character approaches the rules of the hallway, which require carefully inspecting the surroundings before deciding whether to walk forward or backward. Some take their time, some rush, and they all look at things in a different order. It’s a bit like watching different people play the game — which was exactly the intention.\n\nKawamura says he had a discussion with Shigeru Miyamoto, in which the famed Super Mario and Legend of Zelda creator told him “a good video game is fun to play but it’s also fun to watch somebody play.” So some of the inspiration for the characters came from places like YouTube, where the creative team watched playthroughs of the game to see how players approach and react to things. “Everyone is playing by the same rules and in the same space, but each player makes different mistakes, and they have different reactions to each failure,” Kawamura says. “And I thought that because of that, the personality of the individual player comes to the surface.”\n\nIf you have played the game, watching Exit 8 is a surreal experience. It takes place in a space you already understand intimately, and then twists it in new and uncomfortable ways. Kawamura had a similar experience on the set itself. The hallway was built on a sound stage and consisted of two corridors — nicknamed Hitchcock and Kubrick — connected by a small pathway dubbed Mizoguchi. Kawamura says this structure allowed the team to create long, continuous shots that made it seem like the hallway was looping. The idea was to confuse viewers — though the filmmakers weren’t immune.\n\n“It was a good tool to disorient the audience,” he explains. “Even we got confused about where we were on set during the shoot.”\n\nExit 8 is expected to hit theaters in early 2026.",

      "content": "If you listen to music the way a lot of people do these days — with a pair of wireless earbuds, from a Bluetooth speaker, or just blaring directly out of your phone — you will never notice a difference between Spotify’s high-quality 320Kbps streams and its lossless audio. But, if you usually listen with wired headphones while working at your desk, or have a quality speaker from the likes of Bose that supports Spotify Connect, there actually is something to be gained here.\n\nComparing Spotify’s normal quality streams (96Kbps) with the new 24-bit / 44.1kHz lossless FLAC files feels unfair. Even a relatively untrained ear should be able to hear the difference. While compression technology has improved a lot since the days of crunchy Napster MP3s, there is still a noticeable loss in quality at 96Kbps. High frequencies especially can seem muddy and distorted.\n\nEven just jumping from normal quality to high quality (320Kbps) results in a very noticeable difference. But going beyond that to lossless, or even hi-res lossless on a competing service like Tidal, yields diminishing returns. I’d venture to guess that most people will be unable to tell the difference between Spotify’s high-quality streams and lossless under a lot of circumstances. If you’re listening to a hip-hop song that samples crackly vinyl, a metal record with heavily distorted guitars, or a dance single with a kick drum that’s been compressed into oblivion, it can be hard to pick out the differences. It’s not that they’re not there — Kendrick Lamar’s vocals cut through the mix more on “squabble up,” and Sudan Archives’ heavily processed violin on “DEAD” feels more lively — but they can be easily lost in the bombast.\n\nWhere lossless can make a big difference compared to Spotify’s standard high-quality setting is with gentler styles of music that feature a lot of acoustic instruments and vocals. My go-to throughout testing (because it was one of the only albums I could find that was available in lossless on Spotify and hi-res lossless on both Apple and Tidal) was Nina Simone’s Pastel Blues.\n\nThe differences between lossless and high quality are subtle, to be sure. Unless you’re actively listening for it, you might not notice the slightly different texture to the background noise on “Strange Fruit” or the ever-so-slightly sharper sound of the high-hats on “Sinnerman.” And when older recordings clip, the resulting distortion sounds less harsh in lossless.\n\nTo see these relatively minor benefits requires some effort on your part, though. First thing to note is that you cannot stream Spotify Lossless through the web player; you will need to download the desktop or mobile app. The other thing to remember is that Bluetooth generally does not support lossless audio because of its limited bandwidth. Even Spotify warns in its announcement post that “Bluetooth doesn’t provide enough bandwidth to transmit lossless audio, so the signal has to be compressed before being sent.” (Let’s not get distracted by discussion of codecs like LDAC and aptX HD that lack widespread support.)\n\nIf you want to hear the difference, you’ll need to put your AirPods down and go get a decent set of wired headphones. I do recommend headphones. While you can hear the difference on a good set of speakers, it’s easier to pick out the nuances in headphones without minimal background noise. You’ll need to enable lossless on each of your devices individually; it’s not a setting that will sync.\n\nHow to enable lossless audio. Image: Spotify\n\nSpotify has caught some flack, however, for capping its lossless support at 24-bit / 44.1kHz, when Tidal, Apple Music, and Qobuz all offer 24-bit / 192kHz hi-res FLAC support. But, at the risk of upsetting the audiophiles in the audience, you’re not missing out. While I won’t pretend there’s no difference between lossless and hi-res lossless, the improvements are extremely subtle, and not worth the hassle. For one, playing back audio at 192kHz requires additional hardware in the form of an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC), or a select few Tidal Connect-enabled speakers. A DAC can run you anywhere from $50 for a cheap off-brand dongle for your phone to upward of $15,000 for the absolute lunatics out there.\n\nI tested Spotify Lossless, as well as Apple Music and Tidal’s lossless and hi-res lossless, using my MacBook Air connected to a fourth-gen Focusrite Scarlett 18i20. I listened to a variety of styles of music using my PreSonus Eris E5 studio monitors, a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones, and TMA-2 Studio Wireless+ headphones from AIAIAI. I spent a lot of time making sure I could play back 192kHz audio, and volume matching the various services only to walk away wondering if I was imagining the differences.\n\nDoing a side-by-side, I felt like the hi-res lossless “Strange Fruit” on Apple Music was ever-so-slightly clearer than the standard lossless version on Spotify. But I also felt like the standard lossless Apple FLAC was slightly less noisy than the Spotify FLAC. So it’s possible that Apple’s encodings are just higher-quality in general. I’m inclined to believe that because I honestly could not tell the difference between Apple’s regular lossless and hi-res lossless versions when played back to back.\n\nBandwidth also becomes a major issue when playing hi-res lossless files. Unless you’re downloading them for playback offline, just don’t bother. Apple Music frequently choked when trying to skip around a hi-res track and would often pause briefly after playing the first two seconds of a song.\n\nHere’s the thing: Most of us tend to do a lot of our listening on Bluetooth headphones. And those don’t support lossless audio. If you have good wired headphones or a decent pair of speakers, Spotify’s lossless can make a subtle but noticeable improvement to your listening experience. Just don’t be jealous of those other services with “hi-res” audio.",

      "description": "Imagine if George Cukor's The Women was a modern, Spanish-language telenovela set in Ecuador rather than a 1939 dramedy about the lives of wealthy Manhattanites. Now imagine if the series was directed by Pedro Almod&#243;var and its characters were brought to life with stop-motion animation instead of being portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights like Joan Crawford [&#8230;]",
      "content": "is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\n\nImagine if George Cukor’s The Women was a modern, Spanish-language telenovela set in Ecuador rather than a 1939 dramedy about the lives of wealthy Manhattanites. Now imagine if the series was directed by Pedro Almodóvar and its characters were brought to life with stop-motion animation instead of being portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights like Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer. Now, think about how transgressive that show would be if it treated queerness as the norm and told a politically charged story about the relationship between colonialism and capitalism. That show would be a lot like Adult Swim’s Women Wearing Shoulder Pads.\n\nWhen I recently sat down with Women Wearing Shoulder Pads creator Gonzalo Cordova and Cinema Fantasma cofounders Arturo and Roy Ambriz, they told me that they see Women Wearing Shoulder Pads as an opportunity to explore Latin American identity in all of its complexity. For all of its silliness, they wanted the show to feel like a thoughtful depiction of what life in South America can feel like. And to do that, they knew it was important for Women Wearing Shoulder Pads to unfold almost completely in Spanish — a first for Adult Swim.\n\n“There would have been a little bit of a phoniness to telling this story in English,” Cordova explained. “It would have felt like a capitulation to the larger forces of marketability, and my job as an artist is to do everything I can to fight against those forces. It’s the studio’s job to push back against me, and that push-pull dynamic can be what makes things interesting.”\n\nWomen Wearing Shoulder Pads tells the tale of Marioneta Negocios (Pepa Pallarés), a ruthless entrepreneur from Spain who has built a dazzling life for herself in Quito, Ecuador’s capital. Most everyone living in Quito thinks of cuyes (the Ecuadorian Spanish word for guinea pigs) as a traditional delicacy that is part of their culture, but Marioneta sees the furry rodents as pets. Marioneta knows that tanking the cuyes’ marketability as foodstuffs would be a huge blow against her longtime rival, cuy meat magnate Doña Quispe (Laura Torres). And even though Marioneta’s plan would harm the livelihood of her on-again / off-again lover Espada (Kerygma Flores) — a woman who fights cuyes like a bullfighter in massive stadiums — it’s all worth it in the Spaniard’s eyes because she prioritizes her own desires above anyone else’s.\n\nThere’s a pointed absurdity to each of the episodes that makes it feel like a classic Adult Swim series. Characters frequently burst into song, Nina gallavants around Quito riding a giant cuy like a horse, and many of the show’s close-up shots are actually cutaways to living actors. But there is also a cinematic extravagance and cultural specificity to Women Wearing Shoulder Pads that sets it apart from Adult Swim’s previous stop-motion projects.\n\nCordova’s insistence that Women Wearing Shoulder Pads needed to be as authentically Latin American as it is ridiculous was part of what excited the Ambriz brothers. The duo — whose work typically skews more supernatural — knew that animating a more grounded series would present a unique set of challenges. But Cordova’s vision for a story that did not frame being from Latin America as an inherently negative thing spoke to both of them deeply. “We are all so used to seeing Hispanic people represented through the eyes of people who don’t live in Latin America, and oftentimes there are nuances that just aren’t depicted the way they should be,” Roy told me.\n\nAs a lifelong lover of Almodóvar’s films, Cordova always wanted Women Wearing Shoulder Pads to feel like a heightened tribute to the Volver director’s signature storytelling style. Cordova told me that, while Women Wearing Shoulder Pads isn’t trying to be an Almodóvar parody, it is a comedy, which required him to “exaggerate every element of the story just a little bit to see what happens.” That approach to crafting humor is one of main reasons why the series is so keenly focused on the lives of female characters, and why all of their romantic relationships are explicitly queer.\n\n“With Almodóvar’s films, even when they’re filled with straight characters, they are still very queer stories, and it was important to me that we preserve that energy while finding a unique way to express it,” Cordova said. “You kind of forget about the male characters, and we wanted to amplify that feeling. But the second you do that within the context of a romantic melodrama, you really only have one choice left, which is to make every single character gay in some way.”\n\nTo Cordova, the real joke at the center of Women Wearing Shoulder Pads is how technically ambitious the series is. At one point, he’d considered using puppeted marionettes as opposed to stop motion. But he found that working in animation afforded him and the rest of the production team much more creative freedom.\n\n“I’ve made live-action things before where I’d dreamt of putting the camera in the ceiling and shooting the characters walking across the room that way, but this was the first time that I could actually do that kind of stuff,” Cordova said. “And with marionettes, part of the joke would have been their inability to fully express this kind of melodrama, and I think the show would have been worse for having that joke be so obvious.”\n\nThe Ambriz brothers explained to me that creating fluid, dynamic camera movements is one of the trickiest parts of the stop-motion production process. Cordova also envisioned the series putting extra emphasis on dramatic lighting and shadows, which are similarly hard to pull off well in this medium. And many of the series’ more involved sequences required the Cinema Fantasma team to craft far more individualized, handcrafted shots than normal.\n\n”From the beginning, Gonzalo was very clear that this show needed a high-concept approach to its cinematography — not just in terms of the camera’s movements, but also in the way in which he orchestrated the characters’ movements through scenes,“Arturo said. “It’s easy when things are standardized and you only have three sets, four puppets, 10 props, two camera setups, and two lighting setups, but on this show, absolutely every shot was unique.”\n\nThat dedication to craft becomes increasingly apparent as Women Wearing Shoulder Pads builds to its season 1 finale, which puts a period on one chapter of Marioneta’s life. But Cordova is open to the possibility of revisiting this world, albeit from a variety of new perspectives. The world’s only but so big, however, and certain characters could pop up again.\n\n“This show is called Women Wearing Shoulder Pads, and it is my intention for every season to really, really commit to that,” Cordova said. “There will be different women we will meet and different stories that we would tell with returning characters coming back. The intent is that it’s not quite an anthology series, but I would want to build it so every season you can kinda watch on its own and enjoy it as its own thing.”\n\nThe next episode of Women Wearing Shoulder Pads premieres this Sunday on Adult Swim, and the entire season will air as a feature-length special on HBO Max on September 29th.",

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.\n\nIn wake of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk’s public killing, around two dozen Republican lawmakers are pushing for House leadership to create a new select committee that would investigate “The money, influence, and power behind the radical left’s assault on America and the rule of law.” The letter amounts to a request for subpoena power to dig into political opponents in the media and funding ecosystem that the right deems unduly hostile.\n\nIn a letter led by Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), the lawmakers urge House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH), and Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) to “take every step to follow the money and uncover the force behind the NGOs, donors, media, public officials, and all entities driving this coordinated attack.” The lawmakers are requesting a new committee composed of members with prosecution and law enforcement backgrounds, who would have subpoena power to carry out investigations to “get to the truth behind the coordinated global network funding and fueling this attack on Americans.”\n\nThe letter is dated Thursday, prior to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s identification of the suspect behind Kirk’s slaying. Law enforcement officials have yet to declare a motive for the attack as of Friday afternoon. But according to the lawmakers calling for the select committee, “The patterns are undeniable: we are witnessing a sustained breakdown of law and order, fueled not by chance, but by anti-American ideology.”\n\n“We can no longer pretend to be bound together by shared ideals”\n\nThe group says that Kirk was listed on the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)’s “Hate Map” prior to his killing, and claims, “We have seen dangerous networks like Antifa organize, fund, and deploy sophisticated terror campaigns attacking law enforcement and destroying American cities.” It blames “radical organizations” and figures like George Soros for “funding and putting in place District Attorneys and Judges to then coordinate releasing criminals to the streets,” pointing to the recent fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska by a man with a criminal record on a Charlotte light rail car. And it links “coordinated lawlessness and disorder” to the “opening of our borders.” Donald Trump suggested on Fox News on Friday that there could be a racketeering case against Soros, who he accused without presenting evidence of funding “professional agitators” like those who heckled him at a DC restaurant.\n\nThe push follows a wave of statements from Republican officials promising consequences for people who celebrated or made light of Kirk’s death, though many of those statements are likely protected by the First Amendment. “We can no longer pretend to be bound together by shared ideals when a well-funded, vitriolic cadre of our fellow Americans and foreign interests are at war with the very values of faith in God, fidelity to our Constitution, and respect for the principles of liberty and Western Civilization that define us as Americans,” the group wrote, “including, notably, the free speech practiced and exemplified by Charlie Kirk.”",

He had just ordered take-out food, come back from a vacation with his friends on Catalina Island. No indication at all that he was suicidal. No note and no behavior.

Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWhile I generally respect The Wall Street Journal, every once in a while it sees fit to remind me that it is, in fact, owned by Rupert Murdoch. This time, it printed something dangerously close to anti-trans blood libel in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s shooting.\n\nIn its live-update blog yesterday, the Journal wrote, “Ammunition engraved with transgender and antifascist ideology was found inside the rifle authorities believe was used in Kirk’s shooting, according to an internal law enforcement bulletin and a source familiar with the investigation.” That language was echoed in social media posts.\n\nThe right wing, including sitting members of Congress, has been making false claims blaming trans people for gun violence for years\n\nWe know now that the Journal royally fucked this up — the bullets did have messages, but nothing about transgender people was on them. This reporting was demolished slowly and then quickly. First, The New York Times had a source who said the WSJ’s information contradicts other conclusions. Then, CNN reported that investigators just saw some arrows on the casings. The final nail in the coffin came from a press conference held by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who did not confirm that anything about trans people appeared on the casings.\n\nAfter Kirk’s death, the right wing loudly began blaming leftists for the shooting — everyone from Donald Trump to Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna to Elon Musk. Journalists have known for decades now that initial reports on shootings are often wrong. So given the history of false accusations against trans people and leftists, the Journal’s decision to go live with shaky information was staggeringly, shockingly irresponsible.\n\nWhy did the WSJ run with its half-baked report?\n\nSo this is a vulnerable minority group that has been widely demonized. Any good journalistic practice would involve nailing down accuracy to avoid making things worse. That did not happen at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis story was later rewritten without a correction or editor’s note, according to Status, a newsletter about the media industry. Status asked why. Here’s the response from the WSJ:\n\nLike any breaking news situation, we update our reporting—which we published in the form of a live blog—with new information and further reporting as it becomes available. Our initial report about the internal bulletin was appropriately attributed. We built it out later in the day as we got more reporting, and felt that the added material spoke for itself. There was no correction added to that original story because none was deemed necessary.\n\nWell, an editor’s note has been added now. Here it is in full:\n\nEditor’s Note: An earlier version of this article detailed how an internal law enforcement bulletin said that ammunition recovered following the Charlie Kirk shooting was engraved with expressions of “transgender and anti-fascist ideology.” Justice Department officials later urged caution about the bulletin by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, saying it may not accurately reflect the messages on the ammunition, and the article was updated Thursday to reflect that. This editor’s note was appended on Friday, Sept. 12, after Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said the engravings included one that said “Hey fascist!” along with other messages and symbols. He gave no indication that the ammunition included any transgender references.\n\nI still have questions about how this happened. Why did the WSJ run with its half-baked report?\n\nBlaming trans people is, after all, the Republican party line, and who promotes the party line better than News Corp?\n\nShortly after Crowder’s post, the Journal went live with its update. Viewing Crowder as a competitor worth matching is the sort of thing I’d expect out of the New York Post, or indeed most other sensationalist papers owned by Murdoch, who is also responsible for Fox News. (You’d think after The New York Times’ attempt to compete with Chris Rufo backfired spectacularly, leading them to serve as the mouthpiece for a Nazi hacker, serious media would know better.) Blaming trans people is, after all, the Republican party line, and who promotes the party line better than News Corp? But the Journal is supposed to be the crown jewel in the empire, with real, respectable reporting. Its editors and reporters should know better. The Wall Street Journal ran with its wrong report in an environment where the left was being vociferously blamed for the shooting, and where trans people had persistently been smeared for shootings they did not commit.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has not retracted its report about the trans community, nor has it apologized. I guess it really is a Rupert Murdoch paper after all.",

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nDiscord denies that the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk used the messaging platform to discuss his crime, following the service getting mentioned by law enforcement in a press conference — and after accusations that it helped radicalize the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson. In a statement to The Verge, Jud Hoffman, Discord’s vice president of trust and safety, said the company has “found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.”\n\nDuring a press briefing on Friday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said investigators spoke with Robinson’s roommate, and that the roommate “stated that his roommate, referring to Robinson, made a joke on Discord.” Investigators then asked to see the Discord messages and proceeded “to take photos of the screen as each message was shown,” Cox said. Cox added that the photos “consisted of various messages, including content of messages between the phone contact named Tyler with an emoji icon.” Some of the messages captured by authorities contained references to “having left the rifle wrapped in a towel” and “engraving bullets,” according to Cox.\n\nWhile Cox’s statement makes it sound like the roommate reported Robinson had, using Discord, made a joke, Discord’s spokesperson says it actually means the roommate had been chatting on Discord with a third party and discussed Robinson making comments somewhere else.\n\n“The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages,” Hoffman said. “These were communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.”\n\nIt’s a fine distinction, but one that helps Discord downplay any involvement in the killing. The popular platform has been used by multiple mass shooters in past years to discuss violent and hateful rhetoric, and in one case to offer details about the attack itself. That’s earned it scrutiny from figures including New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office probed whether it and streaming service Twitch contributed to violence.\n\nSince Kirk’s shooting, Discord has also become a target of right-wing influencers like Andy Ngo, who claim some “young high-profile shooters” are “radicalized and groomed” on the platform. Conservative influencer Laura Loomer similarly linked the suspect’s alleged use of Discord to the man who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, saying it’s “the same platform the Butler assassin was communicating with people in.” On Friday, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) urged the FBI to look into “radicalization networks,” claiming that online platforms like Discord “are being exploited by extremists for recruitment and radicalization.”\n\nHoffman told The Verge that Discord has since removed Robinson’s account for violating its off-platform behavior policy. “We strongly condemn violence of any kind, including political violence, and we will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement,” Hoffman said.",

      "description": "Rainmaker wants to use flares to seed clouds — the airline pilots' union says it won't be safe.",
      "content": "Rainmaker Technology’s bid to deploy cloud-seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union, which has urged the Federal Aviation Administration to consider denying the startup’s request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines.\n\nThe FAA’s decision will signal how the regulator views weather modification by unmanned aerial systems going forward. Rainmaker’s bet on small drones hangs in the balance.\n\nThe Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) told the FAA that Rainmaker’s petition “fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety” and poses “an extreme safety risk.”\n\nHowever, Rainmaker CEO Augustus Doricko said an email that all of the union’s objections are based on only the public notice, rather than non-public documents submitted to the FAA that outline all of the company’s safety data and risk mitigations.\n\nRainmaker is seeking an exemption from rules that bar small drones from carrying hazardous materials. The startup filed in July, and the FAA has yet to rule. Instead, it issued a follow-up request for information, pressing for specifics on operations and safety.\n\nIn its filing, Rainmaker proposed using two flare types, one “burn-in-place” and the other ejectable, on its Elijah quadcopter, to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation. Elijah has a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet MSL (measured from sea level), which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly. Drones need permission from Air Traffic Control to fly inside this bubble.\n\nRainmaker’s petition says it will operate in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace unless otherwise authorized. ALPA notes the filing doesn’t clearly state where flights would occur or what altitudes would be used. However, Doricko said the documents submitted to the FAA disclosed that in addition to the flights being constrained to a max altitude of 15,000 feet MSL, they will be conducted in airspace that is predetermined to be safe by aviation authorities, “voiding any reasonable concern about high altitude flight or airspace coordination.” ALPA did not reply to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe union also objects to the flares themselves, citing concerns about foreign object debris and fire safety. ALPA points out that the petition does not include trajectory modeling of the ejectable casings or analysis on the environmental impacts of chemical agents.\n\n“Regarding their objection to the use of flares, independent bodies like this administration’s EPA and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding,” Doricko said.\n\nSam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager, said the company respects the pilot’s union and hopes to “continue to strengthen our relationship with the organization,” but claimed the objection “shows a lack of understanding of why Rainmaker has filed for this exemption.”\n\n“Our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations,” Kim added.\n\nDoricko said that a typical Rainmaker operation disperses 50-100 grams of silver iodide, and far less than that in a flight with flares, while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics, sulfur oxides, and soot – significantly more material than a Rainmaker op.\n\n“Rainmaker is interested in doing the best, responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide. ALPA’s objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our CONOP, all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non-public docs that the FAA is reviewing now,” Doricko said.\n\n“Regarding ALPA’s concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace, our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals, intentional coordination with local ATC, certified pilots, and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers,” he said.\n\nHowever, Rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords “with whom Rainmaker has developed close working relationships.”\n\nCloud-seeding already happens today, largely in the western U.S., with crewed airplanes flown in coordination with state agencies. Ski resorts commission the operations to help keep their runs white, and irrigation and water districts fly them to build snowpack in the winter to help feed their reservoirs during the spring melt.\n\nThe general practice of cloud seeding dates back to the 1950s. By spraying small particles into certain clouds, scientists found they could induce precipitation. Typically, cloud-seeding operations use silver iodide for the particles, mostly because they mimic the shape of ice crystals.\n\nWhen a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super-cooled, they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point. Once the ice crystal forms, it can grow quickly if conditions are right, faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances. Plus, the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet, which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation.\n\nRainmaker’s twist — doing this work with drones instead of pilots — could prove safer in the longer term. The company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded, overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews, over rural areas, with other safety checks in place.\n\nWhat happens next hinges on whether the FAA thinks those mitigations are sufficient. However it’s decided, the agency’s response will likely set the tone for novel cloud-seeding approaches.\n\n9/13/2025: The story has been updated to include Rainmaker’s comments from Augustus Doricko, founder and CEO, and Sam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager.",

      "content": "California’s state senate gave final approval early on Saturday morning to a major AI safety bill setting new transparency requirements on large companies.\n\nAs described by its author, state senator Scott Wiener, SB 53 “requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety protocols, creates whistleblower protections for [employees] at AI labs & creates a public cloud to expand compute access (CalCompute).”\n\nThe bill now goes to California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign or veto. He has not commented publicly on SB 53, but last year, he vetoed a more expansive safety bill also authored by Wiener, while signing narrower legislation targeting issues like deepfakes.\n\nAt the time, Newsom acknowledged the importance of “protecting the public from real threats posed by this technology,” but criticized Wiener’s previous bill for applying “stringent standards” to large models regardless of whether they were “deployed in high-risk environments, [involved] critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data.”\n\nWiener said the new bill was influenced by recommendations from a policy panel of AI experts that Newsom convened after his veto.\n\nPolitico also reports that SB 53 was recently amended so that companies developing “frontier” AI models while bringing in less than $500 million in annual revenue will only need to disclose high level safety details, while companies making more than that will need to provide more detailed reports.\n\nThe bill has been opposed by a number of Silicon Valley companies, VC firms, and lobbying groups. In a recent letter to Newsom, OpenAI did not mention SB 53 specifically but argued that to avoid “duplication and inconsistencies,” companies should be considered compliant with statewide safety rules as long as they meet federal or European standards.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The Trump administration and its allies subsequently called for a 10-year ban on state AI regulation.\n\nAnthropic, meanwhile, has come out in favor of SB 53.\n\n“We have long said we would prefer a federal standard,” said Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark in a post. “But in the absence of that this creates a solid blueprint for AI governance that cannot be ignored.”",

At the time, the automaker said it was prioritizing the launch of its gas-extended hybrid Ramcharger truck, which was also delayed.\n\nThe name plate, however, will live on.\n\nThe move followed the resignation of Stellantis’ CEO Carlos Tavares following a sharp decline in the automaker’s sales. The company has been accused of degrading its US brands and failing to release more affordable models.\n\nThe Ramcharger and the Rev were both going to be built on Stellantis’ STLA Frame body-on-frame platform designed to handle electric, gas, hybrid, and hydrogen powertrains. The platform helps stretch the Ramcharger gas-extended EV range up to 690 miles on a full charge and tank.\n\nStellantis became the latest company to delay or cancel its EV plans this year, as the federal government eliminates tax credits and other incentives aimed at driving higher sales.

Sales of EV trucks like the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck have generally been slower than expected. And trucks tend to lose range when towing or hauling heavy loads, which makes them a tough sell for customers who want their electric trucks to do all the truck stuff that’s expected.",

      "description": "From phone spyware and facial recognition to forensic phone hacking technology to databases and more, this tech powers Trump's deportation machine.",
      "content": "President Donald Trump made countering immigration one of his flagship issues during last year’s presidential campaign, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nIn his first eight months in office, that promise turned into around 350,000 deportations, a figure that includes deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (around 200,000), Customs and Border Protection (more than 132,000), and almost 18,000 self-deportations, according to CNN.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass deportation campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented immigrants. To aid its efforts, the ICE has at its disposal several technologies capable of identifying and surveilling individuals and communities.\n\nHere is a recap of some of the technology that ICE has in its digital arsenal.\n\nClearview AI facial recognition\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about ICE and the technology it uses? We would love to learn how this affects you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or Do you have more information about ICE and the technology it uses? We would love to learn how this affects you.

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\n\nParagon phone spyware\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, it’s unclear what’s the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Parago is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company Red Lattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nLexisNexis’ legal and public records databases\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to subscribe to the service.\n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nSurveillance giant Palantir\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with Palantir. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\n404 Media cited “a source familiar with the database,” who said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.",

      "content": "Hike, once one of India’s most valuable startups with unicorn status, has become the latest casualty of New Delhi’s recent real-money gaming ban, with the company — led by Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel founder Sunil Bharti Mittal — now shutting down.\n\nOn Saturday, Hike founder Mittal (pictured above) said that the startup’s U.S. business, which launched nine months ago, was “off to a strong start.” But he said scaling it globally would require “a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.”\n\nInitially launched as an instant messaging app rivaling WhatsApp in 2012, Hike pivoted to real-money gaming in recent years, with its primary platform, Rush, offering casual games like carrom and ludo for cash prizes, following the shutdown of Hike Messenger in 2021. Rush attracted over 10 million users and generated more than $500 million in gross revenue over its four-year run, Mittal said.\n\nStoried investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Tencent backed Hike’s early ambition to take on WhatsApp with a youth-focused messaging app. The startup was valued at $1.4 billion in 2016.\n\n“We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for?” Mittal wrote in a Substack post. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors.”\n\nLast month, the Indian government shocked the $23-billion real-money gaming industry by introducing the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, which imposed a blanket ban on such platforms. The federal government said the decision was aimed at addressing incidents of harm, including cases where individuals reportedly died by suicide after losing money in these games.\n\nIn response, top industry players including Dream Sports and Mobile Premier League (MPL) began shutting down their real-money gaming operations in India. While some started pivoting to new ventures like micro-dramas and financial services, others began exploring international markets to keep parts of their gaming businesses alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Some of them are planning to cut up to 90% of their workforce as they attempt to adapt or exit the space, sources told TechCrunch.\n\nSome VC firms backing these startups have also questioned their founders on whether there had been any early signs of regulatory action — and if so, why no steps were taken to mitigate the impact, sources familiar with the conversations told TechCrunch.\n\nEarlier this week, the Indian Supreme Court transferred all petitions challenging the new law — the rules of which are yet to be notified — from multiple state courts across the country. However, the top court has yet to begin hearing the matter.\n\n“This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger,” Mittal wrote.",

      "content": "The all-electric Ram 1500 REV pickup truck is dead. Long live the extended-range Ram 1500 REV (once called the Ramcharger).\n\nStellantis, the parent company of Ram, said Friday that it will no longer develop a battery-electric full-size pickup. The company cited low demand for full-size battery-electric trucks as the primary reason, according to a statement sent to TechCrunch and posted on its website.\n\n“As demand for full-size battery-electric trucks slows in North America, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will discontinue development of a full-size BEV pickup,” the company’s statement reads. “As part of this, Ram is renaming its REEV-powered pickup to Ram 1500 REV (formerly Ramcharger). This vehicle will set a new benchmark in the half-ton segment, offering exceptional range, towing capability and payload performance.”\n\nIf the name swap is confusing, it’s because it is. But here is what’s worth knowing. Stellantis canceled plans to develop a battery electric pickup and will instead pursue an extended-range truck that gets an estimated 690 miles of range through a novel — but not unheard of — approach of combining a battery with a gas generator.\n\nThe Ram 1500 all-electric pickup was part of parent company Stellantis’ U.S. product offensive to sell more than 25 all-new BEVs by the end of the decade. But its future has been in question for months now.\n\nAfter a splashy reveal at CES 2023, and other showcases in the months that followed, Stellantis wavered on its EV truck plans. Stellantis initially said it would begin producing the vehicle in 2024. That date soon slipped to 2025.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Stellantis delayed plans to develop the broad-shouldered pickup loaded with tech, a longer cabin with third-row jump seats, and two massive and industry-busting battery pack options.

      "description": "The $300B deal is a reminder that despite Oracle’s legacy status, it shouldn’t be overlooked when it comes to AI infrastructure. But key questions around power and how OpenAI will pay for this remain.",
      "content": "This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.\n\nOn the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it.\n\nChirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.\n\n“OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”\n\nSome industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business.\n\n“Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.\n\nPayment and power\n\nBut even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year.\n\nPower is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute.\n\nIndustry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear.\n\nDespite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday.\n\nCompute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now).\n\nBut compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups.\n\nSo far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon.\n\nWith a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change.\n\nThe company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.",

      "description": "Transit tech software startup Via had its IPO debut on Friday, starting at below offering price before rising to close at nearly $50.",
      "content": "Investors took a cautious approach to transit software startup Via’s IPO on Friday, with shares opening below the company’s IPO price before recovering at the end of the day slightly higher.\n\nThe company, which initially filed confidentially for IPO in July, priced its IPO at $46 per share, raising $492.9 million. Those shares slipped to $44 when the stock began trading Friday afternoon, and then inched back into the green to finish at just over $49. The modest gain values Via at roughly $3.9 billion at the close of its first trading day.\n\nVia raised about $328 million in its IPO, while existing shareholders sold another $164 million worth of stock, bringing the total deal size to nearly $493 million.\n\n“We’re extremely pleased with the result of today’s IPO, and we think it is a testament to the value and durability of the company,” Via CEO Daniel Ramot said. “We are grateful for the feedback and support from our team, partners, and investors who made this milestone possible.”\n\nVia initially launched in 2012 by deploying Via-branded shuttles that users could hail. Over time, Via improved its on-demand routing algorithm, which uses real-time data to route microtransit shuttles to where they’re needed most. Now that tech is its core business, which it sells to 689 cities and transit agencies to power their microtransit.\n\nRamot told TechCrunch the company would use the proceeds to invest in growth, sales, and marketing. And maybe even an acquisition, in the future.\n\n“We’re not necessarily looking to raise funds to drive operations,” Ramot said. “There may be an opportunity for us to use the proceeds and the currency of a public stock to make some interesting acquisitions like we did with Remix and Citymapper.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Ramot said he’s open to other complementary acquisitions, rather than acquisitions to gain market share.\n\nVia revenue has increased roughly 30% year-over-year. The company told TechCrunch that it expects to earn around $429 million in revenue in 2025, a projection based on its quarterly revenue times four.\n\nVia closed the first six months of 2025 with $205.7 million in revenue. But the company is still in the red, though that loss is shrinking. The first six months of 2025 ended at a loss of $37.5 million, down from $50.4 million the previous year.\n\nRamot said Via is close to profitability but declined to give specific projections.\n\nThe executive says Via’s growth is proof that government customers can sustain a lucrative business.\n\n“Most tech companies going public are not very focused on this sector, on helping local government,” he said, adding that the technology Via provides mainly benefits riders of microtransit and paratransit systems, the people who rely on buses to get around.\n\n“Low-income people, people with disabilities, students — those are the demographics that we typically support,” he said. “It’s really nice to see investors actually support that.”",

      "title": "Google is a ‘bad actor’ says People CEO, accusing the company of stealing content",
      "description": "People CEO Neil Vogel says Google's AI crawler can't be blocked because it would block the web crawler too. This lets the search giant steal its content for AI.",
      "content": "The CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. has accused Google of being a bad actor for crawling its websites to support the search giant’s AI products.\n\nNeil Vogel, CEO of People, Inc. (formerly Dotdash Meredith), a publisher that operates over 40 brands, including People, Food & Wine, Travel + Leisure, Better Homes & Gardens, Real Simple, Southern Living, Allrecipes, and others, said that Google is not playing fair because it uses the same bot to crawl websites to index them for the Google search engine as it does to support its AI features.\n\n“Google has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,” said Vogel, speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference this week.\n\nHe noted that three years ago, Google Search accounted for about 65% of the company’s traffic and that has since dropped to the “high 20s.” (Vogel shared an even more startling statistic with AdExchanger last month, saying that as of several years ago, Google’s traffic accounted for as much as 90% of People Inc.’s traffic from the open web.)\n\n“I’m not complaining. We’ve grown our audience. We’ve grown our revenue,” Vogel told conference attendees. “We’re doing great. What is not right about this is: You cannot take our content to compete with us.”\n\nVogel believes publishers need more leverage in the AI era, which is why he feels it’s necessary to block AI crawlers — automated programs that scan websites to train AI systems — as that can force them into content deals. His company, for example, has a deal with OpenAI, which Vogel described as a “good actor.”\n\nPeople Inc. has been leveraging web infrastructure company Cloudflare’s latest solution to block AI crawlers that don’t pay, prompting AI players to approach the publisher with potential content deals. While Vogel wouldn’t directly name the companies involved, he said they were “large LLM providers.” No deals have been signed yet, but Vogel said the company is “much further along” than before it adopted the crawler-blocking solution.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nHowever, Vogel pointed out, Google’s crawler can’t be blocked because doing so would also prevent the publisher’s websites from being indexed in Google Search, cutting off that “20%-ish” of traffic that Google still delivers.\n\n“They know this, and they’re not splitting their crawler. So they are an intentional bad actor here,” Vogel declared.\n\nJanice Min, the editor-in-chief and CEO at newsletter provider Ankler Media, agreed, calling Big Tech companies like Google and Meta longtime “content kleptomaniacs.”\n\n“I don’t see the benefit to us in partnering with any AI company right now,” she said, adding that her company blocks AI crawlers.\n\nMeanwhile, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, whose company makes the AI-blocking solution (and who was also on the panel), said he believed that things would still change in the future when it comes to how the AI companies behave. He suspected those changes could be prompted by new regulations.\n\nThe Cloudflare exec also questioned whether fighting the AI companies using legal solutions around things like copyright law, created for the pre-AI era, was the right answer.\n\n“I think that it’s a fool’s errand to go down that path, because, in copyright law, typically, the more derivative something is, the more it’s protected under fair use … What these AI companies are doing is they’re actually creating derivatives,” Prince said. “And so if you look at the best case law that’s come out so far, it’s actually said that the use by Anthropic and others — the reason Anthropic settled recently with all the book publishers for $1.5 billion — was for them to be able to preserve the positive copyright ruling that they got.”\n\nPrince also proclaimed that “everything that’s wrong with the world today is, at some level, Google’s fault,” because the search giant had taught publishers to value traffic over original content creation, triggering publishers like BuzzFeed to write for clicks. Still, he admitted that Google was in a tough spot right now from a competitive standpoint.\n\n“Internally, they’re having massive fights about what they do, and my prediction is that, by this time next year, Google will be paying content creators for crawling their content and taking it and putting it in AI models,” he said.",
