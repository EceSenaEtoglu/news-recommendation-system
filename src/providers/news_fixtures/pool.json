In November 2024, she won her claim against him for damages in a civil case.\n\nMcGregor was ordered to pay £206,000 in damages plus costs to Ms Hand.\n\nProspective presidential candidates have until 24 September to secure the backing needed to make it onto the ballot, with three so far having done so.\n\nCatherine Connolly is an independent who is backed by some left-wing parties - Labour, the Social Democrats, and People Before Profit.\n\nJim Gavin has been selected by Fianna Fáil, which is the largest party in the Irish parliament and led by the Taoiseach Micheál Martin.\n\nHeather Humphreys is the candidate for Fine Gael, a centre-right party which is currently in coalition government with Fianna Fáil.",

      "description": "He adds that \"much more evidence and information\" will become available once charges are filed in the case.",
      "content": "Kirk suspect 'not co-operating' with authorities, governor says\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Hafsa Khalil Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nCharlie Kirk's alleged killer is \"not co-operating\" with authorities and has not confessed to carrying out the shooting, Utah's governor Spencer Cox has said. Suspect Tyler Robinson, 22, was taken into custody some 33 hours after Kirk, a 31-year-old right-wing activist, was shot dead in Orem on Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, told several Sunday morning shows that investigators were still trying to establish a motive but people around Mr Robinson were co-operating. Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University at an open-air event held by Turning Point USA - the organisation he co-founded - when he was hit in the neck by a single bullet.\n\nThe event was part of the American Comeback Tour, which was a speaking engagement that took him to several college campuses throughout the US. Cox previously told the Wall Street Journal that Mr Robinson, a Utah native, was \"deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology\". When questioned on it during CNN's State of the Union programme on Sunday, he said the information was offered by the suspect's friends and family. The governor said among those co-operating with authorities was Mr Robinson's roommate, who is also his partner. The conservative influencer who rallied a youth movement\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson, the shooting suspect?\n\nYoung fans and critics debate Charlie Kirk's political legacy He said the partner was currently \"transitioning from male to female\", but when asked by CNN, said that authorities do not yet know if that is relevant to the investigation. Cox added that the partner did not have any knowledge about the alleged shooting, had been \"incredibly co-operative\" and was working with investigators \"right now\". The governor was also asked about a New York Times report alleging Mr Robinson had spoken to others after the shooting via the Discord messaging platform, including allegations that he joked about being the gunman. His \"doppelganger,\" he wrote, was trying to \"get me in trouble\", according to messages seen by the Times. Cox told ABC News: \"All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him. \"It was, it was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him.\" Mr Robinson was arrested on Thursday night after surrendering to police. An affidavit from the state of Utah confirms that Mr Robinson was arrested on suspicion of the crimes of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice. He is currently being held without bail at Utah County Jail. \"We're interviewing all kinds of people - everyone that knows him - and trying to learn more about what the motive actually was,\" Cox said.\n\nFollowing Kirk's death, Cox has been prominent in calling for unity in a bid to ease political tensions, and has made repeated comments criticising social media. He previously called social media a \"cancer\" and told CNN the US had \"to get phones out of the classrooms\" and better efforts to hold platform owners to account. He called Kirk's shooting a \"direct assault on America\" and said Americans needed to \"look in the mirror and decide, are we going to try to make it better, or are we going to make it worse?\" Kirk's widow, Erika, on Saturday gave a tearful address in which she thanked first responders for their efforts and vowed that her \"husband's voice will remain\". A memorial service will be held on 21 September at the 60,000-seat State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the state where Kirk lived with his wife and two children. Kirk, a controversial figure in US politics, was one of the highest profile right-wing activists in the US and a trusted ally of US President Donald Trump. Turning Point USA aimed to spread conservative ideals at liberal-leaning US colleges, and played a key role in getting people to vote for Trump and other Republican candidates in the election last year. Kirk was a strong supporter of gun rights, vehemently opposed abortion, was critical of transgender and gay rights and promoted false claims about Covid-19. His supporters said he was relatable and understood their concerns. But his views drew fierce liberal criticism, with his detractors calling his comments deeply offensive to some minority groups, including LGBT people and Muslims.",

      "content": "China accuses Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly laws\n\n52 minutes ago Share Save Osmond Chia Business reporter, Singapore Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nChina's market regulator has said US computer chipmaker Nvidia has violated Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The country's market watchdog did not give details of how Nvidia had breached the rules, but said it would continue to investigate the matter. It comes as US and Chinese officials are holding a second day of trade talks in Spain on Monday in the latest attempt to end a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. The negotiations, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, also come as the deadline looms for the Chinese owner of TikTok to find a buyer or face a ban in America.\n\nTop level trade delegations from Beijing and Washington last met in July, when they struck a deal to extend their tariffs truce by another 90 days until 10 November.\n\nDuring this week's talks, officials are also expected to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as soon as October, when they are scheduled to attend a summit in South Korea. The tariffs truce between China and the US cut import taxes that had reached more than 100% on each other's goods. The extension gave them more time for negotiations about \"unfair trade practices\" and to address national security issues, the White House said.\n\nChina launched an investigation into Nvidia in December last year which was seen as the latest retaliation in a battle between the US and China over the semiconductor chip market. The US had been tightening restrictions on sales of certain exports to Chinese companies, including high-end semiconductors. The talks in Madrid are expected to address the issue of what chips, including those made by Nvidia, are allowed to enter China.\n\nReuters China-US trade talks, headed by China's He Lifeng and Scott Bessent of the US, started on Sunday\n\nAfter initially calling for TikTok to be banned during his first term, Trump has reversed his stance on the popular video-sharing app and delayed the ban three times so far. The BBC has contacted Nvidia, the White House and TikTok for comment. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said: \"We may let [TikTok] die. Or we may… I don't know. It depends. Up to China, it doesn't matter too much.\" It came as expectations grow that the deadline, which is due to expire on Wednesday, will be extended for a fourth time.",

      "content": "Brazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffs\n\nThe Brazilian leader said he had written the essay to establish an open and frank dialogue with US President Donald Trump, who has imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.\n\nIn an opinion piece published in the New York Times , Lula dismissed the description by US President Donald Trump of the trial as a \"witch hunt\", saying that it was a \"historic decision which safeguard's our institutions and the democratic rule of law\".\n\nBrazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has defended the trial which saw his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, sentenced to more than 27 years in prison for plotting a coup.\n\nRelations have been tense between the US and Brazil in recent months, in stark contrast to the times when Trump's counterpart in Brazil was Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nBolsonaro often expressed his admiration for Trump, who hosted him at his Mar-a Lago resort in 2020.\n\nLula, a left-wing leader, who is known for his direct tone, did not mince his words in his New York Times editorial.\n\nHe said that over the past 15 years the US had \"accumulated a surplus of $410bn (£302bn) in bilateral trade in goods and services\", adding the decision to impose the tariffs could only be political.\n\n\"The US government is using tariffs and the Magnitsky Act to seek impunity for former President Jair Bolsonaro,\" Lula wrote, referring to the sanctions which the US has imposed on the Supreme Court justice who led the trial against Bolsonaro.\n\nThe trial concluded on Thursday when four out of the five Supreme Court justices on the panel tasked with judging Bolsonaro found him guilty of all five charges he was facing. A simple majority was needed to convict him.\n\nBolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and 3 months in prison - a sentence which his lawyers say they will appeal against.\n\nTrump said he found the verdict \"very surprising\" and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would \"respond accordingly to this witch hunt\".\n\nIn his New York Times article, Lula insisted the trial was \"not a 'witch hunt'\".\n\n\"The judgement was the result of proceedings carried out in accordance with Brazil's 1988 Constitution, enacted after two decades of struggle against a military dictatorship,\" he wrote, reminding readers that Brazil's democracy was restored in 1985 after 20 years of military rule.\n\nLula also dismissed the Trump administration's accusations that Brazil's justice system had targeted and censored US tech firms.\n\nThe Brazilian president said that his country's courts were right to regulate the internet and that US firms were not being treated unfairly.\n\nHe concluded his essay by addressing President Trump directly, telling his US counterpart that Brazil remains open to negotiating \"anything that can bring mutual benefits\", but warned Trump that \"Brazil's democracy and sovereignty are not on the table\".",

      "description": "The court refused to strike down the entire law saying \"the grant of stay is only in the rarest of rare category\".",
      "content": "India court stays key provisions of controversial new law on Muslim properties\n\nThe court was hearing a bunch of petitions that challenged the law\n\nIn Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose.\n\nThe petitioners say the law infringes on the rights of the Muslim community. But the government argues it aims to make the management of Muslim properties, known as waqf, more transparent.\n\nThe court was hearing petitions by Muslim groups and opposition parties against the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025, enacted by parliament in April.\n\nIndia's top court has stayed some provisions of a controversial new law that changes how properties donated by Muslims - and worth billions of dollars - are governed, but refused to strike it down entirely.\n\nThey are important to India's 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages.\n\nHistorically, these properties have been governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level waqf boards to manage them.\n\nBut earlier this year, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government amended the act to add new provisions to it, including changes to how a waqf property is determined and managed, sparking criticism from the community.\n\nOn Monday, a bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih refused to strike down the entire law saying that \"the grant of stay is only in the rarest of rare category\".\n\nIt did, however, halt a controversial provision which allowed the government to decide whether a disputed property is waqf or not.\n\nHistorically, many properties that were donated through oral declarations or community customs have been legitimised as waqf properties because of their continuous use by the Muslim community.\n\nGovernment data shows that of 872,852 waqf properties in India (on paper), at least 13,200 are entangled in legal battles, 58,889 have been encroached upon and more than 436,000 have unclear status.\n\nUnder the new law, waqf boards were required to provide valid documents to claim a property as waqf. In case of disputes, the final decision rested with the government.\n\nThe court held that allowing the government to determine the rights of a citizen is against the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary, mandated under Indian constitution.\n\nAnother contentious provision that was scrapped was a clause that required a waqf donor to be a practicing Muslim for at least five years.\n\nThe waqf properties are currently managed by state-level boards and a central council, with nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of state bar council, Islamic scholars and the managers of these properties.\n\nWhile the judges refused to stay a provision that allows the nomination of non-Muslims to the waqf board, they limited the number of non-Muslim members to four in the 22-member federal board and to three in the 11-member state boards.\n\nThe court also said that \"efforts should be made to appoint the chief executive officer of the board from amongst the Muslim community\".\n\nThe case reached the top court in early April, soon after the law was passed by the parliament amid widespread criticism from Muslim groups and opposition parties.\n\nOn May 22, the top court had reserved its judgment after hearing the case for three continuous days.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

      "content": "Rising seas will threaten 1.5 million Australians by 2050 - report\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Lana Lam Sydney Share Save\n\nEPA Australians are already living with the consequences of climate change\n\nOne and a half million Australians living in coastal areas are at risk from rising sea levels by 2050, a landmark climate report has warned. Australia's first National Climate Risk Assessment predicted more frequent and severe climate hazards like floods, cyclones, heatwaves, droughts and bushfires. \"Australians are already living with the consequences of climate change today,\" Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said, \"but it's clear every degree of warming we prevent now will help future generations avoid the worst impacts in years to come.\" The report looked at three global warming scenarios - above 1.5C, above 2C and above 3C.\n\nAustralia - one of the world's biggest polluters per capita - has already reached warming of above 1.5C, the report said, noting that at 3C, heat-related deaths in Sydney may rise by more than 400% and almost triple in Melbourne. The 72-page report - released days before the government announces its emissions reduction targets for 2035 - found that no Australian community will be immune from climate risks that will be \"cascading, compounding and concurrent\". It warned of more heatwave-related deaths, poorer water quality due to severe flooding and bushfires, and property values to drop by A$611bn ($406bn; £300bn). By 2050, the report found the number of coastal communities located in \"high and very high risk areas\" in Australia will increase and if populations levels remain at current levels, this will mean more than 1.5 million people will be at risk. Areas in northern Australia, along with remote communities and outer suburbs of major cities, were particularly at risk, the report said. \"This will put pressure on health, critical infrastructure, natural species and ecosystems, and primary industries,\" the report warned, as well as posing extra challenges for emergency responders. The report also found that coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia - both already hit by record bleaching events - will face higher risks of \"bleaching and biodiversity loss\" due to warmer oceans.",

      "content": "Cash for speeches and big wins for The Pitt and The Studio - Emmys highlights\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Nardine Saad Los Angeles Share Save\n\nWatch: Key winning moments from the 77th Emmy Awards\n\nThe 77th Primetime Emmys Awards generated another slate of viral moments, from cash awards for short speeches to history-making wins and heartfelt thank yous. This year's big winners of the night were HBO's medical drama The Pitt, Apple TV+'s Hollywood satire The Studio and Netflix's chilling psychological miniseries Adolescence. Tramell Tillman made history as the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series. The Late Show host Stephen Colbert pulled off a big win after his fellow nominees in the talk show category rallied behind him following his show's abrupt cancellation. And awards night host Nate Bargatze implored winners to keep their long-winded speeches snappy with a running gag that saw his charity donation docked if speech-givers went over their allotted time. Here's a look at this year's big moments from the ceremony at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAdolescence sweeps its category\n\nGetty Images\n\nStephen Graham and Jack Thorne's drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder dominated the miniseries category with wins for best series and for stars Owen Cooper and supporting actress Erin Doherty. Cooper, 15, made Emmys history as the youngest supporting actor to win his category, and delivered a heart-warming acceptance speech after giving presenter Sydney Sweeney a shy hug. \"It means so much to me, my family, people back home. So, you know, it's just, yeah, it just means a lot to me,\" Cooper said backstage after his win. Backstage, director Philip Barantini told reporters that they made the show in Yorkshire with the hope it would \"spark a bit of a conversation in the UK\" where knife crime has become a big issue, but added he could not have predicted its global success.\n\nThe Studio wins big\n\nGetty Images The Studio actors Dewayne Perkins, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders, Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Bryan Cranston\n\nThe Hollywood satire Seth Rogen co-created and stars in picked up several awards, completing an impressive run in its first season. Rogen, who arrived backstage unable to carry all the trophies he had acquired, joked: it's \"getting embarrassing\". Alas, he did not thank his fictional right-hand man Sal Saperstein in his acceptance speech.\n\nThe Pitt bests Severance\n\nGetty Images Katherine LaNasa and Noah Wyle at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards\n\nIt came down to Severance's battle of the mind and The Pitt's battle of the heart in the best drama series category, with HBO's medical drama besting the top nominee. The Pitt took home two major Emmy awards in a row, winning outstanding drama series and Noah Wyle winning best lead actor in a drama series, who called his win \"a dream\". \"I want to dedicate this, on behalf of everyone, to all the healthcare workers, front-line first responders. Respect them, protect them, trust them,\" show creator R Scott Gemmill said while accepting the award for best drama. Before that, Katherine LaNasa also won the award for best supporting drama actress for her portrayal of a charge nurse, Dana, in the show.\n\nHost Nate Bargatze keeps speeches in check with a cheque\n\nGetty Images Emmys host Nate Bargatze kept a running tally of donations to the Boys and Girls Club of North America throughout the show\n\nFirst-time host Nate Bargatze, known for his family-friendly humour, knocked it out of the park with his idea to keep winner speeches short: He started off the night with a $100,000 (£73,630) pledge to the Boys and Girls Club of North America that would be docked $1,000 for every second someone went over. \"It's hard. It's tough. It's brutal. I can't change it. This is a game I made up and these are the rules,\" he said in his opening monologue after explaining the idea. The \"game\" ran throughout the telecast, with most winners ignoring it or promising to make up for how much money they lost the club. The check-ins throughout the night made for a consistent running gag. The Studio star Seth Rogen kicked off the speeches and kept it speedy due to his shock at the win, adding another $6,000 to the roster. But his successor, The Pitt star Katherine LaNasa greatly overran, and had what Bargatze called \"a very expensive wave\" that lost the club several thousands of dollars. During a mid-show check-in the total was down to -$26,000 and Bargatze quipped that he's \"actually making money\". But with Hollywood's love of a happy ending, Bargatze closed the show by pledging $250,000 and that network CBS would add on another $100,000.\n\nSeverance's Trammell Tillman makes Emmys history\n\nGetty Images\n\nSeverance star Tramell Tillman, who plays the enigmatic Seth Milchick in Apple TV+'s mind-bending drama, became the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series in the award show's 77-year history. During his speech, Tillman dedicated the award to his mother, whom he described as his first acting coach. Speaking to reporters after the show, he also thanked the black actors nominated in the category before him, including Andre Braugher, Ossie Davis and Michael K Williams. He said his character is a man that is aware of his race and place \"in the world of Lumon\" and was proud that he was able to \"elevate his story\" and \"practice authenticity\" on the show.\n\nDespite show being axed, a gracious Colbert thanks CBS\n\nGetty Images\n\nColbert, whose late-night chat show The Late Show was cancelled by CBS earlier this year, offered up his vintage headshot and made a public plea for work when he took the stage as a presenter early in the telecast. He also received a standing ovation and rapturous chants of \"Stephen, Stephen!\" \"I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege of being part of the late night tradition, which I hope continues long after we're no longer doing this show,\" he said when he won the prize for outstanding talk series. Backstage, Colbert said he didn't yet have plans for his next big move, just that he was eager to get back to work on Tuesday.\n\nHannah Einbinder speaks up about Gaza war\n\nGetty Images Hannah Einbinder of Hacks",

When we attack people we have to be careful.\"\n\nDeparting for Israel on Saturday, the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said Trump \"didn't like the way [the Qatar attack] went down\".\n\nAfter holding talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem the next day, Rubio said Hamas \"needs to cease to exist as an armed element that can threaten the peace and security\" in the Middle East.\n\nThe Israeli strike on Qatar's capital was last week condemned by the UN Security Council.\n\n\"Council members underscored the importance of de-escalation and expressed their solidarity with Qatar,\" the 15-member council said in a statement.\n\nIsrael defended its action, with President Isaac Herzog saying that the strike was necessary to \"remove some of the people if they are not willing to get a deal\" to end the war.\n\nHamas said its negotiating team survived the Israeli strike on 9 September - but five of its members were killed, including the son of the group's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. A Qatari security officer was also killed.\n\nQatar has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel.\n\nIt has hosted the Hamas political bureau since 2012 and is a close US ally, hosting a large American airbase in the desert near Doha.",

      "content": "Madeleine McCann suspect refuses Met Police interview\n\n13 hours ago Share Save Thomas Mackintosh Share Save\n\nReuters Christian Brückner has not been charged over Madeleine's disappearance\n\nThe prime suspect in the high-profile case of Madeleine McCann's disappearance has declined to be interviewed by the Metropolitan Police, the force has said. The Met said an international letter of request was sent to Christian Brückner, ahead of his imminent release for a separate offence, which he later rejected. German national Brückner, 48, has never been charged with any crime in relation to the McCann case and denies any involvement. Madeleine vanished in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007. She and her siblings had been left sleeping in a holiday apartment while her parents, Kate and Gerry, went for dinner at a nearby restaurant.\n\nThey had checked in on the children periodically until Kate discovered Madeleine was missing at around 22:00. Brückner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman at her home in Praia da Luz in 2005. German authorities have said he will be released by Wednesday. Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell said Brückner remains a suspect in the Met Police's own investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. He has been the prime suspect in the German and Portuguese investigations since 2020 and 2022, respectively. \"We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an International Letter of Request which has been submitted,\" Det Ch Insp Cranwell said. \"It was subsequently refused by the suspect. In the absence of an interview, we will nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry. \"We can provide no further information while the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nHandout Madeleine McCann disappeared in 2007, then aged three\n\nMadeleine's disappearance has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world. German prosecutors have pointed to evidence - including mobile phone data - indicating Brückner may have been in the area when she vanished, and have consistently insisted that they think he is responsible. However, they have not found strong enough evidence to bring charges. Brückner, who spent many years in the Algarve, was a drifter, a petty criminal and a convicted sex offender. He has several previous convictions, including for sexually abusing children in 1994 and 2016. Portuguese and German police conducted a fresh search between where the McCanns had been staying and addresses linked to Brückner in June this year, but this yielded no breakthroughs.\n\nPA Media Investigators have been searching scrubland and abandoned buildings in the latest searches for Madeleine McCann",

      "description": "At a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu said every country had the right \"to defend itself beyond its borders\".",
      "content": "Netanyahu does not rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders\n\nWhen pressed on whether the US had any involvement in the strike, Netanyahu told journalists: \"We did it on our own. Period.\"\n\nIsrael's decision to target senior Hamas leaders in Qatar - a close US ally - drew international outrage and criticism from US President Donald Trump. Hamas said six people were killed but that its leaders survived.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said every country had the right \"to defend itself beyond its borders\".\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out further strikes on Hamas leaders following last week's attack in Qatar, saying they would not have immunity \"wherever they are\".\n\nQatar hosts a major US airbase and has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel.\n\nIn response to a question from the BBC about whether Israel's strike had damaged US relations in the region, Rubio said Washington maintained \"strong relationships with our Gulf allies\".\n\nThe meeting between Rubio and Netanyahu comes as Arab leaders hold a summit in a show of support for Qatar. Its prime minister urged the international community to stop applying \"double standards\" and to punish Israel.\n\nCCTV captures moment of Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Doha\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu told reporters that the US-Israel relationship was as \"durable as the stones in the Western Wall\" while he and Rubio made a short visit to the holy site in Jerusalem's Old City.\n\nDuring the trip - on which they were accompanied by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee - Rubio wrote a note and placed it into the wall, a traditional ritual performed by visitors. The men ignored reporters' questions focusing on Israel's strikes in Qatar.\n\nAlso thought to have been discussed by Netanyahu and Rubio are Israeli military plans to seize Gaza City and Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nOver the weekend, the Israeli military pressed ahead with the demolition of residential buildings in Gaza City, and - according to local media - is now poised to begin ground operations in the Western neighbourhoods of the city.\n\nIt has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave and head south to a central area of the strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimate about 250,000 Palestinians have fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area.\n\nSome say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern Gaza is not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some have said they attempted to go south but were unable to pitch their tents, so returned to Gaza City.\n\nNetanyahu and Rubio's meeting comes ahead of a UN General Assembly session next week, at which some leading US allies - including the UK, France, Canada, Australia and Belgium - are expected to recognise the State of Palestine.\n\nThis expected recognition has intensified debate within Israel around the future of the West Bank, with more hardline elements of the government insisting annexation is the only way to prevent a Palestinian state.\n\nIn late August, the Israeli government gave final approval for the E1 settlement project east of Jerusalem, which would, in effect, split the West Bank in two - dividing the Palestinian populations in the north and south.\n\nSigning an agreement to press ahead with E1 last Thursday, Netanyahu said: \"We are going to fulfil our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich unveiled his proposal for the annexation of approximately four-fifths of the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.\n\nThe settlements are illegal under international law.\n\nOn Monday evening, Rubio is set to visit the City of David archaeological park, which was established by a settler organisation in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan, in occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nHe will attend the inauguration of the \"Pilgrimage Road\", a tunnel excavated underneath Palestinian homes that is said to mark the route of a Roman-era street taken by pilgrims to the Biblical temple that once stood on the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary).\n\nCritics say the City of David park is an attempt to politicise archaeology, at the expense of Palestinian residents.",

It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.",

      "content": "Politicians in at least 51 countries used homophobic or transphobic rhetoric during elections last year, from depicting LGBTQ+ identity as a foreign threat to condemning “gender ideology”, according to a new study of 60 countries and the EU.\n\nHowever, there were also gains for LGBTQ+ representation in some countries. Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time in Botswana, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil.\n\nAs the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems.\n\nThere is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nHe said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … or Hungary or the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.”\n\nLGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as the first transgender member of the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according to data from advert tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nIn the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”.\n\nDuring election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+.\n\nBefore the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right parties made big gains, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally.\n\nIn Indonesia, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote.\n\nThe Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”",

      "content": "Romania becomes second Nato country to report Russian drone in its airspace\n\nF-16 aircraft detected a Russian drone in Romanian airspace, while monitoring the country's border with Ukraine\n\nOn Wednesday, Poland said it had shot down at least three Russian drones which had entered its airspace.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the incursion could not be a mistake - it was \"an obvious expansion of the war by Russia\". Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims.\n\nRomanian fighter jets were in the air monitoring a Russian attack in Ukraine on Saturday and were able to track the drone near Ukraine's southern border, the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nRomania says a Russian drone has breached its airspace - the second Nato country to report such an incursion.\n\nIn its statement, Romania's defence ministry said it detected the Russian drone when two F-16 jets were monitoring the country's border with Ukraine, after \"Russian air attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure on the Danube\".\n\nRomania has also summoned the Russian ambassador to Bucharest's foreign ministry.\n\nThe drone was identified as a Geran, the Russian name for an Iranian-designed Shahed 136, which is used by Russia both for attacks on Ukraine and surveillance. It was detected 20km (12.4 miles) south-west of the village of Chilia Veche, before disappearing from the radar.\n\nBut it did not fly over populated areas or pose imminent danger, the ministry said.\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called the incident \"yet another unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty\".\n\nUnder a new Romanian law passed this summer, the pilots were authorised to shoot the Russian drone down, but decided not to.\n\nThe defence ministry said it \"assessed the collateral risks and decided not to open fire\". The statement came after the air force was criticised in Romanian media for not shooting the drone down.\n\nSeparately over the weekend, Russia's railway network was damaged in attacks on two western regions that left at least three people dead. According to AFP, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence claimed responsibility.\n\nUkraine's military said it had carried out a drone strike on one of Russia's largest oil refineries, located south east of St Petersburg and 800km (497 miles) from the Ukrainian border, causing a large fire.\n\nThe Russian governor of the region said air defences had destroyed three Ukrainian drones and the fire was caused by falling debris.\n\nPoland also responded to concerns over Russian drones on Saturday.\n\n\"Preventative operations of aviation - Polish and allied - have begun in our airspace,\" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a post on X.\n\n\"Ground-based air defence systems have reached the highest state of readiness.\"\n\nEarlier this week Russia's defence ministry said there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.\n\nBelarus, a close Russian ally, said the drones which entered Polish airspace on Wednesday were an accident, after their navigation systems were jammed.\n\nOn Sunday, the Czech Republic announced it had sent a special operations helicopter unit to Poland.\n\nThe unit consists of three Mi-171S helicopters, each one capable of transporting up to 24 personnel and featuring full combat equipment.\n\nThe move is in response to Russian's incursion into Nato's eastern flank, the Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova said.\n\nIn response to the latest drone incursion, President Zelensky said the Russian military \"knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air\".\n\nHe has consistently asked Western countries to tighten sanctions on Moscow.\n\nUS President Donald Trump also weighed in on airspace breach earlier this week, saying he was \"ready\" to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if Nato countries met certain conditions, such as stopping buying Russian oil.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress in the battlefield.\n\nTrump has been leading efforts to end the war, but Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin returned from a summit with Trump in Alaska last month.",

It did not give details.\n\nThe self taught multi-instrumentalist rose from child poverty to international fame - with Miles Davis calling him the most \"important musician on the planet\".\n\nHermeto Pascoal, the innovative Brazilian composer famed for his blend of jazz and traditional music, has died at the age of 89.\n\nThe artist was primarily a pianist and flutist, but also played saxophone, guitars, drums, and accordions - and frequently incorporated household objects into his work.\n\nWhile recording his debut album Slaves Mass for Warner Brothers in 1976, he brought a pair of live pigs into the studio.\n\nBorn on 22 June 1936 in a rural settlement north-east of Alagoas, he was unable to work outside with his family because of his albinism, and taught himself music while spending his days indoors.\n\nAged 10, he began playing at dances and weddings, before going on to play forró and other traditional Brazilian music across the region.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he moved to Rio de Janeiro and discovered the city's jazz scene, performing in nightclubs and joining a radio orchestra.\n\nHis blend of jazz and traditional folk styles sparked the attention of Brazil's biggest stars in the genre.\n\nThe singer Elis Regina performed with Pascoal, as did and percussionist Airto Moreira.\n\nThe latter accompanied him on a tour to the US, where he was introduced to Miles Davis.\n\nBut despite earning the respect of luminaries in the jazz world, Pascoal rejected the label as a jazz musician, and said he owed as much to Brazilian music like chorinho and samba.\n\n\"When they think I am doing one thing I am already doing something else... It's very liquid,\" he told Jazz World in 2022.\n\nPascoal's family announced his death on his Instagram page on Saturday.\n\nIt urged people \"to let a single note ring - from an instrument, your voice, or a kettle - and offer it to the universe\" if they wanted to honour him.",

      "content": "Six people have been shot dead in two days in a crime-plagued area of Cape Town, adding to the death toll in a city already reeling from the scourge of gang-related violence.\n\nAt 11.30pm on Monday, two women, aged 19 and 25, were killed and a 24-year-old woman injured in a shooting in Wallacedene, an informal settlement on Cape Town’s north-eastern edge, South African police said. About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked.\n\nThe suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal.\n\nOn 5 September, a man was shot dead at a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, the third killing in a Cape Town court since April.\n\nCape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according to data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz, a Mexican NGO.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according to city authorities, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950.\n\n“Our communities are fearful,” Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. “We don’t have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.”\n\nWestern Cape police said last week they were carrying out “targeted operations” in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: “The message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.”\n\nThe acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for “intelligence-driven operations” to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime, local media reported.\n\n“There is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,” said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance.\n\nMore than 26,000 people were murdered in South Africa last year, South African police data shows. Almost 3,500 of those were in Cape Town, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz.",

      "content": "Press freedom around the world has suffered its sharpest fall in 50 years as global democracy weakens dramatically, a landmark report has found.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), democracy has declined in 94 countries over the last five years and only a third have made progress.\n\n“Democracy faces a perfect storm of autocratic resurgence and acute uncertainty, due to massive social and economic changes,” Kevin Casas-Zamora, the secretary-general of the thinktank, said.\n\n“To fight back, democracies need to protect key elements of democracy, like elections and the rule of law, but also profoundly reform government so that it delivers fairness, inclusion and shared prosperity.”\n\nThe International IDEA’s survey – the Global State of Democracy Report 2025 – is published annually and considered the most comprehensive of its kind, covering 174 countries and measuring democratic performance from 1975.\n\nThe survey found that the freedom of the press had worsened in a quarter of the countries, marking the broadest deterioration since the beginning of the dataset.\n\nThe three largest declines were seen in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso and Myanmar, all suffering historically high levels of civil conflict, poverty and political instability. The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his government used defamation lawsuits to silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year.\n\nThe report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. In New Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently.\n\n“Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes.\n\nChile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families.\n\nThe thinktank highlighted some positive developments: Africa recorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too.\n\nBut the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote.\n\n“These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said.\n\nIn 2021, International IDEA added the US to its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019.\n\nOne measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues.\n\n“Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.",

      "content": "A congressional staffer from Mexico’s ruling party has resigned after being called out online for comments he made on a major Mexican television news program about Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk’s murder.\n\nThe news network, Milenio, also released a public apology after the United States’ deputy secretary of state – a former ambassador to Mexico – evidently threatened to have Donald Trump’s presidential administration revoke any US visas on which it may count.\n\nThe episode that unfolded at Milenio continued a trend of people losing their jobs over commentary about Kirk – a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate – deemed offensive by American conservatives, though in this instance it was outside the US.\n\nKirk, a close Trump ally, was shot dead Wednesday while speaking at a university in Utah. Following his death, conservative commentators, activists and public officials in the US have engaged in social media campaigns against people accused of disrespecting Kirk’s memory.\n\nA Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended.\n\nOn Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador, warned on X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”.\n\n“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the state department can protect the American people,” said Landau, who was appointed US ambassador to Mexico and served from 2019 to 2021 during Trump’s first presidency.\n\nPeople began responding to Landau’s post with examples of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk’s death. Among those was a clip of Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for the ruling Morena party, speaking on a television news program on Milenio.\n\nRamírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk’s killing.\n\n“I think if Charlie Kirk lived, he may like what I am about to say, because what I am about to say is very ‘anti-woke’,” Ramírez facetiously said. “He was given a spoonful of his own chocolate. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. They gave a spoonful to someone who was financed by the National Rifle Association – a political association that is of the extreme right, pro-Trump, of the most radical wing of the Republicans.”\n\nRamírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”.\n\nAfter a post tagging Milenio and the Morena party made Landau aware of Ramirez’s comments, he responded with an image reading “El Quitavisas”, roughly meaning “the visa remover”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico.\n\n“Really, Milenio? This is the level of ‘discourse’ that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,” Landau wrote.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later that evening, Ramirez officially announced his resignation from the parliamentary group for the Morena party within the Mexican house of representatives.\n\nOthers who had similarly lost their jobs or been disciplined at them over commentary about Kirk’s killing have included journalists, academic workers, teachers, nurses a Secret Service employee, a firefighter and a worker for an NFL team.\n\nPreviously, the Trump administration has targeted people, including students and academic workers, for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments on social media and for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nThe FBI announced on Friday that Kirk’s alleged killer had been arrested after a two-day manhunt.",

      "content": "More children around the world are obese than underweight for the first time, according to a UN report that warns ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets.\n\nThere are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10 – Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases.\n\nCatherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children.\n\n“Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health.”\n\nWhile 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sulakshyan, 10, and his brother Subharna, 7, watch videos at home in Kathmandu. Nepal’s urbanisation has made ultra-processed food more widespread. Photograph: Bishal Bisht/Unicef\n\nObesity has overtaken being underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is a problem even in countries with high numbers of children suffering from wasting or stunting due to a lack of food.\n\nThe report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children, used data from more than 190 countries and sources including Unicef, the World Health Organization and the World Bank.\n\nIt revealed that one in five of those aged between five and 19 are overweight, with a growing proportion of those 291 million individuals falling into the obese category: 42% in 2022, up from 30% in 2000.\n\nObesity was highest in Pacific Island countries, where there has been “a shift from traditional diets to cheap, energy-dense, imported food”, the report found. In Niue, 38% of five to 19-year-olds are obese, and the figure is 37% in the Cook Islands. Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%).\n\nIn the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%.\n\nThe steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”.\n\nChildhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life.\n\nThere is growing international concern about the damaging health impacts of UPFs, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt.\n\nUPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sweets on sale at a roadside stall in Nairobi. In the past 20 years, the percentage of obese adolescent girls in Kenya has more than doubled to 13%. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nNomathemba Chandiwana, chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Cape Town, South Africa, said: “We often only think of malnutrition here as underweight or stunting, but obesity has the same long-term consequences.\n\n“About one in eight children are overweight or have obesity, while one in four are stunted. That double burden is shaping a generation’s health,” she said, adding that children were targeted by “relentless” marketing of fast food, even in schools.\n\n“It’s really tough trying to tackle both undernutrition and obesity at the same time. South Africa is a middle-income country, but still deeply unequal. Many children grow up both hungry and surrounded by cheap, poor-quality food.\n\n“Most of the attention and resources go to undernutrition and stunting in the early years, which of course matters, but obesity isn’t always seen as malnutrition, so it slips under the radar,” she said.\n\nGrowing rates of childhood obesity will have a major impact economically. The World Obesity Federation has previously estimated that by 2035, the global cost of overweight and obesity will surpass $4tn (£2.9tn) annually.\n\nView image in fullscreen Children in Kampala, Uganda, consume snacks and sugary drinks during a school break. Obesity is not always seen as malnutrition. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nThe report highlighted the positive action of Mexico’s ban on the sale and distribution of UPFs in schools.\n\nBut it added that “the unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments”.\n\nUnicef called on governments to act on this by using labelling, marketing restrictions, taxes and subsidies. It suggested banning junk foods and their marketing in schools, and better programmes for vulnerable families to afford nutritious diets.\n\nThere should be “strong safeguards to protect public-policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry”, it said.",

      "content": "Early on 18 March 1976, Francisco Tenório Cerqueira Júnior, a Brazilian pianist who had played alongside some of Latin America’s greatest musicians, disappeared from the streets of Buenos Aires.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, his fate has remained a mystery, sparking desperate searches, raising suspicions of government complicity, and inspiring international documentaries. Now the mystery has been solved, with forensic scientists formally identifying Tenório Júnior’s body – and confirming he was a victim of Argentina’s bloody dictatorship.\n\n“He left his hotel in the centre of the city and the earth ate him,” said Carlos “Maco” Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF). “Nothing more was ever known – until now.”\n\nTenório Júnior, known to most as Tenorinho, was regarded as one of the leading figures of the bossa nova movement – Brazil’s celebrated fusion of samba and jazz. One critic praised him as a pianist with “hands of gold” and an “enormous future”.\n\nOn 17 March 1976, during a South American tour, he performed alongside the Brazilian legends Vinícius de Moraes and Toquinho at the Gran Rex in Buenos Aires. Around 3am the following morning, the 34-year-old left his downtown hotel in search of cigarettes and aspirin, and was never seen again.\n\nIn the days that followed, his fellow musicians searched frantically, combing through the hospitals and morgues. Moraes, the lyricist of The Girl from Ipanema, filed a habeas corpus writ and appealed directly to the Brazilian ambassador. By then, Tenorinho, a husband and father of four, was already dead: he had been seized by the Argentinian military and executed, his body dumped in wasteland 30km away.\n\nHis killing came less than a week before a military coup d’état, which plunged the country into a dark chapter of fear, torture and forced disappearances.\n\nOver seven years, tens of thousands of political opponents, student activists, journalists, intellectuals – and countless bystanders – would be abducted, held in clandestine detention centres, tortured and killed. Some were thrown alive from planes, others disposed of in mass graves. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were disappeared.\n\nDecades after Tenorinho’s disappearance, at the 2014 National Truth Commission, his widow, Carmen Magalhães Tenório Cerqueira, demanded answers for what happened to her husband. “Where is Tenorinho?” she pressed. “Tenório was a person who never had any involvement with politics. He was a person who lived for music … And what happened to him is really something that … is absurd,” she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Carlos Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team. Photograph: Harriet Barber\n\nToquinho channelled his pain into a song called Lembranças, or Memories: “Tenório went out alone into the night / He disappeared / No one could explain.”\n\nOver the years, various witnesses came forward; a man working at a newsstand near the hotel said he saw Tenorinho taken away in a green Ford Falcon – the infamous car of choice used by Argentina’s death squads.\n\nOfficial confirmation of what happened would finally come thanks, primarily, to an Argentinian forensic team which to this day excavates and identifies those disappeared by the military regime.\n\nThe group was originally set up by the Texas forensic anthropologist Dr Clyde Snow – renowned for identifying the skeleton of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele – after Argentina’s return to democracy. They made an unusual team at first; unable to find willing colleagues, with many Argentinians still fearful of a return to the dictatorship, Snow had instead recruited a collection of anthropology students.\n\n“None of us were jumping with joy to do this, because if we started to work on this and a new military coup occurred, we would end up on the list of people who could disappear,” said Mercedes “Mimi” Doretti, one of the founders, last year. “But at the same time, we couldn’t say no.”\n\nDecades on, the group continues to search for the victims of the dictatorship, scouring archives, interviewing witnesses, corroborating timelines and conducting digs at suspected mass graves. Today, technological advances also have made it possible to conduct mass fingerprint comparisons – the technique that ultimately led to Tenorinho’s discovery. More than 1,500 bodies have been recovered, and more than 840 people identified.\n\n“At the same time that the state had been torturing, killing and throwing people from planes, they kept their bureaucratic ways of working, recording deaths, taking fingerprints of the corpses,” said Somigliana, who has worked with the EAAF since 1986. “In many cases, the state tried to avoid this, by burning the bodies, cutting hands off, but in others they left a chain of documents.”\n\nWhile the team had been seeking Tenorinho’s fingerprints for some years, his case gained momentum in 2024, when the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity found an old file containing the details of a murder victim who had “appeared in a small unoccupied piece of land” in the Tigre district on 20 March 1976.\n\n“The death certificate said ‘man with many gunshots, around 30 years old, with a beard’,” said Somigliana.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dr Clyde Snow and the EAAF. Photograph: No credit\n\n“We compared the fingerprints with all of those people kidnapped in Argentina, and there was no match. Why? Because he was not from Argentina. Then we asked for the fingerprints from Brazil, and when they came, we were able to confirm that this body was him.”\n\nTenorinho’s unnamed body was buried at the Benavídez municipal cemetery on 22 March 1976, but later excavated and put into a common grave. At present, there are no plans to begin exhumations of the common grave.\n\nWhile the identification does not in itself prove the military killed Tenorinho, the manner of his murder and the way his body was discarded mirror the fate of countless others disappeared by the military.\n\nHis remains were discovered in the same area where other victims of clandestine detention centres had been dumped, cases later proven to be linked directly to the regime. He was also shot more than once, the typical way the military killed victims. While the typical registration of the death – taking the fingerprints and photos of the body – was conducted, his identification was not completed, a further hallmark of state crimes. The EAAF said they had no reason to doubt Tenorinho was a victim of state terrorism in the days before the military coup.\n\nTenorinho, who was born in Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, was one of 11 Brazilians kidnapped in Argentina during the dictatorship. He had no political affiliations, and it has long been surmised that he was picked up for how he looked: he wore glasses and had a long beard, features the dictatorship associated with leftists.\n\nView image in fullscreen Tenorinho on his wedding day. Photograph: c/o Family\n\nHe left behind his wife, Carmen, who was eight months pregnant at the time of his disappearance, and four other children. His parents, who for years sought answers to their son’s whereabouts, died around the 10th anniversary of his murder. His surviving family was informed of the identification this week.\n\nCarmen has passed away, along with two of the children. In a statement, the three remaining children said: “We received the news of the identification of our father’s body with surprise, of course, and with a mixture of relief and sadness. Relief because, finally, we can know with more certainty what happened to him in that sad March of 1976. Somehow, we will be closer – saddened by the confirmation that Tenório was a victim of violence and buried as an unknown, far from family, friends, music colleagues.”\n\nThey said his death deprived them of his company and forced their mother to raise five children alone, one who was born a month after their father’s disappearance. “Tenório never met his youngest son, nor his eight grandchildren,” the children wrote. “We still want and need answers. Who killed Tenório? Why? Why kill a man with no political involvement, who only lived for music?”\n\nTenorinho’s identification comes against an emerging climate of denialism in Argentina.\n\nIn late 2023, Argentina elected Javier Milei as its president – a hard-right leader who has been accused by rights organisations of attempting to “rewrite the history” of the dictatorship’s crimes. He has previously declared “there were no 30,000” people disappeared, and called into question the extent of the military’s crimes. His party has also begun dismantling the Human Rights Secretariat, downgrading the body and recently laying off hundreds of workers.\n\nLast year six lawmakers from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party visited a jail to meet prisoners convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, including Alfredo Astiz, the so-called “Angel of Death”. The politicians later claimed they were reviewing the living conditions of the detainees.\n\nThe office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity, nonetheless, is continuing its dictatorship-era work and is reviewing cases involving the discovery of unidentified corpses in public streets in the province of Buenos Aires between 1975 and 1983.\n\n“We have already identified approximately 600 files, 475 of which are under analysis,” said María Ángeles Ramos, one of the country’s lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship-era crimes.\n\nThe EAAF, which operates as a non-profit, is also committed to continuing its work. The team has become world-renowned, finding and identifying remains all over the world including genocide victims in Darfur, and the bodies of the Chilean president Salvador Allende and the guerrilla Che Guevara.",

      "content": "The conspirators used codenames to conceal their identities as they prepared for their mission: to plunge Brazil into chaos by assassinating a celebrity supreme court judge called Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nOn an encrypted messaging group, one plotter used the alias Brazil, another Japan and a third Austria.\n\n“Each of them had the name of a team,” Moraes said this week as he denounced the alleged plot to murder him as part of an attempt to destroy South America’s largest democracy.\n\nThe group of football-loving would-be assassins abandoned their task at the last minute.\n\n“I’m close to the position. Are you going to cancel the game?” the person codenamed Austria asked their associates on their Signal group at just before 9pm on 15 December 2022, as he lurked near Moraes’s home in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.\n\n“Abort,” replied “Germany”, according to a federal police report.\n\nThe cinematic plot, nicknamed Operation Copa 2022 (Operation World Cup 2022) and involving at least six special forces troops, was at the heart of this week’s historic trial of Brazil’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro. He was on Thursday sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stage a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula.\n\n“[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state,” said Moraes as he accused Bolsonaro of being the leader of a sprawling conspiracy, which included plans to assassinate Lula and the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, to stop them taking power on 1 January 2023.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters at a protest this month. Photograph: Luis Nova/AP\n\nMoraes said hitmen had planned to “neutralise” him using “extremely powerful weapons” capable of piercing his bullet-proof car; they also allegedly considered killing Lula during a public event with poison or drugs that would cause organ failure.\n\n“I’m someone who should be really thankful to be alive,” Lula said last year after the alleged poison plot was revealed.\n\nBolsonaro has denied engineering a coup or being involved in an assassination plot, calling such claims “a little story”.\n\nBut Moraes said there was “ample evidence” indicating the far-right politician was aware of Operation World Cup 2022, which the judge said was part of a larger intrigue called Green and Yellow Dagger.\n\nPolice investigators said a copy of the blueprint for a “clandestine operation” with “terrorist hallmarks” was printed out in the presidential palace on 6 December 2022 by an army general called Mário Fernandes. At the time Gen Fernandes, who was arrested last year, was a senior official in Bolsonaro’s administration.\n\n“This [plan] wasn’t printed out in a cave. It wasn’t printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government … at the same moment that president Jair Messias Bolsonaro was there,” Moraes told the court on Tuesday as Bolsonaro’s trial reached its conclusion.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alexandre de Moraes and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who said he was ‘someone who should be really thankful to be alive’. Photograph: Adriano Machado/Reuters\n\n“The planning is so detailed that it even details the chances of success, what the collateral damage might be, what weaponry should be used,” added Moraes.\n\nA copy of the Green and Yellow Dagger plan, obtained by federal police investigators, suggests plotters planned to use an arsenal that included assault rifles, a belt-fed machine gun and even a Swedish anti-tank weapon, used on the battlefield in Ukraine. “These are weapons of war commonly used by combat groups,” the police report says.\n\nAccording to the investigators, the plan to assassinate Moraes was aborted only because a court session was delayed – and, more importantly, the commanders of the army and air force refused to endorse Bolsonaro’s coup plot.\n\nBrazil has had more than a dozen coup attempts since it became a republic in 1889 but none, so far as is known, involved a plan to assassinate those being deposed.\n\nThe historian Lucas Pedretti said that did not necessarily mean such plots had not existed. Rather, the 2022 plot had come to light because, for the first time in history, the coup plotters had been investigated and put on trial.\n\nPedretti said the existence of the assassination plan was “shocking, but not so surprising”. The historian, who studies Brazil’s brutal 1964-85 military dictatorship, said the armed forces still promoted internally the idea that the bloody regime was a “necessary and legitimate response” to a supposed communist threat.\n\nQuick Guide Brazil's dictatorship 1964-1985 Show How did it begin? Brazil’s leftist president, João Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule. The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974. What happened during the dictatorship? Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”. It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay. But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel. It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures. How did it end? Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy. But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte. Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\n“And this is particularly true in the case of the special forces,” he said, referring to the army group to which the men accused of plotting to kill Moraes, Lula and Alckmin belonged.\n\nPolice believe the men involved in the Moraes murder plot were special forces operatives known as the “kids pretos” or “black cap boys” because of the black caps they wore. Pedretti said the group, set up during the cold war, still maintained the same “enemy elimination mindset”.\n\n“In Bolsonaro’s attempted coup, spearheaded by him and his generals, they simply put that logic and the expertise of the ‘kids pretos’ at the service of the coup-mongering political project,” Pedretti said.",

Eight victims were found in Denpasar, the island’s capital, and rescue teams continue to search for several others who remain missing.\n\nMost deaths occurred when victims were swept away by flood water. More than 385mm of rain was recorded within a 24-hour period, leading to the evacuation of hundreds of people. The floods submerged roads and damaged bridges, severely disrupting transport across the island.\n\nFlooding is common in Indonesia during the wet season, which typically runs from September to March. However, scientists say the climate crisis is intensifying the rainy season, bringing heavier rainfall and more frequent flash floods. Overdevelopment and widespread deforestation are believed to be worsening the impact of flooding.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian monsoon is in full force with devastating consequences. Half of the country is experiencing flooding, with the state of Punjab facing its worst floods since 1988. Landslides and flood waters have already killed hundreds of people across the country.\n\nIn neighbouring Pakistan, more than 2 million people have been evacuated from the eastern Punjab province. Since late June, monsoon-related floods have killed more than 900 people nationwide.\n\nThis year’s monsoon season began unusually early after India’s wettest May in 125 years.

      "content": "British authorities may have certain concerns about the cyber-spying threat from vehicles made in China, but it turns out the country’s manufacturers have security worries of their own.\n\nInsurers have told Chinese carmakers they need critical modifications for vehicles on British streets: namely, tougher locking devices to make them harder to steal.\n\nWith an average of 11 reported vehicle thefts an hour in the UK, and car crime comparatively rare under Beijing’s strict authoritarian regime, industry sources said it had been a “swift learning curve”.\n\nAdditions to cars exported to the UK from China have ranged from the simply mechanical, such as lockable wheel nuts and an extra layer of steel around the car door locks, to software to detect and guard against unauthorised entry.\n\nSales of Chinese cars have risen sharply in Britain this year, now accounting for about one in 12 of all new cars sold, including those made by MG and electric car firm BYD. New entrants such as Chery, which started to sell its own-brand petrol SUVs this month, have sold about 20,000 new cars in the UK since launching the Omoda and Jaecoo brands here earlier this year.\n\nNew models for import are assessed for risk on behalf of insurers, with tests including a two-minute “attack test”, whose results led to a range of Chinese prototypes being beefed up against car thieves.\n\nBen Townsend, the head of automotive at Thatcham Research, a vehicle risk intelligence company, said: “We’ve worked closely with Chinese vehicle manufacturers advising on vehicle security enhancements for the UK market.\n\n“In China, vehicle crime is not the same challenge we experience in the UK and Europe, so certain anti-theft features – like immobilisers, door shielding to prevent access to internal locking mechanisms, and software-based intrusion detection – haven’t historically been prioritised.”\n\nHe added: “These features often don’t require major structural interventions, which means they can be applied to completed new models, and we’ve found Chinese brands to be highly responsive and agile in implementing improvements.”\n\nChery executives said modifications had been swiftly delivered in the Chinese production process. Factory and other staff typically work a six-day week, on lower wages that have contributed to Chinese cars underpricing western comparators.\n\nOli Lowe, the UK head of product for Chery UK, said the Chinese manufacturer had dedicated regional research and development centres to get its cars ready for sale here. He said: “Simple but crucial adaptations, such as the addition of locking wheel bolts, ensure that vehicles not only meet local requirements but also deliver enhanced security and customer confidence for our buyers in the UK.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "content": "President Donald Trump has said foreign workers sent to the United States are “welcome” and he doesn’t want to “frighten off” investors, 10 days after hundreds of South Koreans were arrested at a work site in Georgia.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize investment.\n\n“I want them to bring their people of expertise for a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very unique and complex products, as they phase out of our Country, and back into their land,” he wrote.\n\nAbout 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals, were arrested at the construction site of an electric vehicle battery factory, operated by Hyundai-LG, in the south-eastern US state of Georgia on 4 September.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials alleged South Koreans had overstayed their visas or held permits that didn’t allow them to perform manual labor.\n\nThe Georgia raid was the largest single-site operation conducted since Trump launched a sweeping immigration crackdown across the country.\n\nThough the US decided against deportation, images of the workers being chained and handcuffed during the raid caused widespread alarm in South Korea. Seoul repatriated the workers on Friday.\n\nThe South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, called the raid “bewildering” and warned on Thursday that the raid could discourage future investment.\n\nIn his post, Trump described the circumstances for temporarily allowing foreign experts into the US to build “extremely complex products”.\n\n“Chips, Semiconductors, Computers, Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others how to make, or, in many cases, relearn because we used to be great at it, but not anymore,” Trump wrote.\n\n“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime in the not too distant future,” the president added.\n\nKorea’s trade unions have called on Trump to issue an official apology.",

      "content": "China’s economy showed further signs of weakness last month as it comes under strain from Donald’s Trump trade wars and domestic problems, with factory output and consumer spending rising at their slowest pace for about a year.\n\nThe disappointing data adds pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to fend off a sharp slowdown, with a debt crisis denting the country’s once-booming property sector and exports facing stronger headwinds.\n\nEconomists were split over whether policymakers should introduce more near-term fiscal support to hit their annual 5% growth target, with manufacturers awaiting further clarity on a US trade deal and domestic demand curbed by an uncertain job market and property crisis.\n\nIndustrial output grew by 5.2% year-on-year last month, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Monday, the lowest reading since August 2024 and below the 5.7% rise in July. Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, expanded 3.4%, the slowest pace since November 2024, and cooling from a 3.7% rise in the previous month.\n\n“The activity data point to a further loss of momentum,” Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. “While some of this reflects temporary weather-related disruptions, underlying growth is clearly sliding, raising pressure on policymakers to step in with additional support.”\n\nFactory activity was hit by the hottest conditions since 1961 and the longest rainy season for the same period.\n\nAuthorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to offset Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies and weak consumer spending.\n\nSeparate data this month showed factory owners have had some success diverting US-bound shipments to south-east Asia, Africa and Latin America, but the drag from the property crisis continues.\n\n“Lynn Song, chief economist, Greater China at ING, suggested the weak data indicated “further stimulus support could be needed to ensure a strong finish to the year”.\n\nShe said: “While it is too early to gauge the impact of the consumer loan subsidies coming into effect in September, it is likely that more policy support is still needed, given the broader slowdown across the board.” Song said there was a “high possibility” of further interest rate cuts in coming weeks.\n\nHowever, Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ, said that while the data showed momentum in the world’s second-largest economy was weakening, it was not yet bad enough to trigger a new round of stimulus.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "content": "Thousands of Brazilians have taken to the streets to rejoice at Jair Bolsonaro’s conviction for plotting a coup, as progressive politicians celebrated the historic move and rightwing figures linked to Donald Trump responded with anger and threats.\n\nChile’s leftwing president, Gabriel Boric, led regional congratulations of the decision to jail Bolsonaro for 27 years for leading a criminal organisation that sought to seize power after the far-right populist lost the 2022 election.\n\n“My respect to Brazilian democracy which fended off a coup attempt and today judges and convicts those responsible for it. They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”\n\nColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted. Those are the rules of democracy.”\n\nIn Latin America, 11 September is a date deeply associated with authoritarianism and violence: it was on this day in 1973 that Gen Augusto Pinochet launched a US-backed coup in Chile that ushered in 17 years of brutal military rule during which thousands were killed or forcibly disappeared.\n\nBut on Thursday jubilant crowds in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, celebrated how Bolsonaro’s conviction had given new meaning to the notorious date.\n\n“I’m really overflowing with joy. This is such a symbolic day for us,” said Renan Vidal, a bank worker who was also celebrating his 37th birthday as Bolsonaro and seven co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy.\n\n“It’s the best birthday present ever,” said Vidal, who wore a rainbow flag over his shoulders. “I’m part of the LGBT community and our community was one of the worst affected by the Bolsonaro government. So for us it’s a moment to commemorate,” he added as fireworks exploded above the throng.\n\nYucca Nani, 34, said her generation associated 11 September with another terrible event: the 9/11 attacks in the US. “It was the day that changed the history of the modern world,” she said, adding: “Now in Brazil [the date] has a new meaning, which is Bolsonaro’s conviction.”\n\nAlso at the street party was Beatriz Matos, an anthropologist whose husband, the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, was murdered in the Amazon with British journalist Dom Phillips during Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. Many believe Bolsonaro’s violent, pro-gun rhetoric and dismantling of environmental and Indigenous protections helped create the backdrop for the crime.\n\n“I feel relief, happiness and fire in my eyes,” Matos said of Bolsonaro’s demise. “We must celebrate. Justice is being done!”\n\nBeto Marubo, an Indigenous leader who is godfather to Pereira’s son, said: “This is a special day for us Indigenous people and for minorities … We were the ones who most suffered under Bolsonaro and this is a breath of justice.”\n\nThose festivities contrasted with the ire of Bolsonaro backers, in and outside of Brazil.\n\nThe US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, accused Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge who oversaw Bolsonaro’s trial, of “laying waste to the rule of law” and “driving relations between our two great nations to their darkest point in two centuries”.\n\nBolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has spent months lobbying Trump officials over his father’s fate, told Reuters he expected “a firm response with actions from the US government” after Thursday’s ruling.\n\nDescribing Bolsonaro as the victim of a “political execution”, Trump has hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and announced sanctions and visa revocations against supreme court judges and other officials.\n\nAsked on Thursday if he was planning further sanctions, Trump replied: “I thought he was a good president of Brazil and it’s very surprising that [this conviction] could happen.”\n\n“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” he added.\n\nTrump’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, said: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch-hunt.​”\n\nAt the carnival-style party in Brasília, revellers shrugged off those US warnings – as did Brazil’s foreign ministry which said “threats like the one made today by [Rubio] … will not intimidate our democracy”.\n\n“Let them do it,” Vidal said of possible further US pressure. “I think Brazil’s institutions are very solid and we will not cave in to Trump’s sanctions, however powerful his country may be.”\n\nA carnival parade called the Victory of Democracy Procession is planned in Rio on Friday night.",

      "title": "Indonesia’s climate ambitions can’t shine in the dark",
      "description": "The Indonesian government cannot pursue an ambitious climate agenda while neglecting its human rights obligations.",
      "content": "On August 28, just before inequality protests spread like wildfire across Indonesia, the police blocked a peaceful climate march on the streets of Jakarta. Indigenous peoples, farmers, fisherfolk and people in wheelchairs carrying fairly innocuous signs that read, “Save the Earth! Save generations!” were pushed back by the police and prevented from reaching the State Palace, a frequent demonstration site.\n\nEven though climate advocates formally notified authorities of the march, held to urge the passage of a Climate Justice Bill, demonstrators still got a small taste of aggressive police tactics. These police tactics turned deadly later in the week in fiery youth-led protests against lawmaker perks, in which at least 10 people were killed and thousands detained.\n\nThere’s no sugarcoating what many Indonesians feel about the recent violence: anger but also dread and fear. We are a nation of survivors, having faced the brutality of a military dictatorship that lasted three decades and killed an estimated 500,000 to one million civilians. Our collective skins bear the scars of authoritarian rule, which still tingle. But we’ve also never allowed guns and tear gas to silence us – which is why civil society has pushed initial demands to scrap lawmaker perks even further.\n\nNow, people no longer want just piecemeal responses that try to put the lid on boiling rage. They want thorough reforms that would address the sources of pent-up anger: low wages and rising costs of living while oligarchs and big corporations bleed the people dry. This is scarcely a new narrative. But as the fiery protests show, people have to draw the line at some point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe climate movement, too, is drawing the line. We too are tired of being ignored while the planet keeps heating up, our rainforests are being cut down, “green” mining is driving Indigenous peoples from their land, and coal plants keep running despite repeated pledges by our leaders to phase them out.\n\nIndonesia is among the world’s top 10 emitters. It is also home to some of the world’s largest – and last remaining – carbon sinks. Both reducing emissions and protecting natural resources are crucial to keeping the planet cool and protecting the people from even more devastating climate impacts.\n\nBut instead of using these resources wisely for wealth redistribution and sustainable national development, our leaders have repeatedly been accessories to corruption and environmental plunder that benefit cronies and big corporations at the expense of the people and the planet.\n\nNext week, President Prabowo Subianto is expected to appear at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. It is the first time in a decade that an Indonesian leader will attend the forum. It is clear that the president wants to make his mark as a global leader of significance. But his ambitions can’t shine in the dark. To earn credibility and prove that his military past does not define his current leadership, he must first ensure that human rights are respected at home.\n\nPrabowo has made exceptionally strong statements on climate commitments. At the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro last year, he announced plans for the early retirement of all coal-fired power plants within 15 years. Even more dramatically, he said in July that Indonesia could achieve 100 percent renewable energy within the next 10 years.\n\nBut more than statements, we need action embodied in concrete plans and ambitious emissions reduction goals. Indonesia’s latest climate pledge, the Second Nationally Determined Contribution, which the government aims to submit before Prabowo’s UN speech, will be a litmus test – just like how he responds to demands for justice and reform.\n\nMeanwhile, as inequality deepens, the climate crisis rages on. Extreme floods, longer droughts and more intense heatwaves may hit us all, but their impacts are not equal. The poor and the working class are the ones suffering the most as they lose their livelihoods, their homes and, now, even their most basic human rights. And unless we act with urgency and courage, our children will inherit a planet where survival itself becomes a privilege, not a right.\n\nThere can be no climate justice without human rights. Whenever there’s injustice, we must put up a good fight – whether it concerns the climate or social injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

      "description": "A family member says he had turned political recently and hated Kirk. But Robinson&#039;s family is staunchly Republican.",
      "content": "A family member says he had turned political recently and hated Kirk. But Robinson’s family is staunchly Republican.\n\nConservative activist and social media personality Charlie Kirk was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University in the United States on Wednesday.\n\nAfter more than a two-day manhunt, authorities arrested and named 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson as the suspect in Kirk’s shooting.\n\nWhile naming Robinson, authorities said a motive was unknown. Since then, however, politicians and posts on social media platforms have speculated about what might have driven Robinson to allegedly shoot Kirk.\n\nHere is what we know so far about Robinson and potential motives:\n\nWho shot Kirk – and was he a Republican or a Democrat?\n\nOn Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox named Robinson as the person suspected of fatally shooting Kirk.\n\nRobinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St George, Utah.\n\nState records from Utah showed that Robinson is a registered voter in the state, but he is not affiliated with any political party. He did not vote in the two most recent general elections when he was of voting age.\n\nAt the beginning of the hunt for Kirk’s shooter, Utah’s Department of Public Safety released grainy surveillance camera photos of a white man wearing Converse trainers, jeans, a long-sleeved black T-shirt with a US flag and eagle on it, and a black baseball cap with a triangle.\n\nRobinson’s family: What do we know about their politics?\n\nRobinson’s listed address is his parents’ home near St George, about a 3.5-hour drive from Utah Valley University. Robinson’s parents are both registered Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther family members have spoken in news interviews about how the extended family too is Republican. On social media platforms, some of Robinson’s photos show him holding guns.\n\nBut in an affidavit filed by prosecutors against Robinson after his arrest, they said a family member had told them that he had “become more political in recent years”.\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent Robert Bohls described Robinson’s weapon as “a high-powered, bolt-action rifle”.\n\nAccording to the affidavit filed by prosecutors against Robinson on Friday, investigators found a .30-06-calibre, bolt-action Mauser Model 98 rifle wrapped in a dark coloured towel allegedly discarded by Robinson.\n\nWhat drove Robinson to shoot Kirk, according to prosecutors?\n\nWhile prosecutors have not spelled out a motive for Robinson’s alleged act, their affidavit details conversations with the family member who referred to the suspect’s increasingly political turn and to Robinson’s flatmate.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, one of Kirk’s family members told investigators that Robinson had visited for a family dinner before the shooting. While talking to another family member, Robinson had talked about his dislike for Kirk.\n\nThe other family member also echoed Robinson’s dislike, and both individuals said they did not like Kirk’s viewpoints. The family member also said Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.\n\nWhat has Utah’s governor said about Robinson’s possible motivations?\n\nCox, a Republican, told The Wall Street Journal that Robinson was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology“.\n\nCox referenced cryptic messages that prosecutors said were engraved on shell casings recovered with the rifle allegedly used in Kirk’s shooting.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, one fired casing read: “Notices, bulges OWO what’s this?”\n\nThree unfired shell casings also had messages. They read: “hey fascist! CATCH!” with an up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols; a reference to an antifascist Italian folk song, “O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!”; and “If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.”\n\nCox also referenced the sexual identity of Robinson’s flatmate and partner, who the governor said had been cooperating with investigators.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Cox said Robinson’s roommate was transgender, “a male transitioning to female”, who was romantically involved with Robinson.\n\nThe Utah governor said that unlike the suspect’s family and flatmate, Robinson himself was “not cooperating” with the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Robinson’s roommate revealed electronic messages that Robinson sent that could provide more clues about the suspected shooter’s motive.\n\nIn the messages, the sender, named “Tyler”, said he had left a rifle in a bush and had to retrieve it. “Tyler” also wrote that he wrapped the rifle in a towel. The messages also talk about engraving bullets.",

      "title": "Turkiye court adjourns case challenging CHP opposition party’s congress",
      "description": "The postponed hearing could lead to the removal of Ozgur Ozel, the Republican People&#039;s Party&#039;s chairman.",
      "content": "The postponed hearing could lead to the removal of Ozgur Ozel, the Republican People’s Party’s chairman.\n\nA court in Ankara has postponed the hearing of a controversial case that could oust the leader of Turkiye’s main opposition party, amid protests against the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nOn Monday, the hearing about alleged internal irregularities during the Republican People’s Party’s (CHP) 2023 congress was adjourned until October 24.\n\nProsecutors have accused CHP leaders of vote-buying at the internal event in 2023 in which Ozgur Ozel was elected chairman, allegations the CHP says are politically motivated.\n\nThe case is the latest in a long line of challenges faced by the party.\n\nThe Turkish government has rejected accusations of political interference, insisting the judiciary acts independently.\n\nOfficials said the cases against CHP figures stem from corruption charges, which the party denied and argued are designed to weaken the opposition.\n\nTurkish authorities have jailed hundreds of CHP members this year for alleged corruption, including Erdogan’s main political rival, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who was arrested in March.\n\nCritics say the crackdown is an attempt to destabilise Turkiye’s oldest political party, which won a large victory over Erdogan’s AK Party, or Justice and Development Party, in local elections last year.\n\nOn Sunday, Ozel told thousands of protesters in the national capital that the case was part of Erdogan’s wider attempt to undermine democracy.\n\n“This case is political, the allegations are slander,” said Ozel, who claimed CHP was experiencing the “grave consequences” of government oppression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Anyone who poses a democratic threat to the government is now the government’s target,” he suggested.\n\nThe government denies the claim. Erdogan has described the CHP network as corrupt, comparing it with “an octopus whose arms stretch to other parts of Turkiye and abroad”.\n\nReporting from Ankara, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said the CHP congress case had been criticised by legal experts.\n\n“Many legal experts are against the procedure because, according to the Turkish laws, any irregularity related to a political party’s internal dynamics should be taken care of by the higher election board, not by a local board,” Koseoglu noted.\n\nImamoglu, the CHP’s presidential candidate, also accused Erdogan and his allies of anti-democratic actions.\n\n“This isn’t about the CHP, it’s about the existence or absence of democracy in Turkiye,” he said, after appearing in court on Friday in an unrelated case.\n\nThe CHP has had a chequered history with democracy despite founding modern Turkiye. The CHP pursued authoritarian policies in the past that suppressed ethnic and religious minorities and it has been a key factor in how Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) were able to rise to power and hold it.\n\nThere is also an historical distrust of the CHP from many communities who will continue to stand with the AKP regardless.\n\nAfter Imamoglu’s arrest, Turkiye experienced its largest protests in more than a decade.\n\nIn advance of the Ankara court ruling, at least 50,000 people took part in a protest in the capital on Sunday.\n\nOver the weekend, the Turkish authorities arrested 48 more people as part of the inquiry into the CHP.\n\nOn September 2, a court removed the leadership of the party’s Istanbul branch over the allegations of vote-buying at its provincial congress. The decision was seen by analysts as a test run for the congress case that was adjourned on Monday.\n\nFollowing the ruling earlier this month, Turkiye’s stock market plummeted by 5.5 percent, raising fears about its already fragile economy.",

      "content": "Israeli forces have destroyed at least 16 more buildings in Gaza City, displacing thousands, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nIsrael has announced plans to seize the city, currently sheltering approximately one million Palestinians, and forcibly displace them to the south in what rights groups call ethnic cleansing.\n\nHumanitarian organisations warn that an Israeli takeover of Gaza City would devastate a population already experiencing widespread malnutrition.\n\nThe Gaza Ministry of Health reported on Sunday that two more Palestinians died of malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, as well as four fetuses and three premature babies in Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, bringing the total death toll from these causes to at least 422, including 145 children.\n\nAfter blocking all food from entering Gaza for 11 weeks earlier this year, Israel has slightly increased aid deliveries to a trickle since late July to alleviate food shortages, though the United Nations emphasises that significantly more assistance is required.\n\nIsrael has issued threats to civilians to evacuate Gaza City before expanding its ground operations. While tens of thousands have fled, hundreds of thousands remain.\n\nIsraeli forces have been operating in four eastern suburbs for weeks, largely reducing three of them to ruins. They are advancing towards the central and western areas where most displaced people have sought refuge.\n\nMany displaced people are unwilling to leave, citing insufficient space and security in southern areas designated by Israel as humanitarian zones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The bombardment intensified everywhere, and we took down the tents, more than 20 families, we do not know where to go,” said Musbah al-Kafarna, who is among the displaced in Gaza City.\n\nIsrael’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 64,871 people and wounded 164,610 since October 2023. Thousands more are believed to be under the rubble.",

      "description": "Netanyahu reiterates Israel takes &#039;full responsibility&#039; for Qatar attack; Rubio says Hamas must &#039;cease to exist&#039;.",
      "content": "United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have held further talks cementing the countries’ close alliance, as the Arab-Islamic summit of regional leaders gathered in Doha to denounce the unprecedented attack on Qatar last week, for which the Israeli leader took “full responsibility”, as well as next steps in the punishing war on Gaza.\n\nThe two officials had a two-hour meeting at Netanyahu’s West Jerusalem office on Monday, after which they held a joint news conference in which the Israeli leader said the two countries will continue to act together to protect each other. “Rubio’s visit is a clear message that America stands with Israel in the face of terror,” Netanyahu said.\n\nNetanyahu claimed there is “immense hypocrisy” among those who criticised Israel over the strike on Qatar, even though US President Donald Trump was one of them. He again said Israel will hit Hamas “wherever they are”.\n\nRubio leaned heavily into the Israeli narrative on the war, saying, “Hamas needs to cease to exist as an armed element that can threaten peace and security in the region.”\n\nThe top US diplomat said “we are focused on what happens next” when asked about Israel’s strike in Doha.\n\nThe show of unity comes a day after Rubio and Netanyahu visited the Western Wall along with US envoy Mike Huckabee and praised strong bilateral relations.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said: “The main takeaway from the press conference here was that no new information was presented to the public regarding the attack on Gaza, regarding Israeli military expansion and regarding Israel’s attack that has now been widely condemned and criticised internationally in the Qatari capital, Doha.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Netanyahu didn’t exactly say he would rule it out in the future, but he didn’t confirm or deny the results of that attack. Rubio was shying away from condemning it. He said they’re just trying to find a path forward, they don’t want to focus on the past but focus on the future,” she added.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council announced on Monday that it would host an urgent debate on Tuesday regarding Israel’s “recent military aggression” in Qatar.\n\nThe council said it received two official requests for the debate – one from Pakistan on behalf of member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the other from Kuwait on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).\n\nThe meeting will mark the council’s 10th urgent debate since its creation in 2006.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly dismissed the findings and resolutions of the council on Israeli abuses, including one that urged all states last year to cease selling or transferring arms to Israel, given the carnage in Gaza. Israel and the US boycotted the UN council earlier this year.\n\nIsraeli-induced famine in Gaza\n\nIn Gaza on Monday, four fetuses and three premature babies died in Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis due to the Israeli siege and man-made starvation.\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, at least 422 people, including 145 children, have died due to the ongoing hunger crisis. Since the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report last month that officially declared famine in parts of Gaza, at least 144 deaths have been recorded, including 30 children.\n\nIsraeli bombs continue to rain down on Gaza City in the north, including its residential buildings, with dozens more Palestinians killed on Monday as Israel carries on with the systematic destruction of the area.\n\nلحظة قصف الاحتلال بصاروخين لبرج الغفري السكني في مدينة غزة، ما تسبب بتدميره بالكامل. pic.twitter.com/tvkIPmrc9v — شبكة قدس الإخبارية (@qudsn) September 15, 2025\n\n[Translation: The moment the occupation bombed the al-Ghafri residential tower in Gaza City with two missiles, causing its complete destruction.]\n\nIsrael’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Monday he wants to build a luxurious seashore neighbourhood with high-rise buildings for Israeli police officers over the ruins of Gaza.\n\n“We will finish the mission, occupy Gaza, encourage voluntary emigration,” he said, according to Israeli media outlets.\n\nThe families of Israeli captives held in Gaza on Monday requested an urgent meeting with the army chief, Eyal Zamir, after he said Netanyahu has kept the military in the dark about the next steps after seizing Gaza City, and that occupying the area would not lead to the political and military surrender of Hamas.\n\n‘Stop Trade With Settlements’ campaign\n\nAmid Israel’s advancing plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, the United Kingdom-founded Oxfam International was among 80 civil society organisations that launched a new “Stop Trade With Settlements” campaign on Monday, demanding that countries ban all trade with illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, including by major multinational companies like Maersk, Siemens, and Barclays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organisations said in a statement that their campaign targets settlement trade specifically “because of Israel’s ongoing and escalating oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank [including East Jerusalem], fragmentation of its economy, and undermining of the viability of a future Palestinian state“.\n\nDuring his visit to Israel, Rubio is expected to attend the inauguration of a controversial tunnel project for religious tourists that goes underneath the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan to the holy sites.\n\nThe project has stirred fears among Palestinian residents that it could further dilute their presence and possibly put at risk the physical foundations of their homes.\n\nFakhri Abu Diab, 63, a community spokesman in Silwan, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency that Rubio should instead visit homes, such as his, that have been demolished by Israel in what Palestinians see as a targeted campaign to erase them.\n\n“Instead of siding with international law, the US is going the way of extremists and the far right and ignoring our history,” he said.\n\nRubio played down the political implications, calling it “one of the most important archaeological sites in the world”.",

      "content": "Queensland’s human rights commissioner has blasted the state government’s “hostile”, “assimilationist” approach to First Nations people in a speech at Parliament House.\n\nScott McDougall, Queensland’s first-ever human rights commissioner, has consistently criticised both sides of politics over a range of issues, particularly the state’s youth law and order crackdown. His seven-year term in the role comes to an end next month.\n\nIn Monday night’s speech, McDougall took particular aim at the Liberal National party government’s strained relations with the traditional owners.\n\nThe first act of premier David Crisafulli’s new government was to repeal legislation establishing a state truth-telling and healing inquiry. McDougall described the move as “one of the biggest steps backwards” on the road towards reconciliation.\n\n“In Queensland, we are not walking together towards reconciliation – our non-Indigenous leaders are walking us backwards,” he said.\n\nMcDougall also pointed to the LNP’s headline adult crime, adult time laws, which the government admits will have a disproportionate effect on Indigenous children and violate the state’s Human Rights Act.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nHe also criticised decisions to exclude First Nations representatives from the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, abandon the construction of a First Nations Cultural Centre in Queensland and reject the recommended naming of the new QPAC theatre after one of Australia’s greatest poets, Oodgeroo Noonuccal.\n\n“One can only wonder what the International Olympic Committee were thinking when they were told that the Pathway to Treaty was extinguished by the Pathway to the Olympics. What a terrible message to send to the international community – let alone to Queensland’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,” McDougall said.\n\n“One could be left wondering how the approach of this government could be seen as anything other than hostile when considering this and other decisions it has recently made against the interests of First Nations people.”\n\nMcDougall called for government to “radically reset its relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities”, requiring an “almost immediate 180-degree turnaround” on its current policy trajectory.\n\nHe particularly took aim at the premier’s often-repeated statement during the debate over the future of the truth-telling and healing commission that he had spoken with the Palm Island mayor about it.\n\n“Policies, whether official or otherwise, of ignoring the right of First Nations’ participation in decision-making or, for example, seeking to engage only with the mayors of Aboriginal shire councils, are assimilationist and take us back to the 1950s,” he said.\n\nThe state government has been contacted for comment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McDougall’s replacement has yet to be announced.\n\nIn May, the state’s human rights record was criticised by the UN special rapporteur on torture.\n\nIt came after Crisafulli in April criticised the UN for interfering in local politics, saying “this place will govern its laws”.\n\n“This place will determine how we keep Queenslanders safe, and this place will be accountable to Queenslanders, not United Nations boffins,” the premier said.",

      "content": "Nationalist AfD nearly triples share of vote in local polls in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, preliminary results show.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative party has won local elections in the country’s most populous state, while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) nearly tripled its share of the vote from five years ago.\n\nMerz’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) won about 33.3 percent of the vote in his home state of North Rhine-Westphalia, preliminary results showed on Monday.\n\nThe centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) came in second with 22.1 percent, followed by the AfD, which won 14.5 percent.\n\nThe figure marks a 9.4 percentage-point increase in support for the nationalist, anti-immigration party since the last election.\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia Premier Hendrik Wust, of the CDU, hailed the outcome, calling his state the “powerhouse” of the governing party.\n\nBut the strong showing for the AfD, Wust told public broadcaster ARD, “must give us food for thought”.\n\nThe outcome “cannot let us sleep peacefully,” he said, and centrist politicians must ask themselves “what the right answers are when it comes to poverty and migration”.\n\nThe AfD’s coleaders were jubilant.\n\nAlice Weidel called the results a “huge success”, while Tino Chrupalla offered congratulations to the party’s supporters.\n\n“This is a great success for us,” Chrupalla wrote in a post on X. “We are a people’s party and we all bear a great responsibility for Germany.”\n\nThe election on Sunday was the first electoral test for Merz, who took office in May.\n\nThe western state is home to nearly a quarter of Germany’s 83.51 million population and encompasses the industrial Ruhr area as well as key cities such as Cologne and Dusseldorf.\n\nAfD ‘entrenching’ in western Germany\n\nOliviero Angeli, a political scientist at the Dresden University of Technology, said the results marked a “relative success” for the CDU, but also underscored the growing support for the AfD in western Germany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngeli told Al Jazeera the CDU strengthened its position in North Rhine-Westphalia despite strong criticism of Merz, including accusations of policy stagnation at the federal level.\n\nWhat is “striking”, however, is the performance of the AfD, he said.\n\nThe outcome shows the party “is steadily entrenching itself in the West” after the national election in February, in which it emerged as the strongest political force in eastern Germany and the second-biggest party at the national level.\n\n“While the AfD remains five to 10 percentage points below its national average, it is nonetheless consolidating its position in western Germany,” Angeli said.\n\n“Migration continues to be the AfD’s core issue, and the party can still mobilise around it despite the recent decline in asylum applications,” he added.\n\nThe AfD, founded in 2013 by right-wing economists during the European debt crisis, has moved further right in the ensuing years, vehemently opposing the country’s decision to welcome a million refugees from the Middle East and parts of Africa in 2015.\n\nGermany’s domestic security agency in May branded the AfD as a threat to the country’s democracy, describing it as a racist and anti-Muslim organisation that “aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society” and “subject them to unconstitutional discrimination”.\n\nIt said the party has stirred “irrational fears and hostility” towards minorities, as “evident in the numerous xenophobic, anti-minority, anti-Islamic, and anti-Muslim statements continually made by leading party officials”.\n\nThe AfD has condemned the classification as “a blow against democracy”.\n\nThe party’s strong showing in North Rhine-Westphalia prompted concern among politicians in neighbouring states, too.\n\nOlaf Lies, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony, said he was looking at the “AfD’s results with great concern”.\n\n“This should give us pause for thought because this is a path that is emerging, and we democrats must counter it,” he told ARD television.",

      "content": "Iran’s president has urged Muslim nations to sever ties with Israel – although it remains unclear whether the summit’s measures will go that far.\n\nDoha, Qatar – Foreign dignitaries from across the Arab and Muslim world have gathered in Doha, and observers are expecting them to deliver a decisive response to Israel after its attack on Qatar.\n\nThe emergency summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) opens on Monday, a day after foreign ministers from the participating states met behind closed doors in Doha to hammer out a draft resolution proposing concrete measures against Israel.\n\nFury has swept across the region since Israel’s strikes on Tuesday, which killed five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer, missing a Hamas negotiation team that was meeting in Doha to weigh a United States proposal to end Israel’s genocidal two-year war on Gaza.\n\nAt the session on Sunday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani slammed Israel’s attack, noting that he had regional support for taking measures to protect Qatar’s sovereignty.\n\n“We appreciate the solidarity of brotherly Arab and Islamic countries and friendly countries from the international community that condemned this barbaric Israeli attack,” Mohammed said, adding that Qatar intended to take “legitimate legal measures … to preserve the sovereignty of our country”.\n\nPossible avenues of action\n\nPakistani Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar underlined the importance of the summit reaching a “clear roadmap … to deal with this situation”, telling Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid that the world’s Muslims “would be all eyeing this summit, waiting to see what comes out of it”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo days after the Israeli attack on Doha, Pakistani Defence Minister Muhammad Asif warned that firm action was required in response to Israel and no country should think it would remain untouched by the Gaza war.\n\nSpeaking to Bin Javaid, Ishaq Dar echoed the sentiment, criticising the lack of results from United Nations Security Council discussions.\n\nAsked what practical measures could be pursued, he said: “I think they’ve [Arab countries] already talked on these lines. It’s a sort of combined security force type,” adding, “A nuclear-powered Pakistan obviously would stand as a member of the Ummah [community of Muslim believers]. It will discharge its duty.”\n\nFor his part, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian called on Muslim nations to sever ties with Israel.\n\n“Islamic countries can sever ties with this fake regime and maintain unity and cohesion,” Pezeshkian said before departing for Doha, adding that he hoped for a decision on measures against Israel.\n\nSome analysts said the summit, which ends on Monday evening, could yield concrete measures against Israel for the first time.",

      "content": "Evhen Ihnatov remembers the eight months of tragedy and bewilderment he lived through in 2022.\n\nKyiv, Ukraine – Evhen Ihnatov was a young teenager when Russian forces occupied his hometown.\n\nIn the eight months of 2022 when the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson was overtaken, his mother was killed and his brother was forcibly held in Russia.\n\n“We buried her in the countryside. Grandma was beside herself,” Ihnatov told Al Jazeera of the tragedy that befell the family when his mother, Tamara, died. He was aged just 13.\n\nOn October 6, 2022, Tamara, 54, had boarded a minibus that was ultimately blown to pieces on a bridge by a misdirected Ukrainian missile.\n\nHis brother left for a Russian camp on the day she died.\n\nNow 16 and living in Mykolaiv, studying in a college to become a car mechanic and working part time in a pizzeria, Ihnatov has spoken to Al Jazeera about life in occupied Ukraine.\n\nAfter graduation, he said he might sign a contract with the army.\n\nBut that ambition felt impossible when he was living under Russian control, a period he survived with angst, the denial of all things Russian and a sense of dark humour.\n\nKherson is the administrative capital of the eponymous southern region the size of Belgium, which mostly lies on the left bank of the Dnipro River, which bisects Ukraine.\n\nRussians occupied the region and Kherson city, which sits on the Dnipro’s right bank, in early March 2022 and rolled out in November that year.\n\nAccording to Ihnatov, other witnesses and rights groups, Ukrainians were mistreated, assaulted, abducted and tortured from day one. Russia regularly denies intentionally harming civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They beat people, a real lot,” Ihnatov said. “Those who really stood up are no more.”\n\nA former Ukrainian serviceman he knew was assaulted so violently that he spent a week in an intensive care unit, Ihnatov said.\n\nIn the first weeks of occupation, Kherson city was rocked by protest rallies as Ukrainians tried to resist the new rulers. Moscow-appointed authorities soon packed hundreds of people into prisons or basements in large buildings.\n\n“Detained for minor or imaginary transgressions, they were kept for months and used for forced labour or sexual violence,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a historian with Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.\n\nSurvivors have said they were forced to dig trenches, clean streets, trim trees and bushes, and haul garbage.\n\nAt least 17 women and men were raped by Russian soldiers, Andriy Kostin, Ukraine’s prosecutor general at the time, said in May 2023.\n\nRallies stopped because of the crackdown, but most of the locals remained pro-Ukrainian, Ihnatov believes. He said the fewer pro-Russian locals were mostly elderly and nostalgic about their Soviet-era youth, attracted to the idea of Russia because of Moscow’s promises of higher pensions.\n\nBut to him, the Russian soldiers did not look like “liberators”.\n\nHe said many drank heavily and sported prison tattoos. In July 2022, the Wagner mercenary group began recruiting tens of thousands of inmates from Russian prisons with promises of presidential pardons and high pay.\n\n“They look at you like you’re meat, like you’re chicken,” Ihnatov said.\n\nHe said ethnic Russian soldiers or ethnic Ukrainians from the separatist region of Donbas in the east whom he saw several times a day on patrols or just moving around were often hostile towards Ukrainian teenagers. Ethnic Chechens were more relaxed and gave them sweets or food, he said.\n\nFearful of Russian forces, the Ihnatovs – Evhen’s seven siblings and their single, disabled mother who occasionally worked as a seamstress – moved to their grandmother’s house outside Kherson. While still occupied, the village was not as heavily patrolled as the city.\n\nThere was a cow, some ducks and a kitchen garden, but they were cash-strapped and moved back to the city right in time for the new school year that began on September 1, 2022.\n\nBut Russian-appointed authorities were facing an education disaster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany teachers had quit to protest against the Moscow-imposed curriculum, and enrolment fell as some parents preferred to take a risk and keep their children in Ukrainian schools online.\n\nA Russian curriculum was introduced in all of Kherson’s 174 public schools, and by August, Russia-appointed officials and masked soldiers began knocking on doors, threatening parents and offering them monthly subsidies of $35 per child who would go to a Russia-run school.\n\nIhnatov’s eldest sister, Tetiana, enrolled her school-aged siblings.\n\nStudents at Ihnatov’s school were herded into the schoolyard to listen to the Russian anthem. But he and his friends “just turned around and went to have a smoke”, he said.\n\nThe school was not far from his apartment. He remembered seeing about 50 children staring at Russian flags and coats of arms on the school building.\n\nHis class had 22 students. They were surprised by an oversimplified approach of new teachers who treated the students like they knew nothing.\n\n“They explained everything, every little thing,” he said.\n\nCommunication between students changed. Their conversations became cautious, and they did not discuss sensitive issues, worried others would overhear them.\n\n“Everything was happening outside the school,” he said.\n\nThe new curriculum was taught in Russian and emphasised Russia’s “greatness” while Ukrainian was reduced to two “foreign language” lessons a week.\n\n“Everything was about references to Russia,” Ihnatov said.\n\nHowever, to his clique, Russia’s efforts appeared half-hearted.\n\nTeachers were more interested in fake reporting and just gave away A’s, he said.\n\n“They didn’t force us to study, couldn’t make us,” he said.\n\n“I’d crank up the music in my earphones, didn’t care about what they were saying, because anyway I’d get an A. We got good grades for nothing. They wanted to show that everyone studies well,” he said.\n\nOnly his history teacher would confront his group of friends while “the rest were scared,” he said.\n\nTheir rebelliousness could have cost them more than reprimands had Russians stayed in Kherson longer, according to observers.\n\n“What they did only worked because the occupation was short term. Had the occupation gone on, the screws would have gotten tighter,” Victoria Novikova, a senior researcher with The Reckoning Project, a global team of journalists and lawyers documenting, publicising and building cases of Russia’s alleged war crimes in Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAfter school, Ihnatov took odd jobs in grocery shops or the city market and hung out with his friends.\n\nUkraine ‘never existed’\n\nThe new teachers paid special attention to history classes. Instructors from Russia or annexed Crimea were promised as much as $130 a day for teaching in Kherson, the RBK-Ukraine news website reported.\n\nNew textbooks “proved” that Ukraine was an “artificial state” whose statehood “never existed” before the 1991 Soviet collapse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe erasure of Ukrainian identity went hand in hand with the alleged plunder of cultural riches.\n\nRussians robbed the giant Kherson regional library of first editions of Ukrainian classics and other valuable folios and works of art after the building was repeatedly shelled and staffers were denied entry, its director said.\n\n“My eyes don’t want to see it. My heart doesn’t want to accept it,” Nadiya Korotun told Al Jazeera.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of children in occupied areas were reportedly taken to summer camps in Crimea or Russia – and never came back as part of what Kyiv calls a campaign of abduction and brainwashing.\n\nKyiv has accused Moscow of forcibly taking 20,000 Ukrainian children away and placing them in foster families or orphanages.\n\nIn 2023, The Hague-based International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for the “unlawful deportation and transfer of children”.\n\nSome of the abducted kids “broke”, a presidential adviser on children’s rights said.\n\n“They are really maximally broken. Russians do absolutely everything to achieve that,” Daria Herasymchuk told Al Jazeera. “There were cases of Stockholm syndrome when [the abducted children] became Russian patriots.”\n\nIhnatov’s elder brother Vlad, 16 at the time, was among those who went to a camp – and was forcibly kept in Russia for a year until his sister travelled there to get him back.\n\nIn an unfortunate twist of fate, he had left for the camp hours before his mother was killed.\n\nHe was transported to a summer camp on Russia’s Black Sea coast and then transferred to the city of Yevpatoria in annexed Crimea, where he continued school – and was not allowed to return home.\n\nHis sister Tetiana travelled there to spend a week in a “basement” while Russian security officers “checked her”, Ihnatov said.\n\nThey returned to Ukraine via Belarus and Poland and “don’t talk much” about the experience, he said.\n\nA month after his mother’s death, Moscow decided to withdraw its forces from Kherson city and the region’s right-bank area.\n\nUkrainian forces were greeted like long-lost family.\n\n“The liberation was about nothing but joy, freedom and joy,” Ihnatov said.\n\nBut Russians holed up on the left bank and began shelling the city and flying drones to hunt down civilians.\n\n“In a week or two, the cruellest shelling began. And then – fear,” Ihnatov said.\n\nHis sister decided to relocate the family to the Kyiv-controlled city of Mykolaiv, where they live in a rented three-bedroom apartment.",

      "content": "The U.S. and China have a 'framework' deal for social media platform TikTok in place, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday.\n\n\"It's between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon,\" he said from Madrid. Both President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet Friday to discuss the terms.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said in a Truth Social post Monday that a deal was reached \"on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save\" as U.S. and China officials met in Madrid to discuss a broad range of issues, including the social media platform.\n\nRelations have soured between the two countries the countries under the weight of Trump's tariffs and other trade restrictions. The administration was facing a Sept. 17 deadline to either divest TikTok's U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.\n\nLast year, Congress passed a law prohibiting companies such as app store operators Apple and Google from distributing TikTok in the U.S. given its status as a \"foreign adversary-controlled application.\" Companies would face fines for not complying.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also said in July that TikTok would shutter for Americans if China doesn't give the U.S. more autonomy over the popular short-form video app.\n\nTrump has previously raised issues with TikTok, telling CNBC in an interview last year that he believed the platform was a national security threat.\n\nIn January Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 75 more days to make a deal. Further extensions came by way of executive order in April and in June.\n\nTrump told Fox News in June that he had a group of \"very wealthy people\" ready to by the social media platform and could reveal their identities in two weeks. The reveal never came.\n\nHe has previously said he'd be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison or Tesla CEO Elon Musk buying TikTok in the U.S. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has submitted a bid for an acquisition, as has businessman Frank McCourt's Project Liberty internet advocacy group, CNBC reported in January.\n\nThis is breaking news.

They closed Friday slightly lower for 2025 despite a recent rally, with the stock up more than 25% over the last 3 months.\n\nThese kinds of purchases are rare for Musk with him last buying about 200,000 shares worth around $10 million on February 14, 2020, according to Verity data. It's his largest purchase ever by value, according to Verity.\n\nThe company earlier this month said it would ask shareholders to approve a new pay package for Musk that could be worth up to $975 billion based on various ambitious milestones. Before the purchases Friday, Musk owned around 13% of Tesla.\n\nTesla shares this year have been weighed down by slumping sales partly tied to Musk's political activities hurting the brand, along with the end of certain incentives for electric vehicles by the Trump administration.\n\nAnalysts are torn on the stock with the consensus price target on Wall Street calling for about a 20% decline from here, according to Tipranks.com. Though many are optimistic over the long term if Musk can pull off a transformation of the company to focus more on autonomous driving, A.I. and robotics. The CEO wants shareholders to approve an investment by Tesla into his latest company, xAI.\n\nThe insider purchase \"is a huge sign of confidence for Tesla bulls and shows Musk is doubling down on his Tesla A.I. bet,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush.\n\nThe pay package shareholders will vote on in November has an ultimate goalpost of a $8.5 trillion market value.

      "content": "A protester brandishes a smoke flame by a barricade on fire during a demonstration part of the \"Bloquons tout\" (\"Let's block everything\") protest movement, in the south east of Paris, on September 10, 2025. The broad anti-government campaign, dubbed \"Bloquons tout\" (\"Let's block everything\"), calls for a ahutdown of France on September 10 with a string of protest actions and civil disobedience around the country. Alain Jocard | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFrance's borrowing costs ticked higher on Monday as traders reacted to Fitch's decision Friday to downgrade the country's credit rating amid ongoing uncertainty over the country's political leadership. Fitch downgraded France's credit rating from 'AA-' to 'A+' with a stable outlook, citing a \"high and rising debt ratio\" and warning that \"political fragmentation\" was hindering fiscal consolidation. On Monday morning, the yield on France's benchmark 10-year government bond initially moved 7 basis points higher to 3.5132% at 7.40 a.m. London time, whereas the yield on the 30-year bond , or OATs as they're called in France, rose 8 basis points to 4.3351%.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nBoth yields have since retreated in early deals, and were broadly flat around 9:13 a.m. London time, perhaps reflecting the fact that credit rating downgrades were expected in the days after the collapse of former Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government on Monday following a confidence vote. Cognisant of the wary and weary eyes of investors — who have followed more than a year of tumult in French politics amid stark disagreements about the 2026 budget — French President Emmanuel Macron quickly elected a new prime minister, France's fifth in less than two years. Whether his ally, former Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, will fare any better as PM remains to be seen, with analysts predicting he will face the same opposition to spending cuts and tax rises (Bayrou had targeted 44 billion euros, or $51.5 billion, worth of cuts), necessary to reduce France's budget deficit. There was no honeymoon period for Lecornu, with protests erupting on the day he was sworn in as PM, and more union-backed demonstrations due this week, with major disruption expected on Thursday.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor its part, Fitch projected that France's fiscal deficit would stand at 5.5% of gross domestic product in 2025, down from 5.8% of GDP in 2024, but warned this was still high compared with the projected euro zone median deficit of 2.7%. In addition, Fitch forecast that French debt would increase to 121% of GDP in 2027 from 113.2% in 2024, \"without a clear horizon for debt stabilisation in subsequent years.\"\n\nMore downgrades ahead?\n\nWorrying for France, Fitch's latest appraisal of France's credit-worthiness was the first of several rating reviews on the horizon. Moody's is due to announce its latest review of the risks associated with investing in the nation's debt on Oct. 24, and Standard and Poor's (S&P) is expected on Nov. 28.",

      "title": "Why is Sam Altman losing sleep? OpenAI CEO addresses controversies in sweeping interview",
      "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed a plethora of moral and ethical questions regarding his company and its AI chatbot in a sweeping interview with Tucker Carlson.",
      "content": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and Lisa Su, CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, testify during the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing titled \"Winning the AI Race: Strengthening U.S. Capabilities in Computing and Innovation,\" in Hart building on Thursday, May 8, 2025. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\n\nIn a sweeping interview last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed a plethora of moral and ethical questions regarding his company and the popular ChatGPT AI model. \"Look, I don't sleep that well at night. There's a lot of stuff that I feel a lot of weight on, but probably nothing more than the fact that every day, hundreds of millions of people talk to our model,\" Altman told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a nearly hour-long interview. \"I don't actually worry about us getting the big moral decisions wrong,\" Altman said, though he admitted \"maybe we will get those wrong too.\" Rather, he said he loses the most sleep over the \"very small decisions\" on model behavior, which can ultimately have big repercussions. These decisions tend to center around the ethics that inform ChatGPT, and what questions the chatbot does and doesn't answer. Here's an outline of some of those moral and ethical dilemmas that appear to be keeping Altman awake at night.\n\nHow does ChatGPT address suicide?\n\nAccording to Altman, the most difficult issue the company is grappling with recently is how ChatGPT approaches suicide, in light of a lawsuit from a family who blamed the chatbot for their teenage son's suicide. The CEO said that out of the thousands of people who commit suicide each week, many of them could possibly have been talking to ChatGPT in the lead-up. \"They probably talked about [suicide], and we probably didn't save their lives,\" Altman said candidly. \"Maybe we could have said something better. Maybe we could have been more proactive. Maybe we could have provided a little bit better advice about, hey, you need to get this help.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nLast month, the parents of Adam Raine filed a product liability and wrongful death suit against OpenAI after their son died by suicide at age 16. In the lawsuit, the family said that \"ChatGPT actively helped Adam explore suicide methods.\" Soon after, in a blog post titled \"Helping people when they need it most,\" OpenAI detailed plans to address ChatGPT's shortcomings when handling \"sensitive situations,\" and said it would keep improving its technology to protect people who are at their most vulnerable.\n\nHow are ChatGPT's ethics determined?\n\nAnother large topic broached in the sit-down interview was the ethics and morals that inform ChatGPT and its stewards. While Altman described the base model of ChatGPT as trained on the collective experience, knowledge and learnings of humanity, he said that OpenAI must then align certain behaviors of the chatbot and decide what questions it won't answer. \"This is a really hard problem. We have a lot of users now, and they come from very different life perspectives... But on the whole, I have been pleasantly surprised with the model's ability to learn and apply a moral framework.\" When pressed on how certain model specifications are decided, Altman said the company had consulted \"hundreds of moral philosophers and people who thought about ethics of technology and systems.\" An example he gave of a model specification made was that ChatGPT will avoid answering questions on how to make biological weapons if prompted by users. \"There are clear examples of where society has an interest that is in significant tension with user freedom,\" Altman said, though he added the company \"won't get everything right, and also needs the input of the world\" to help make these decisions.\n\nHow private is ChatGPT?\n\nAnother big discussion topic was the concept of user privacy regarding chatbots, with Carlson arguing that generative AI could be used for \"totalitarian control.\" In response, Altman said one piece of policy he has been pushing for in Washington is \"AI privilege,\" which refers to the idea that anything a user says to a chatbot should be completely confidential. \"When you talk to a doctor about your health or a lawyer about your legal problems, the government cannot get that information, right?... I think we should have the same concept for AI.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nAccording to Altman, that would allow users to consult AI chatbots about their medical history and legal problems, among other things. Currently, U.S. officials can subpoena the company for user data, he added. \"I think I feel optimistic that we can get the government to understand the importance of this,\" he said.\n\nWill ChatGPT be used in military operations?\n\nAsked by Carlson if ChatGPT would be used by the military to harm humans, Altman didn't provide a direct answer. \"I don't know the way that people in the military use ChatGPT today... but I suspect there's a lot of people in the military talking to ChatGPT for advice.\" Later, he added that he wasn't sure \"exactly how to feel about that.\" OpenAI was one of the AI companies that received a $200 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to put generative AI to work for the U.S. military. The firm said in a blog post that it would provide the U.S. government access to custom AI models for national security, support and product roadmap information.\n\nJust how powerful is OpenAI?\n\nCarlson, in his interview, predicted that on its current trajectory, generative AI and by extension, Sam Altman, could amass more power than any other person, going so far as to call ChatGPT a \"religion.\" In response, Altman said he used to worry a lot about the concentration of power that could result from generative AI, but he now believes that AI will result in \"a huge up leveling\" of all people.\n\nGet a weekly round up of the top tech stories from around the world in your inbox every Friday.

      "title": "Chinese EV players take fight to legacy European automakers on their home turf",
      "description": "Chinese electric carmakers Xpeng and GAC this week signalled aggressive expansion plans in Europe.",
      "content": "Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng speaks to reporters at the electric carmaker's stand at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nGermany this week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf. The IAA Mobility conference in Munich was packed full of companies with huge stands showing off their latest cars and technology. Among some of the biggest displays were those from Chinese electric car companies, underscoring their ambitions to expand beyond China. Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. At the same time, Tesla , which was for so long seen as the electric vehicle market leader, has seen sales decline in the region. Despite Chinese EV makers facing tariffs from the European Union, players from the world's second-largest economy have responded to the ramping up of competition by setting aggressive sales and expansion targets. \"The current growth of Xpeng globally is faster than we have expected,\" He Xiaopeng, the CEO of Xpeng told CNBC in an interview this week.\n\nAggressive expansion plans\n\nChinese carmakers who spoke to CNBC at the IAA show signaled their ambitious expansion plans. Xpeng's He said in an interview that the company is looking to launch its mass-market Mona series in Europe next year. In China, Xpeng's Mona cars start at the equivalent of just under $17,000. Bringing this to Europe would add some serious price competition.\n\nwatch now\n\nMeanwhile, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) is targeting rapid growth of its sales in Europe. Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC that the company aims to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year and at least 50,000 units by 2027. GAC also announced plans to bring two EVs — the Aion V and Aion UT — to Europe. Leapmotor was also in attendance with their own stand. There are signs that Chinese players have made early in roads into Europe. The market share of Chinese car brands in Europe nearly doubled in the first half of the year versus the same period in 2024, though it still remains low at just over 5%, according to Jato Dynamics. \"The significant presence of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers at the IAA Mobility, signals their growing ambitions and confidence in the European market,\" Murtuza Ali, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nTech and gadgets in focus\n\nMany of the Chinese car firms have positioned themselves as technology companies, much like Tesla, and their cars highlight that. Many of the electric vehicles have big screens equipped with flashy interfaces and voice assistants. And in a bid to lure buyers, some companies have included additional gadgets. For example, GAC's Aion V sported a refrigerator as well as a massage function as part of the seating.\n\nThe Aion V is one of the cars GAC is launching in Europe as it looks to expand its presence in the region. The Aion V is on display at the company's stand at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich, Germany on September 9, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nThis is one way that the Chinese players sought to differentiate themselves from legacy brands. \"The chances of success for Chinese automakers are strong, especially as they have an edge in terms of affordability, battery technology, and production scale,\" Counterpoint's Ali said.\n\nEurope's carmakers push back\n\nLegacy carmakers sought to flex their own muscles at the IAA with Volskwagen , BMW and Mercedes having among the biggest stands at the show. Mercedes in particular had advertising displayed all across the front entrance of the event. BMW, like the Chinese players, had a big focus on technology by talking up its so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system. BMW, which introduced the iX3 at the event, and chipmaker Qualcomm also announced assisted driving software that the two companies co-developed. Volkswagen and French auto firm Renault also showed off some new electric cars. Regardless of the product blitz, there are still concerns that European companies are not moving fast enough. BMW's new iX3 is based on the electric vehicle platform it first debuted two years ago. Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers have been quick in bringing out and launching newer models. \"A commitment to legacy structures and incrementalism has slowed its ability to build and leverage a robust EV ecosystem, leaving it behind fast moving rivals,\" Tammy Madsen, professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said of BMW. While European autos have a strong brand history and their CEOs acknowledged and welcomed the competition this week in interviews with CNBC, the Chinese are not letting up.\n\nwatch now",

      "description": "From where to sit in restaurants to what to wear in India, Lucy Handley shares stories and tips from her solo trips in Asia, Europe and North America.",
      "content": "From mountain trekking in India to a silent retreat in Bali, I've been fortunate to travel solo multiple times in the past decade. Over the years, I've found that mixing tours with independent travel helps me get the most out of my trips. Meeting people is high on my priority list, as is feeling safe when I travel. Here are some tips to do both.\n\nCover your calves in India\n\nIn the southern state of Kerala, India, I stayed at Soul and Surf, a guesthouse in the town of Varkala that specializes in yoga classes and surfing lessons. While on the resort's grounds on a grassy clifftop, I lazed in a bikini among mainly western tourists. But in the center of the small town, I wore long dresses or pants and made sure to cover my legs and shoulders.\n\nI reveled in waking up solo and being able to choose exactly what I wanted to do each day. Lucy Handley\n\nLocal people dress modestly, and it was important for me to respect that: I also felt that I would be less likely to attract unwanted attention. Kerala has a reputation for being more relaxed than other parts of India but I still covered up. Following local customs is a good way to fit in to any destination.\n\nJoin a tour — but do your own thing too\n\nWhen traveling by myself, I aim for a mix of organized tours and solo explorations. On a trip to Vietnam, I joined a sightseeing tour of the Mekong Delta, a network of rivers and islands in the southern tip of the country. While the tour was undeniably touristy, I got the chance to chat with others and hear their stories. We had evenings to ourselves, and I enjoyed swimming alone at the hotel's pool and eating street food for dinner by myself.\n\nThe author on a tour of an island in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Lucy Handley\n\nAfter the tour, I enjoyed doing my own thing on Phu Quoc, an island in the Gulf of Thailand. I reveled in waking up solo and being able to choose exactly what I wanted to do each day. I mixed tours with solo travel on my trip to Kerala too. After a few days by the beach, I joined an organized trek of the Western Ghats from the hill town of Munnar, hiking through tea plantations, cardamom fields and rainforests, where we had to get off the beaten path so as not to disturb the area's wild elephants.\n\nYoga can take you everywhere\n\nI have attended yoga classes alone in Las Vegas, the Spanish island of Mallorca, and the tourist-friendly state of Goa, India. A retreat at Villa De Zoysa, a family-owned estate in southern Sri Lanka, kickstarted my love of yoga, and it has helped me find community when I travel alone. For those who aren't fans, language and dance classes could work too. While cat-sitting in Mallorca, I joined classes at Bini Balance, run by yoga instructor Cristina Moragues. She invited me to join a retreat in the nearby Serra de Tramuntana mountain range that runs through the center of the island. In Goa, I approached tourists who were walking on Patnem Beach, carrying yoga mats. They invited me to join a class, and we became vacation buddies, going on a boat trip to neighboring beaches and spending the evening at a silent disco together.\n\nSit at the bar when eating out\n\nDining alone can feel exposing, so I often look for restaurants where there are seats at the bar. On a solo trip to New Orleans to see Beyonce perform during her 2023 Renaissance tour, I had brunch at Willa Jean in the city's central business district. I sat at the bar, enjoying avocado toast and a paloma cocktail, while chatting to a private jet company operator and an LVMH executive, who were both in town for business.\n\nSitting at the counter or bar at a restaurant can be a good way to meet other travelers when vacationing alone. Westend61 | Getty Images\n\nAt Bearcat, also in the CBD, there's a large menu with breakfast classics alongside Southern crab and lobster specials, and I found sitting at the bar a good way to take in the buzzy atmosphere.\n\nGet off your phone\n\nCall me old school, but I love a proper travel guidebook. I find trawling endless online reviews for hotel or restaurant recommendations tedious and instead rely on \"Lonely Planet\" or \"Rough Guide\" books. It also feels safer — I'm less likely to have my phone in my hand scrolling on an unfamiliar street. Plus, it means I look up more and can take in more of my surroundings. Guided walking tours are also a great way to explore a city without your nose in your phone. I took a walking tour of Ho Chi Minh City with GuruWalk, which runs on a pay-what-you-can basis.\n\nStay in a hotel with group activities\n\nHotels that offer activities can make for an easy solo trip. Red Mountain Resort in Utah offers packages that include group guided hikes, classes such as Pilates, core fitness and meditation. While there, I found these activities made it easy to meet other travelers.\n\nGuests can go on a kayak or paddleboard \"safari\" to an adjacent bay at Neilson's Beach Club in Sardinia. Source: Neilson\n\nMeanwhile, British holiday company Neilson includes activities like cycling, tennis classes, paddle boarding and sailing in its vacations, and its social dining table can be a friendly place for solo travelers. Traveling during school terms increases your chances of meeting others who are vacationing alone — and it's cheaper, too. Certain activities attract solo travelers too. In Indonesia, I stayed at Bali Silent Retreat, where most guests were traveling solo. Not speaking for a few days felt liberating. However, if the silence is too much, the retreat offers short trips to a nearby hot spring, where talking is allowed.\n\nSafety tips for solo travel\n\nTraveling by yourself can feel hugely freeing. That said, I do take a few safety precautions. Before I go away, I leave a detailed itinerary with my family, including the phone numbers of tour guides and taxi companies I'm using, along with my travel insurance information. If you're a U.S. citizen, you can register trips abroad with the government's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program so you can be contacted if there is an emergency. There is no similar system in the U.K., but the government publishes a list of English-speaking doctors worldwide. I book most of my transfers, accommodations and tours ahead, though I try to leave some flexibility so I can be spontaneous too. When I'm out and about, I wear a cross-body purse and avoid keeping valuables in my pockets. I always pack a spare credit card and extra cash, which l leave in the hotel's safe. When traveling by train, or rickshaw in India, I wore a money belt under my pants. Locals advised me not to walk alone late at night in New Orleans, and I made sure to book and wait for taxis indoors rather than on the street.\n\nA cross-body purse is useful for valuables while traveling.

      "title": "Is the humanoid robot industry ready for its ChatGPT moment?",
      "description": "AI-powered humanoid robots are being rolled out across different industries, with some in the industry saying widespread adoption is here.",
      "content": "In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nTwo humanoid robots are on display at the China Mobile booth at the Mobile World Conference in Shanghai on June 19, 2025. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nHumanoid robots, which have made significant technological advances this year, may be at the precipice of a ChatGPT-like spike in investment and popularity — or at least, that's what many in the industry believe. So-called humanoid robots are artificial intelligence-powered machines designed to resemble humans in appearance and movement, with expected use cases across the industrial and service sectors. Makers of these robots have been working on the technology in the background for years. Now, they say they're ready to unleash the technology into the world. \"There is a consensus in our industry that the ChatGPT moment for humanoid robots has arrived,\" Xiong Youjun, general manager at the Beijing Innovation Center for Humanoid Robotics, said during a panel in Singapore on Thursday, alongside other professionals from China's robotics industry.\n\n\"This year has been defined as the first year of mass production of humanoid robots,\" Xiong, chief technology officer and executive director of robotics firm UBTech, said in Mandarin translated by CNBC. He added that there had been rapid progress in both the mechanical bodies and the AI-powered \"brains.\" The original \"ChatGPT moment\" occurred in late 2022, when OpenAI released its groundbreaking generative AI chatbot to the public, leading to mass adoption of large language models and widespread recognition of their potential.\n\nTesla's Optimus robot gestures at an unveiling event in Los Angeles, Oct. 10, 2024. Tesla | Via Reuters\n\nRobotics players hoping to recreate that impact include Tesla's Optimus in the U.S., while a growing number of humanoid robot start-ups are emerging in China, with companies like Unitree, Galbot, Agibot and UBtech Robotics bringing products to market. While humanoid robots are yet to reach a fraction of the adoption seen with generative AI, many experts do expect the technology to have a transformative impact on the global economy in a matter of years. The robots have also begun to appear everywhere, from factories to technology conferences to sporting events.\n\nHumanoids pick up steam\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said he expects the company to produce 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, with the technology expected to eventually make up the majority of the EV maker's business. Meanwhile, humanoid robot firms in China say their products are already being used in factories and for commercial services. Speaking on Thursday, Zhao Yuli, chief strategy officer at Galbot, said the start-up had already deployed almost 1,000 robots across different businesses. Other companies, such as UBTech Robotics and Galbot, have also installed robots in local factories, according to local media reports.\n\nwatch now\n\nAccording to Zhao, these deployments have come alongside a surge of investor interest and government support in the sector, as well as the maturation of both robotics and generative AI technology. Industry experts noted that this maturation in technology has been on display at a number of conferences and events this year, such as China's World Humanoid Robotics Game, which sees robots compete in practical scenarios. Galbot won a gold medal in the Robot Skills event after placing first in a pharmaceutical sorting challenge. Improvements in Chinese humanoid robots' motion control have also been on display in recent months at sporting events such as marathons and boxing matches. Guo Yandong, founder and CEO of AI² Robotics, added that improvements in generative AI have also enabled robots to learn on the job rather than rely solely on preset commands, a shift that could expand the uses of humanoids across sectors.\n\nNot so fast\n\nDespite the hype from humanoid robotics companies, many experts resist the idea that mass public adoption will occur anytime soon. \"Humanoids won't arrive all at once in a ChatGPT moment, but slowly enter more and more positions as their capabilities increase,\" said Reyk Knuhtsen, analyst at SemiAnalysis, an independent research and analysis company specializing in semiconductors and AI. He added that their first uses will be in low-stakes, failure-tolerant tasks. That's not to mention long manufacturing timelines and high costs, which will also slow adoption compared to generative AI, he added.\n\nUBTech humanoid robot is on display during the 27th China Beijing International High-tech Expo at China National Convention Center on May 8, 2025 in Beijing, China.

Not good!!!'\" Trump said.\n\nCurrent regulations require companies to report on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.\n\nDespite Trump's comments about China, companies there have reporting requirements that are similar to the U.S. if not more stringent. Chinese companies must file quarterly earnings reports as well as semiannual and annual reports.\n\nCompanies listed on the Hong Kong exchange, however, only report every six months.\n\nTrump's proposal would be more in line with practices in the UK and European Union, where companies are required to file semiannually but can issue quarterly reports if they choose.\n\nThe wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.\n\nEarlier this year, Norway's sovereign wealth fund proposed switching to semiannual reporting, reasoning that lengthening the time frame would allow companies to focus on the longer term.\n\n(Learn the best 2026 strategies from inside the NYSE with Josh Brown and others at CNBC PRO Live.

      "description": "More drivers are rolling negative equity into new car loans. Here’s how to minimize the cost as much as possible in this situation, experts say.",
      "content": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty Images\n\nHow drivers end up 'underwater'\n\nTo be sure, it's not unusual to see underwater auto loans. You may already be underwater on your loan from the moment you drive out of the dealer with the new vehicle, as cars are depreciating assets, said Brian Moody, senior staff writer at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. But other choices you make, such as taking on a longer loan term or making a smaller down payment, can exacerbate the issue.\n\nwatch now\n\nStill, lengthening an auto loan's terms is \"the one thing consumers can do to decrease costs,\" said Drury. It has gotten to the point where 84-month auto loans have become \"increasingly common,\" he said. In the second quarter of 2025, 84-month auto loans comprised of 21.6% of new auto loans, up from 19.2% the quarter prior, according to Edmunds data provided to CNBC. To compare, 72-month loans were at 36.1% in the second quarter, down from 38.6% in the same timeframe, according to the data. It isn't a problem to have negative equity when you still own and drive the car, Moody said. It becomes an issue when you need to sell or trade it in. Negative equity can also be problematic if your vehicle is totaled. After an accident, your insurer will typically pay the actual cash value of the car. If that's less than what you owe on your loan, you're responsible for the remaining cost.\n\nHow to buy a new car when you're underwater\n\nKeep your current vehicle if you can, experts say, to avoid having to roll that debt into a new loan or come up with cash to cover it. If you truly need a new car, it's important to do preliminary research before you even walk into a car dealership. If you have negative equity from a prior auto loan, rolling it over to a lower-interest car loan can help you save on borrowing costs, Drury said. First, understand what your credit score is, said Moody. Generally speaking, the higher your score, the better the interest rate and loan terms lenders offer you. \"Knowing your credit score and knowing what interest rate you qualify for is important to know upfront,\" Moody said. Try to get pre-approved for different auto loans across several banks or lenders, said Drury. This helps you get a better gauge of the terms you can qualify for and distinguish the best offers. Once you're ready to buy, the auto dealer might either try to match the deals you have or offer better financing options, he said.",

      "title": "More consumers are using rent payments to boost their credit score. Here's what to know",
      "description": "More tenants are reporting their rent payment activity to build their credit history. Here's what to consider before enrolling, experts say.",
      "content": "Miniseries | E+ | Getty Images\n\nWho benefits the most from rent reporting services\n\nRent reporting services track a user's rent payment history and report them to one or more of the three credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. Sharing rent payment activity has shown to be beneficial for participants, especially those who are \"credit invisible,\" or do not have any credit history, experts say. Those who have enrolled typically see their credit scores increase. When rent payments are included in credit reports, consumers see an average growth of 60 points to their credit score, according to a 2021 TransUnion report. Rent reporting services can also help younger adults, as they are more likely to have short credit histories and to rent, said Schulz.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn 2025, about 18% of Gen Zers surveyed reported their rent payments to the credit bureaus, according to TransUnion's report. While that declined from 26% in 2024, it's still the largest share when compared to other generations. About 16% of millennials surveyed reported their rent activity in 2025. That's followed by 12% of polled Gen Xers and 8% of surveyed baby boomers, according to the report. Gen Z made up 15% of TransUnion's 2,006 respondents. Millennials were 28% of the survey base, and Gen X, represented 30%. Baby boomers accounted for 27%.\n\n5 questions to ask before you report your rent payments\n\nHowever, not all rent reporting services work the same way, experts say. For example, while some only share on-time payments, others report late payments as well. If you fall behind, that activity could be also reflected in such tools, negatively affecting your score. Before you enroll in a rent reporting service, consider the negative consequences or the worst-case scenario, like a job loss, said Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Schulz agreed: \"If you are concerned about your job, for example, and unsure if you're going to be able to make your rent payments six months from now, maybe it's not the best time for you to sign up.\" Ask yourself these five questions before enrolling.\n\n1. Do you truly need it?\n\nYou might not even need to leverage rent payments to improve your credit. For those with a thin or non-existent credit file, even a small amount of positive rent history \"can have a really significant impact\" to their credit, Schulz said. But if you already have a long credit history and a good score, adding another data point won't make a significant change, he said. Check your credit score first and assess if reporting your rent payment activity will make a difference, said Wu.\n\n2. What is the cost?\n\nSome rent reporting services are free of charge, while others require a fee that can range from $6.95 to $9.95 a month, according to Apartment List. Services may also charge a one-time enrollment or setup fee that can cost from $25 to $95, the site found. See if rent reporting would come at an additional cost to you or if your landlord covers any of the fees.\n\n3. Does the service report to the three credit bureaus?\n\nMake sure that the service reports to all three of the major credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. Sometimes, rent reporting services will only share the data with one or two of the three bureaus, experts say. That can be an issue down the line when you apply for loans or credit cards, said Schulz. If your lender checks your report from one of the bureaus that are not included in the service, then the reported data \"is largely irrelevant because it won't be seen,\" he said.\n\n4. What data does the service report?\n\nSome services only report on-time, in-full rent payments to credit bureaus, while others might also report late payments, experts say. But even if the servicer only reports positive history, it can be a risk, said Wu. Say you report rent payments for a year and then \"all of a sudden the data stops,\" she said. \"Is a future landlord going to look at that and make assumptions?\" Wu said.\n\n5. What is the cancellation policy?",

      "content": "In this article MCD\n\nCASY Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Wawa store is seen on May 29, 2024 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura | Getty Images\n\nFast-food restaurants are losing breakfast customers to convenience stores. Morning meal traffic to fast-food chains rose 1% in the three months ended in July, while visits to food-forward convenience stores climbed 9% in the same period, according to market research firm Circana. \"Over the long run, convenience stores have taken share, really at foodservice overall, but the morning meal has been their strong suit,\" David Portalatin, Circana senior vice president and foodservice industry advisor, told CNBC, noting the trend has largely been driven by what the group calls \"food-forward convenience stores.\" For decades, McDonald's and its rivals have tried to lure consumers away from home to eat their early morning offerings, betting that convenience and unique items will win over diners. While fast-food chains have made some inroads, 87% of what consumers eat and drink in the morning comes from their own refrigerators or pantries, according to Portalatin. That leaves plenty of opportunity for fast-food chains — and anyone else who wants a slice of the breakfast pie.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A McDonald's Corp. McGriddle breakfast sandwich is displayed for a photograph in New York, U.S. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBefore the pandemic, fast-food chains started seeing a new rival for their breakfast customers: convenience stores. Regional chains like Wawa in the Northeast and Casey's General Store in the Midwest were expanding their reach and investing in their foodservice options, taking pages from the fast-food companies' own playbooks. For a time, lockdowns and the shift to hybrid work reversed those market share gains. But in the three months ended in July, food-forward convenience stores once again gained the upper hand in the battle to serve consumers breakfast, according to Portalatin. Circana separates food-forward convenience stores like Buc-ee's and Sheetz from the broader industry, although more chains may soon fit under that umbrella. 7-Eleven, the biggest convenience, or c-store, in the U.S., is planning to invest more in its prepared foods business, inspired by the success of its Japanese business. C-store chain RaceTrac on Wednesday announced that it's buying Potbelly for about $566 million, although it's unclear what its plans for the sandwich chain include beyond expanding its footprint.\n\nFast-food's breakfast breakdown\n\nIn recent years, more diners have been watching their budgets, conscious of rising menu prices and a tight job market. Year-over-year morning traffic to fast-food chains has fallen every quarter for the last three years, according to data from Revenue Management Solutions, which advises restaurants on how to increase sales and profits. In the second quarter, fast-food breakfast visits fell 8.7%. To see the struggles, look no further than McDonald's, which dominates the quick-service breakfast category. \"... The breakfast daypart is the most economically sensitive daypart, because it's the easiest daypart of a stressed consumer to either skip breakfast or choose to eat breakfast at home,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call in late July. \"And we, as well as the rest of the industry, are seeing that the breakfast daypart is absolutely the weakest daypart in the day.\" McDonald's morning visits accounted for 33.5% of its traffic in the first half of 2019 but fell to 29.9% in the first half of 2025, according to Placer.ai data. To try to drum up traffic, the chain has included breakfast items in its new Extra Value Meals, including a deal for a Sausage McMuffin with Egg with a hash brown and a small coffee for $5. To reverse breakfast's slide, fast-food chains are taking hints from their competition. After years of convenience stores looking to fast-food chains for ideas on how to grow prepared food sales, from installing ordering kiosks to new menu items, the dynamic has flipped. \"[Quick-service restaurants] are looking at late-night sales and early morning sales, and they are directly looking at convenience stores and saying, 'What is working? How can we bring that to our stores?'\" National Association of Convenience Stores spokesperson Jeff Lenard told CNBC.\n\nThe rise of the c-store meal\n\nwatch now\n\nPrepared foods have offered a lifeline for convenience stores as demand for gasoline, tobacco and lottery tickets has fallen over time. The industry's overall foodservice sales reached $121 billion in 2024, according to data from the NACS. Most customers visit the gas pump during the morning and evening rush hours, on their way to and from work, presenting the perfect opportunity for c-stores to sell them breakfast or dinner. This year, 72% of consumers surveyed by Intouch Insight said they saw c-stores as a real alternative to fast-food chains, up from 56% a year ago and 45% two years ago. Broadly, the c-stores that have focused on fresh food have been winning over more customers. For example, Wawa has seen its customer base grow by 11.5% since 2022, while fast-food chains McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's have seen their combined customer base shrink 3.5% in the same time, according to data from Indagari, a transaction data analytics firm. The majority of 1,170 respondents to an Intouch Insight survey for CNBC said that they have purchased made-to-order breakfast from a c-store in the morning in the past three months. Forty-eight percent of respondents said that when they choose breakfast from a convenience store, they are replacing a visit that they might otherwise make to a fast-food restaurant like McDonald's or Dunkin'. Buying coffee and breakfast from a c-store likely won't be cheaper than making it at home. But consumers perceive it as \"good bang for their buck,\" according to Sarah Beckett, vice president of sales and marketing for Intouch Insight. Plus, c-store customers get a wider breadth of options. In addition to coffee, gas stations sell energy drinks, protein shakes and yogurt smoothies. And customers can pick up a granola bar or banana to accompany their breakfast sandwich. Fast-food chains lack that kind of variety. But above all, what matters to consumers is the food itself. \"While [a] convenience store broadly does have some tailwind from being a lower price point, the ultimate differentiator, and what's really going to set apart the winners from losers, is that quality aspect of it,\" Circana's Portalatin said.\n\nSignage at a Casey’s General Store.

      "description": "For Panama Canal, drought is an economic and existential risk. New dam and land bridge projects will help trade move, but won't be ready before next El Niño.",
      "content": "After a historic drought that paralyzed vessel transits through the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Authority is moving ahead with major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate future droughts and the risk of low water levels that in recent years plagued the key global trade gateway.\n\nThe Panama Canal depends on fresh water for its operations and is rainfall dependent.\n\n\"We use about two and a half times the amount of water a city of the size of New York uses for the canal operation,\" Ricaurte Vásquez, Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC.\n\nIn a good year of rain, that means over 50 vessel transits through the canal's locks a day, but in recent years, weather has not cooperated. Severe drought conditions hit the region from late 2022 to 2024, forcing the canal to reduce transits and put in place vessel weight restrictions in an effort to conserve water.\n\nThe canal is critical to the U.S. economy and trade. The U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal, with total U.S. commodity export and import containers representing about 73% of Panama Canal traffic, and 40% of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year. In all, roughly $270 billion in cargo is handled annually.\n\nIn April, Canal administration began the pre-qualification and selection process for concessionaires to build a land bridge, including what it describes as a flagship natural gas pipeline line to move natural gas liquids (NGLs) without relying on the canal itself. A road connecting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as port terminals built on either coast, would also be constructed, with the terminals also able to accommodate containers and roll-on and roll-off cargo.\n\nThe pipeline would allow for the transport of liquified petroleum gas, ethane, butane, and propane from the Atlantic side to a Pacific-side terminal, where another vessel would be loaded and carry the product to Asia. Canal officials hope this will attract more LNG transits through the canal.\n\nThe Panama Canal Authority reported a 29% drop in vessel transits during fiscal year 2024, with the biggest hits in LNG and dry bulk transits. LNG transits were down 66 percent, while dry bulk transits were down 107 percent.\n\nEven though water levels are back to regular operating conditions, LNG traffic has not returned to pre-drought transit activity, with carriers continuing to choose the longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, according to S&P Global data.\n\nVasquez tells CNBC that U.S. energy companies are \"drooling at the possibilities\" of this alternative way to move the commodity. Transit time-wise, Vasquez said the pipeline would be competitive versus traversing the canal, and reliability would be higher because it is now water-dependent. \"This is important because with many of these products, reliability and delivering on time are critical,\" he said.\n\n\"We decided to do a land bridge to complement the waterway,\" Vásquez said. \"We are aware that these are high-value products that have a destination in Asia,\" he said, noting the project was announced in Tokyo, which is the largest buyer of these energy products.",

He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAlongside its new iPhone 17 lineup, Apple casually launched a world’s first last week inside the very dull sounding “Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max.” It’s the first charger to support the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, giving you some of the benefits of a more powerful 60W charger in a compact 40W package.\n\nAVS — which stands for Adjustable Voltage Supply — provides granular voltage options allowing the power source to offer more precise and efficient charging of devices like smartphones and laptops. You can see it listed on the charger specs from Apple Insider’s hands-on.\n\nFor reasons of safety, efficiency, and longevity, the batteries in our phones and laptops do not charge at their maximum possible input for the entirety of the charging cycle. Instead it’s regulated at predefined voltages to slow down charging as the battery fills. With AVS, the power source can provide a very specific voltage that is closer to the ideal needed for the device being charged, speeding up charging without overheating.\n\nHowever, unlike a true 60W charger, Apple’s little 40W GaN charger can not maintain that peak 60W rate forever — only 18 minutes as demonstrated by Privaterbok over at the r/UsbCHardware subreddit. That makes it suitable for fast charging a new iPhone 17 but not a MacBook Pro, which is why Apple sells it as a 40W charger “with 60W Max” and not a 60W charger.\n\nIt also means that you might need Apple’s $39 Dynamic Power Adapter if you want to match Apple’s fast charging claim for the iPhone 17 models (“up to 50 percent in 20 minutes”) or wait for Anker and others to provide a compatible USB PD 3.2 AVS charger of their own.",

Today, Seagate announced an updated version of the LaCie Rugged Mini SSD with a few small design tweaks and a big boost to transfer speeds.\n\nThe drive is now called the LaCie Rugged SSD4 and is available starting today in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities (Seagate is dropping the 500MB option) for $134.99, $249.99, and $479.99, respectively.\n\nThe new Rugged SSD4 introduces a few small design tweaks including a brushed aluminum finish. Image: Seagate\n\nThe Rugged SSD4 is exactly the same size as its predecessor but now features a brushed aluminum finish and a centered USB-C port. It now supports transfer speeds up to 40Gbps with 4,000MB/s read speeds and 3,000MB/s write speeds. Seagate’s older Rugged Mini SSD had a USB-C port that was slightly off-center, a smoother aluminum finish, and read speeds that maxed out at 2,000MB/s.\n\nThe new drive isn’t quite as fast as the LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5 that was introduced earlier this year at CES with 6,700MB/s read and 5,300MB/s write speeds, but when it’s connected to a USB-C iPhone, the Rugged SSD4 is fast enough to capture ProRes 4K footage at 120fps.\n\nAs with the previous version, the new Rugged SSD4 has an IP54 rating against dust and water, but it’s definitely not waterproof so while splashes are okay, a complete dunking would not be. Its orange bumper also protects it from drops as high as nearly 10 feet, but that’s definitely not an invitation to casually toss it around.",

      "description": "The AirPods Pro are about as ubiquitous as earbuds can get. Step outside your door, and you're almost certain to see people wearing them. For good reason, too. Their active noise cancelling (ANC) is excellent for the price, sound quality is great, and they're comfortable and convenient. If it ain't broke, why fix it? After [&#8230;]",
      "content": "is a senior reporter and author of the Optimizer newsletter.She has more than 13 years of experience reporting on wearables, health tech, and more. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nThe AirPods Pro are about as ubiquitous as earbuds can get. Step outside your door, and you’re almost certain to see people wearing them. For good reason, too. Their active noise cancelling (ANC) is excellent for the price, sound quality is great, and they’re comfortable and convenient. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? After all, messing with a winning formula just for the sake of change often ends up in disappointment.\n\nThat’s not the case with the $249.99 AirPods Pro 3. Of all the shiny new gadgets Apple launched last week, this is the sole no-brainer upgrade. Everything you liked about the AirPods Pro just got better — and so did everything you didn’t.\n\nBetter fit\n\nThe second-gen Pro was more or less about refining the software and sound; the overall design didn’t change. But while the AirPods Pro 3 look familiar at a glance, pop them in your ear and you’ll feel the difference. The new buds and tips are more angled, so they slot more naturally into your ear canal. You can twist them in for a more secure fit, whereas the last AirPods Pro would pop out unless you put them in just right.\n\nAnother plus: Apple now includes five ear tip sizes, adding an XXS size so you have a better chance of finding a comfy fit. That said, I would temper any expectations regarding the “foam-infused” tips. These aren’t your traditional foam tips, which expand to fit your ear more securely. What Apple’s done here is more of a hybrid approach. The front portion has some foam that subtly expands, but the majority of the tip is silicone for comfort and easier cleaning.\n\nYou can see the difference between the AirPods Pro 3 (top) versus the AirPods Pro 2. And the other side. The third-gen buds have a new shape to better fit ears.\n\nFit has always been one of the biggest complaints with AirPods, regardless of model. Whenever I come across AirPods haters, the usual reasons are either that the buds are too uncomfortable or they simply slip out. My spouse has bought multiple pairs over the years because the buds are always falling out of their ears. Nary a day goes by that I don’t find them crouching next to the bed or sofa, phone flashlight out, searching underneath for a missing AirPod. With these, they immediately declared, “They fit so much better!” and proceeded to pre-order their own pair. I’ve heard similar reactions from fellow reviewers who also had issues with the fit on prior AirPods Pro.\n\nStill, that’s not a huge sample size, and everyone’s ear shape is unique. While I think the Pro 3 will fit more people, I still recommend trying a pair before committing if you’ve had issues in the past. But as someone who hasn’t, these fit me better too.\n\nWorld’s best ANC?\n\nAt Apple’s keynote last week, Apple executives kept saying these things had the “world’s best ANC” for wireless in-ear headphones. The claim is that the active noise cancellation in the third-gen buds is twice as good as the second gen, and four times better than the originals. The sound quality is also purportedly better due to a redesigned internal architecture that Apple says improves airflow for better bass.\n\nNow, I’m not an audio engineer, but I did put the AirPods Pro 3’s ANC through a series of real-life tests alongside my personal pair of AirPods Pro 2. It’s pretty damn good.\n\nThe first test was a six-and-a-half hour flight from San Francisco to New York. Both pairs of buds performed well, but the third-gen were noticeably better. The dull hum of the plane was completely eliminated, though I could still hear announcements if I didn’t have audio playing. (That’s typical for any ANC headphones, however, especially earbuds.)\n\nThe case for the AirPods Pro 3 also has stronger Find My capabilities this year.\n\nMy second test was sitting in my kitchen while my spouse and in-laws were fixing our broken garbage disposal and running the laundry. Again, the second and third-gen buds were comparable, but the latter were notably better at dampening higher frequencies like voices and my cats yowling for kibble. If I put my tunes on, I couldn’t hear anything.\n\nI also tested the active noise cancellation at a Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson concert against the Loop Experience 2 and EarPeace Music passive earplugs, which reduce noise by 17db and 20db respectively. The third-gen buds outperformed the Loop Experience 2, and were roughly on par with the Earpeace Music. I normally wouldn’t use AirPods in lieu of earplugs at a concert, but it’s nice to know that they’ll do in a pinch.\n\nAs for sound quality, the improvement is subtle but definitely there. I noticed it most while listening to the K-Pop Demon Hunters soundtrack. Multi-part vocal harmonies in songs like “Golden,” “Your Idol,” and “What It Sounds Like” are more audible, while the bass lines are punchier. Despite listening to this album on repeat since June with the AirPods Pro 2, I noticed new elements in the sound production, like faint bubble-popping effects in the catchy “Soda Pop.” I had a similar experience listening to old favorites. And while I still think spatial audio is gimmicky outside of a Vision Pro, I can appreciate that sound quality has been subtly improved on Dolby Atmos tracks as well. Ultimately, you’ll notice a richer overall listening experience regardless of whether you’re listening to music or watching an immersive movie.\n\nSpecs Sensors: Dual beamforming microphones, inward-facing microphone, skin-detecting sensor, motion-detecting accelerometer, speech-detecting accelerometer, heart rate sensor, touch control. Chips: H2 headphone chip, U2 chip in charging case Dust and water resistance: IP57 Battery: Estimated 8 hours of listening time with ANC, 7.5 hours with Spatial Audio and Head tracking enabled. 6.5 hours with heart rate sensing during workouts. 10 hours in Transparency mode. 24 hours with the case. Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3\n\nCalls sound “generically good,” according to a friend I called while walking along a windy highway full of bustling cars. They weren’t able to hear any of the wind or environmental noise, even though the ANC wasn’t able to wipe them out entirely for me.\n\nANC is power-intensive, but I was pleased to see the third-gen buds have improved battery life. I wore them with ANC enabled for five hours of my flight, plus a 10-minute wait at baggage claim and a 40-minute Uber ride home. I still had 27 percent battery left by the time I got home. Altogether, my usage roughly tracks with Apple’s eight-hour estimate for ANC listening time on a single charge.\n\nHands-free fitness tracking\n\nPerhaps the biggest hardware update for the AirPods Pro 3 is the addition of a heart rate sensor, enabling fitness tracking without an Apple Watch. It’s not a huge surprise, given that Apple added heart rate sensors to the Powerbeats Pro 2 earlier this year. But the AirPods Pro do a lot more with the feature.\n\nFor starters, you can track your heart rate during 50 types of workouts directly from the native iOS Fitness app. On the Powerbeats, this was limited to a handful of partner apps at launch. This is great news for folks with wrist tattoos, which get in the way of smartwatch sensors, or those who’d rather not wear smart rings, chest straps, or smartwatches for sports like boxing or weight lifting. It’s also a boon for anyone who routinely forgets their Apple Watch while on walks.\n\nYou can choose to track workouts with the Apple Watch or with just the AirPods Pro 3.\n\nApple’s Fitness Plus app can display heart rate data from the AirPods Pro 3 — a strange omission from the Powerbeats at launch. Crucially, the AirPods can also act as a secondary heart rate data stream when used with the Apple Watch. Previously, apps always deferred to the Apple Watch over the Powerbeats. Now, Apple’s introduced an algorithm that will analyze which of the two heart rate data streams has a stronger signal in a given activity, and prefer that one. Some good news: Apple isn’t gatekeeping these improvements to the AirPods. It’s since announced these updates will also come to the Powerbeats in iOS 26.\n\nI tried Pro 3-only tracking for two outdoor walks and found that the heart rate tracking was comparable to a chest strap, within roughly 5 to 10 beats per minute. Accuracy will heavily depend on a secure fit, but I never had issues getting readings, even when I got sweaty. Some more good news on that front: the buds now have IP57 sweat and water resistance. I wouldn’t dunk my head in a pool while wearing them, but they might stand a better chance of surviving the wash or a sudden downpour.\n\nSemi-lost in translation\n\nAs part of Apple Intelligence, the AirPods Pro 3 (along with the Pro 2 and AirPods 4) will support live translations for a handful of languages. I’ve always wanted the Babel fish from Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy to be real, so I was stoked to try this out. Compared to phones or smartwatches, earbuds feel like a more natural choice for live translation tech.\n\nSorry to burst any bubbles. This live translation feature is no Babel fish, though I can see it being useful in a handful of scenarios.\n\nThe feature was impressive in a live demo Apple gave me where a Spanish speaker gave a short speech. I activated Live Translation via the iPhone’s Action Button and voilá. (You can also activate by pinching both AirPods’ stems). The speaker’s voice was dampened and after a short, intentional delay, Apple Intelligence crisply translated what was being said on-device. You and your conversation partner can either both use AirPods for translation, or if they don’t have a pair, you can also view a transcript of the translated conversation on your iPhone. And if it worked like this every single time, I’d cry tears of joy.\n\nYou can view a transcript of a conversation via the iPhone You can also start a live translation session from the phone… Or via touch controls. You just have to press the stems of each earbud.\n\nBut real-life conversations are a bit different. They’re not always calm. They’re full of ums and uhs, and I doubt there’s any child of immigrants who hasn’t heard an auntie rattle off at the speed of light. So I called up my cousin’s spouse, who is a fluent German speaker, to see how this feature would handle translation without guardrails. To both of our surprise, it actually worked quite well for conversational German. It was even able to accurately translate when he spoke in German slang in an Austrian accent — something he said might be hard for a native German speaker. (He likened it to hearing someone with a thick Scottish accent.) It only stumbled when he would occasionally switch back to English to comment on accuracy.\n\nThe feature isn’t limited to in-person conversations only, however. It works with any audio you’re hearing in person, meaning you should be able to use it for public announcements while traveling, video calls, or foreign-language media. To test this, I watched a scene from the German film Der Untergang featuring an epic meltdown from Hitler in the last days of his dictatorship. I chose this scene precisely because the actor speaks quickly and with emotion, changing thoughts mid-sentence, and there’s cross-talk from other characters. (And because I could compare the translation with the official subtitles.)\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n1 / 3 You can get the gist even if it’s not quite right.\n\nThe translation feature performed admirably, but struggled to recognize character names or account for abrupt pauses in dialogue. Sometimes it identified the words correctly but used the wrong meaning for the context. For example, a line that Live Translation presented as “Steiner could not massage enough forces for an attack” is translated in the movie’s subtitles as “Steiner didn’t have enough force to attack.” A more literal translation would be “Steiner couldn’t amass enough forces for the attack.” There are multiple ways you can translate the word that became “massage,” but Live Translation picked the wrong one.\n\nThis isn’t an Apple limitation; I’ve seen it across all AI translation tech. But while live translation works well enough to convey broad meaning, it’s hard to say whether people will use this as intended. I’ve lived abroad and have a multilingual family. To me, using AirPods makes most sense in trying to translate announcements, museum tours where multilingual options aren’t available, or media that may not yet have subtitles. In face-to-face human interaction, most people are happy to gesture or point to a translation app on their phones. And in business meetings where the absolute correct meaning is crucial, it’s hard to beat seasoned interpreters. I’ll be curious to try this out during an upcoming trip to Italy, but I have the sense that doing so will also come with a healthy dose of anxiety and self-consciousness.\n\nNow that I’ve used the AirPods Pro 3, I can’t go back.\n\nA no-brainer upgrade\n\nLet me preface this by saying you shouldn’t run out and buy these if your AirPods Pro 2 are working perfectly fine. There’s no reason to throw out a good pair of earbuds. Ideally, I’d ask that everyone exercise restraint and only upgrade when their current AirPods finally crap out or are genuinely in need of replacement. (If you’re coming from the original AirPods Pro, you’ve got a much better case for upgrading.)\n\nBut I also know how gadget nerd brains work. If you’re going to ignore me, yes this is a worthy upgrade. I wrote ahead of last week’s event that Apple should lean into giving people what they want, and they’ve done that with the AirPods Pro 3. I have next to no complaints, and the only downside I can think of is perhaps the improved fit still won’t work for everyone. The price is the same, the new additions are smart, and most importantly, the sound quality and ANC are top-notch for earbuds.\n\nI’m happy with my AirPods Pro 2, but I won’t lie. Now that I’ve experienced the AirPods Pro 3, I can’t go back. I’ll be ordering a pair for myself once I return this review unit.\n\nAgree to continue: AirPods Pro 3 Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we’re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate. Like any other Bluetooth earbuds, the AirPods Pro can technically be set up and used without you agreeing to anything in software. With the new heart rate tracking feature, however, you may optionally be asked to agree to third-party privacy policies and terms of service if you agree to share that data (i.e., Ladder, Runna, etc.) Apple’s warranty agreement Final tally is one mandatory agreement.",

      "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nQualcomm has announced that its upcoming flagship mobile chipset is the “Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5,” a confusingly named successor to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. While the processor itself will be unveiled during the Snapdragon Summit on September 23rd-25th, Qualcomm has already published an explanation for the branding update.\n\n“It might look like we skipped generations, but the truth is simpler— and more powerful. Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 marks the fifth generation of our premium 8-series platforms since we introduced our new single-digit naming and visual identity, ” Qualcomm said in a blog post. “So, while the naming may look new, it’s actually a continuation of our established framework.”\n\nThis move aims to make the generational Snapdragon mobile chip lineup easier for consumers to understand. After releasing the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3, Qualcomm broke its naming conventions with last year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is technically the fourth generation of the Snapdragon 8-series. Reintroducing generation numbers will help to make it clearer that these products all exist within the same family and release timeline, while (perhaps not coincidentally) avoiding the number four — which is considered to be unlucky in Chinese culture.\n\nTo Qualcomm’s credit, this is less confusing than the numerical branding it previously used for its Snapdragon mobile chips, but it’s amusing that it still had to justify the switch to people who were expecting this to be called the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is poised to rival Apple’s new A19 Pro chipset, and is expected to power the next generation of flagship Android phones, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series and the OnePlus 15.",

      "content": "We only just put Apple’s iPhone 17 launch event behind us, but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is already glancing into his crystal ball to see what’s next for the company. In today’s Power On newsletter Gurman says that there are at least 10 more products from Apple that are expected to launch either later this year or in the first half of 2026.\n\nSome of those products have been rumored for some time, or are just kind of obvious upgrades. The M5 iPad Pro, for instance, is a matter of when not if. Though the rumors that it will have a second front facing camera for those that prefer to use their iPad in portrait mode is interesting. The iPad Pro could be the first Apple product with an M5 as it’s expected to launch in October, with upgraded MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to follow in early 2026.\n\nGurman also claims that a budget-friendly iPhone 17e is in the works for early next year. Upgrades over the 16e are expected to be pretty minor, with most of the handset remaining the same, but moving to the new A19 chip inside the iPhone 17 line. The Apple TV and HomePod mini are also expected to get updates next year with processor bumps along with support for the new version of Siri and Apple Intelligence features. Same with the Vision Pro, which is expected to get an M4 processor and an improved headband, but otherwise remain largely unchanged while a larger update is in the works for 2027.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing on the list is the long-rumored smart home hub code-named J490. Early chatter suggested that the smart display would launch this past March but, clearly, the device never materialized. Now Gurman claims it should launch in the spring. It would mark the first new major product category for Apple in a while, but one that it’s largely laid the groundwork for between the HomePod and iPad.\n\nRounding out the rumors are AirTag 2 and a pair of new monitors. Updated AirTags will have better range thanks to a new wireless chip. Less is known about the monitors, but the code-names of J427 and J527 suggest we could be looking at a pair of 27-inch displays. The Pro Display XDR and Studio display are both getting on in years, with the Pro having been released at the tail end of 2019.",

      "description": "How a Harvard Law grad turned YC founder raised $48M to fight brand abuse in the AI era",
      "content": "When Mark Lee was a law student at Harvard, a trademark class exposed him to the staggering scale of counterfeiting, an illicit industry worth more than $3 trillion annually, and set him on an unexpected path to entrepreneurship.\n\n“I was always broadly interested in technology and startups, but I never really thought I’d be an entrepreneur. I assumed I was set to become a lawyer; most of my family members are lawyers, and practicing law felt like a natural path,” Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. But when he got to Harvard Law, the education wasn’t quite what he expected, Lee said, adding that he began to question whether a career as a corporate lawyer was the right fit.\n\n“So I started exploring different ideas. One day, I took a trademark class and learned that counterfeiting is the world’s largest criminal enterprise, $3 trillion in counterfeit products traded every year, about 8% of global commerce. What struck me was that during COVID, as everything was moving online, this already massive market was growing 20% a year, fueled by marketplaces and social media,” Lee continued. “I saw it as a universal problem—and one that could be solved with the technology I was passionate about at the time: computer vision.”\n\nThat insight became the seed for MarqVision, the company he later co-founded in 2021. The name itself reflects its origins: “Marq” from trademark, and “Vision” from computer vision. The mission was straightforward but ambitious: harness AI-powered computer vision to fight counterfeiting and trademark infringement on a global scale.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and the LA-headquartered AI startup has closed a $48 million Series B round, bringing its total capital raised to about $90 million.\n\nRoughly half of the fresh capital will go toward expanding its AI and engineering teams to accelerate automation and integrate generative AI across its product suite. Another $10 million is earmarked for making the platform enterprise-ready as the company moves upmarket to target larger brands, while an additional $10 million will fund regional expansion.

While many early-stage companies are experimenting with AI to disrupt labor-intensive service industries, very few have reached the early growth stage with the scale and traction.”\n\nMarqVision serves more than 350 customers worldwide across industries ranging from fashion and luxury to gaming, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, automotive, and consumer electronics. The startup reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue within eight months, $10 million in three years, and recently crossed $20 million after four years, doubling annually along the way.\n\n“Our goal is $100M ARR by mid-2027,” Lee said. “Growth could have been faster, but we prioritized two things: delivering the best customer experience and building a scalable AI-driven foundation. As a managed service, we can monetize many offerings, but everything ties back to one core promise—helping global brands control their digital presence and grow revenue.”\n\nOnce considered an unappealing category in technology, “services” is being redefined by AI, which brings software-like scalability and efficiency. This shift has fueled investor interest, with Peak XV, HSG, and Salesforce Ventures backing the company’s vision. The rise of large language models has reframed its positioning from a “software company with humans in the loop” to a leader in the emerging AI-led services space, drawing strong competition in its latest funding round.\n\nMarqVision started out fighting counterfeits, using AI to spot and remove fake products online. As the technology advanced, the startup shifted its focus toward helping brands directly recover lost revenue. Today, many clients report a roughly 5% boost in sales, making the platform valuable not just to legal teams but also to go-to-market organizations tracking revenue impact, according to Lee.\n\nWhen Lee first pitched MarqVision, he envisioned a $5 billion software company, selling $50,000 tools to 10,000 IP teams worldwide. But YC partner Michael Seibel urged him to think bigger — beyond software — by reimagining how IP and brand professionals work. MarqVision has since expanded into end-to-end managed services, an opportunity Lee now believes is 100 times larger than his original plan.\n\nBrand protection typically involves detecting and removing infringements like counterfeits and impersonations, while brand control goes further, giving companies the ability to manage their presence across e-commerce, social media, websites, and chat platforms, Lee noted. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes brand intelligence, offering insights into supply chains, pricing strategies, and reseller networks.\n\n“Our vision is to be the backbone of every global brand that owns IP — becoming the AI-led services platform for IP, content, and brand professionals worldwide,” Lee said.",

      "description": "\"Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.\" That's the very obvious understatement that announced the reopening of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning.

      "content": "“Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.” That’s the very obvious understatement that announced the reopening of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning. On Friday it was discovered that Tyler Robinson, arrested for the alleged killing of Charlie Kirk, had inscribed messages on the casings of several bullets found at the crime scene. One of those read “Hey fascist! Catch!” accompanied by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow, and three down arrows, a reference to the code to call down the 500KG Bomb stratagem in the cooperative shooter Helldivers 2.\n\nUnsurprisingly, within minutes the official subreddit and Discord servers were thrown into chaos. Moderators quickly locked the Helldivers subreddit, pointing to a high number of posts that violated its rule against “Real-World Political Discussions.” Similarly, references to Robinson, Kirk, or the 500KG Bomb stratagem were quickly deleted on the Discord server, and some users speculated the code had been flagged for autodeletion. (Arrowhead Game Studios, makers of the Helldivers series, hasn’t released a public statement about the incident and didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Users merely asking why the subreddit was locked were shut down — “We are not allowed to discuss, I would suggest looking elsewhere,” one user was told.\n\nOnline and in conversations with The Verge, Helldivers fans mostly seemed confused and a little concerned about what might come along with all of this sudden attention. “I just don’t want to see a community I love get slandered to no fault of their own,” one Discord user, Inferionix, wrote.\n\nHelldivers is hardly the first piece of media tied to an act of violence; the Columbine High School shooting famously put an unwelcome spotlight on Doom as commentators searched for a meaning behind the attack. But Kirk’s slaying inspired widespread calls for retaliatory violence by Republicans, making the still-ongoing search for Robinson’s motive particularly high-stakes. Even discussing it is risky, as lawmakers and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk are surveilling social media to police social media users’ responses to Kirk’s death, demanding firings at employers including Microsoft. The subreddit mods said in their reopening post that nobody was banned during the initial flood of shooting-related comments, but anyone who discusses it in the future will be.\n\nOne brief bastion where fans of the game could share their feelings was the Helldivers 2 subreddit, which doesn’t have the same strict ban on real life political discussions. A megathread there, at least for a while, was filled mostly was fans marveling at just how surreal the situation was. “Waking up and hearing a sitting governor of the United States say ‘Notices bulge OwO whats this?’ was a goddamn flashbang,” Reddit user Snaxwheels wrote, referring to one of the other, non-Helldivers-related inscriptions. But eventually that thread was also removed after moderators felt it had gotten out of hand.\n\nSome posters there expressed concern that the attention could reignite the culture war around violent video games. One even pointed out that RFK Jr. had recently revived a largely dismissed theory linking violent games to school shootings. Isadora, an active community member who spoke with The Verge, was more dubious. “Givin [sic] the short news cycles and the fact that such a large portion of MAGAs youth base are among the [conservative games streamer] Asmongold/gamergate type I don’t see the admin and its media machine coming super hard against the game itself.”\n\nOne outstanding question is what — if anything — Robinson thought about Helldiver’s politics. The series, which draws from Robert Heinlein’s Starship Troopers and Paul Verhoeven’s film adaptation, is a satire where players take the role of brainwashed military grunts fighting to spread “managed democracy” for a quasi-fascist Super Earth government. Isadora calls the gameplay the biggest draw, but “its politics is what made me fall in love with it,” they said. “I’m a big Paul Verhoeven fan and Starship Troopers was one of my favorites.”\n\nAs with other satires on authoritarianism, like Warhammer 40K, there’s a persistent discussion about whether some players get the joke. Isadora, largely, thinks they do. “I’m sad that this community has been drug into this as I think the game’s ironic criticism of fascism is a great outlet for so many people,” they told The Verge. “It reflects negatively on a community that largely understands the criticisms it lays out.”\n\nHelldivers will almost certainly go down as a footnote in Kirk’s death. But for some players, the strangeness of using the 500KG Bomb combo — or having it as a tattoo — might linger. One Redditor suggested starting a petition to encourage Arrowhead to change the button command. Most disagreed, littering his message with thumbs down and big red X reactions. “Please don’t bring it here,” said the only reply.",

      "content": "Well, I was wrong, and I did manage to make it to one last day at the Toronto International Film Festival. One of the movies I wanted to see the most this year was Scarlet, the latest from Mamoru Hosoda, whose most recent film was the metaverse fairy tale Belle. Whereas that film was a reimagining of Beauty and the Beast, Scarlet is a twist on Hamlet that’s full of bold, creative ideas. I mostly enjoyed it, but unfortunately it’s saddled with an ending that doesn’t really fit.\n\nI also managed to squeeze in two other films: a Korean revenge / heist thriller, and a Norwegian film about connecting through art. You can read my thoughts on all three below.\n\nThat’s a lot to squeeze into one festival, and I appreciate everyone who followed along. Now I’m gonna take a nap.\n\nProject Y\n\nEven though the opening makes it clear everything turns out relatively OK, Project Y remains riveting and unpredictable throughout. It starts out as a heist movie. Two best friends (Han So-hee and Jun Jong-seo) have worked hard for years and are about to retire from their awful jobs for good, but then they run into a sequence of scams that completely wipe out their savings. So when they hear about a hidden cache of cash, they can’t resist. They get caught, of course, and the film shifts into revenge mode. There are a few implausible moments along the way, but Project Y has an unrelenting kind of tension that’s strengthened by an absolutely vicious villain (Kim Sung-cheol). Just be warned: there are some very gruesome torture sequences.\n\nNo word yet on a wider theatrical release.\n\nScarlet\n\nScarlet (Mana Ashida) is a young princess in 16th century Denmark who finds her life turned upside down when her uncle kills her father to take the crown for himself. The set-up is basically Hamlet, but the twist is that much of the film takes place in the afterlife. It’s a space known as the “otherworld” — neither heaven nor hell, but instead a wasteland where people struggle to get by, and a massive, ancient dragon prowls the skies smiting people with bolts of lightning. The fantasy element of the film is strong, as is Scarlet’s single-minded quest for revenge. But the film unravels towards the end, with a happy ending that feels very out of place.\n\nIn theaters in Japan on November 21st; no word yet on a global theatrical release.\n\nSentimental Value\n\nSisters Nora (Renate Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas) try to come to grips with a troubled childhood after their mostly absentee father Gustav (Stellan Skarsgard) reenters their lives following their mother’s death. It’s an understated but powerful film from Worst Person in the World director Joachim Trier, and it happens in part through understanding trauma through art, as Gustav is a legendary film director attempting to make his most personal movie yet. Sentimental Value is filled with gut punch moments like when Nora asks her sibling “why didn’t our childhood ruin you?” But it brings it all together in a way that feels genuinely hopeful and touching.\n\nIn theaters on November 7th.",

The company claims that the AI Overviews that often appear at the top of search results leave users with little reason to click through to the source, hurting traffic and illegally benefitting from the work of its reporters.\n\nWhile Penske Media is the biggest name to take on Google over its AI Overviews, it’s not the first. Online education company Chegg sued Google in February, as did a group of independent publishers in Europe. The News / Media Alliance has also spoken out about the feature, calling it the “definition of theft” and seeking action from the DOJ.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda defended the summaries to the Wall Street Journal saying, “with AI Overviews, people find search more helpful and use it more.” But Penske and other publishers say there is little reason to follow the links provided in search results and, as a result, they have seen significant drops in traffic and revenue. Penske claims in the suit that revenue from affiliate links is down by over 1/3 this year, and it attributes that directly to a drop in traffic from Google.\n\nThe company also claims it’s in a tough situation. It can either block Google from indexing its content, essentially removing itself from all search results, which would further devastate its business. Or, it can continue to provide training material to Google for its AI, “adding fuel to a fire that threatens PMC’s [Penske Media Corporation] entire publishing business,” the complaint states, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

      "content": "is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.\n\nI would not call the time I’m having with Hollow Knight: Silksong “fun,” and yet I’m still playing.\n\nIn the depths of The Marrow, the second major area of Silksong, there’s a particularly nasty midboss. I eventually beat him, but my reward wasn’t a new ability, item, or a bench where I could rest and save my progress. All I got was pain, suffering, and death. In Silksong, the only way out is through, but the “through” is a tunnel lined with spikes that occasionally spew gouts of flame.\n\nI should have given up right then and there, but I have not abandoned Silksong the same way I do other unfun games. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t just put Silksong down and chalk it up as another “not for me” game the way Hollow Knight just wasn’t for me. I enjoy Metroidvanias a great deal — Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was one of my favorite games of last year. And for Silksong, I wanted to try Team Cherry’s work again and see if it would finally click. It has, and it’s because of the community (and a lot of spite).\n\nI came to Hollow Knight late, long after the buzz about it had left my social media circle. With Silksong, I’m playing it at the same time as everyone else. My social media feed is full of people who love the game much more than I do, posting tips, commiserating about its moments of bullshit (hello, lantern fruit pogo platforming), and gushing over the adorable Sherma.\n\n“I have only known Sherma for a day and a half…”\n\nWhen I post lamenting the game’s bullshit, I get excited messages from my friends giving me advice on what I should do next. It’s like we’re all doing our own personal let’s plays together while being in each other’s chats. It feels good. I am not alone in my misery, and better yet, I’ve got friends to help. For Silksong it’s worked in such a way that’s kept me playing longer than I would have if I were going this alone.\n\nThis kind of collective, collaborative gaming experience has also taught me a new trick: taking a break. I’ve never been the kind of gamer that stops playing when I can’t overcome an obstacle. I either do something else in the game or keep running at my problem until I figure it out. Now, when I feel myself getting even the slightest bit mad because I was so close (or I thought I was so close) to surmounting a challenge, I turn off the game and come back later. It’s so silly that, once again, the “touch grass” people are right, but the strategy has gotten me through some of the game’s most egregious moments. (If the vendor Shakra wants to leave her post in Greymoor because of something I did, that’s fine. But taking her bench with her that’s in a room right before a brutal combat gauntlet is a unique and dastardly flavor of Silksong bullshit.)\n\nYou see this fight? Bullshit. Image: Team Cherry\n\nAnd when I overcome that bullshit, I get this incredible frisson of thrill. When I easily beat a boss in fewer tries than I’m used to, I feel godly. I’m actually quite tickled to hear Team Cherry is working to nerf some of the early bosses, because those were fine. (It’s the damn pogo platforming!)\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m going to finish Silksong and whatever I feel at the end of that journey will be more like relief than joy. Silksong has shown me I don’t need to feel “happiness” or “joy” to continue playing a game. I just want to feel something — even if that something is pure spite.",

      "content": "In Brief\n\nAI-powered chatbots play a growing role in spiritual life, according to a New York Times story that examines the popularity of religious chatbots and apps.\n\nThe Times notes that an app called Bible Chat has been downloaded more than 30 million times, while another app, Hallow, reached the number one spot in Apple’s App Store last year.\n\nFor the most part, these apps are supposed to point people to religious doctrine and scripture to answer their questions, although at least one website purports to allow users to chat with God. Rabbi Jonathan Roman suggested chatbots could be a “way into faith” for “a whole generation of people who have never been to a church or synagogue.”\n\nHowever, these chatbots are built on top of AI models that are designed to validate users’ opinions, to the point that they can reinforce delusional or conspiratorial thinking. Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M professor who studies the intersection of digital culture and religion, warned that chatbots “tell us what we want to hear.”\n\n“It’s not using spiritual discernment, it is using data and patterns,” Campbell said.",

She’s now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces.\n\nShe called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be “worse than babysitting,” she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.\n\nShe had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools.\n\n“Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review,” she said. “When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nA recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly found that at least 95% of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers.\n\nThese experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.\n\nWorking with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it’s given rise to a new corporate coding job known as “vibe code cleanup specialist.”\n\nTechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go.\n\n“Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, ‘Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,’” Rover said.\n\nCan they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren’t going to tell you. “It doesn’t make the kid less clever,” she continued. “It just means you can’t delegate [a task] like that completely.”\n\n“You’re absolutely right!”\n\nFeridoon Malekzadeh also compared vibe coding to a child.\n\nHe’s worked in the industry for more than 20 years, holding various roles in product development, software, and design. He’s building his own startup and heavily using vibe-coding platform Lovable, he said. For fun, he also vibe codes apps like one that generates Gen Alpha slang for Boomers.\n\nHe likes that he’s able to work alone on projects, saving time and money, but agrees that vibe coding is not like hiring an intern or a junior coder. Instead, vibe coding is akin to “hiring your stubborn, insolent teenager to help you do something,” he told TechCrunch.\n\n“You have to ask them 15 times to do something,” he said. “In the end, they do some of what you asked, some stuff you didn’t ask for, and they break a bunch of things along the way.”\n\nMalekzadeh estimates he spends around 50% of his time writing requirements, 10% to 20% of his time on vibe coding, and 30% to 40% of his time on vibe fixing — remedying the bugs and “unnecessary script” created by AI-written code.\n\nHe also doesn’t think vibe coding is the best at systems thinking — the process of seeing how a complex problem could impact an overall result. AI-generated code, he said, tries to solve more surface-level problems.\n\n“If you’re creating a feature that should be broadly available in your product, a good engineer would create that once and make it available everywhere that it’s needed,” Malekzadeh said. “Vibe coding will create something five different times, five different ways, if it’s needed in five different places. It leads to a lot of confusion, not only for the user, but for the model.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rover finds that AI “runs into a wall” when data conflicts with what it was hard-coded to do. “It can offer misleading advice, leave out key elements that are vital, or insert itself into a thought pathway you’re developing,” she said.\n\nShe also found that rather than admit to making errors, it will manufacture results.\n\nShe shared another example with TechCrunch, where she questioned the results an AI model initially gave her. The model started to give a detailed explanation pretending it used the data she uploaded. Only when she called it out did the AI model confess.\n\n“It freaked me out because it sounded like a toxic co-worker,” she said.\n\nOn top of this, there are the security concerns.\n\nAustin Spires is the senior director of developer enablement at Fastly and has been coding since the early 2000s.\n\nHe’s found through his own experience — along with chatting with customers — that vibe code likes to build what is quick rather than what is “right.” This may introduce vulnerabilities to the code of the kind that very new programmers tend to make, he said.\n\n“What often happens is the engineer needs to review the code, correct the agent, and tell the agent that they made a mistake,” Spires told TechCrunch. “This pattern is why we’ve seen the trope of ‘you’re absolutely right’ appear over social media.”\n\nHe’s referring to how AI models, like Anthropic Claude, tend to respond “you’re absolutely right” when called out on their mistakes.\n\nMike Arrowsmith, the chief technology officer at the IT management software company NinjaOne, has been in software engineering and security for around 20 years. He said that vibe coding is creating a new generation of IT and security blind spots to which young startups in particular are susceptible.\n\n“Vibe coding often bypasses the rigorous review processes that are foundational to traditional coding and crucial to catching vulnerabilities,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nNinjaOne, he said, counters this by encouraging “safe vibe coding,” where approved AI tools have access controls, along with mandatory peer review and, of course, security scanning.\n\nThe new normal\n\nWhile nearly everyone we spoke to agrees that AI-generated code and vibe-coding platforms are useful in many situations — like mocking up ideas — they all agree that human review is essential before building a business on it.\n\n“That cocktail napkin is not a business model,” Rover said. “You have to balance the ease with insight.”\n\nBut for all the lamenting on its errors, vibe coding has changed the present and the future of the job.\n\nRover said vibe coding helped her tremendously in crafting a better user interface. Malekzadeh simply said that, despite the time he spends fixing code, he still gets more done with AI coders than without them.\n\n“‘Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress,” Malekzadeh said, quoting the French theorist Paul Virilio, who spoke about inventing the shipwreck along with the ship.\n\nThe pros far outweigh the cons.\n\nThe Fastly survey found that senior developers were twice as likely to put AI-generated code into production compared to junior developers, saying that the technology helped them work faster.\n\nVibe coding is also part of Spires’ coding routine. He uses AI coding agents on several platforms for both front-end and back-end personal projects. He called the technology a mixed experience but said it’s good in helping with prototyping, building out boilerplate, or scaffolding out a test; it removes menial tasks so that engineers can focus on building, shipping, and scaling products.\n\nIt seems the extra hours spent combing through the vibe weeds will simply become a tolerated tax on using the innovation.\n\nElvis Kimara, a young engineer, is learning that now. He just graduated with a master’s in AI and is building an AI-powered marketplace.\n\nLike many coders, he said vibe coding has made his job harder and has often found vibe coding a joyless experience.\n\n“There’s no more dopamine from solving a problem by myself. The AI just figures it out,” he said. At one of his last jobs, he said senior developers didn’t look to help young coders as much — some not understanding new vibe-coding models, while others delegated mentorship tasks to said AI models.\n\nBut, he said, “the pros far outweigh the cons,” and he’s prepared to pay the innovation tax.\n\n“We won’t just be writing code; we’ll be guiding AI systems, taking accountability when things break, and acting more like consultants to machines,” Kimara said of the new normal for which he’s preparing.\n\n“Even as I grow into a senior role, I’ll keep using it,” he continued. “It’s been a real accelerator for me. I make sure I review every line of AI-generated code so I learn even faster from it.”",

      "description": "From a new slim iPhone Air model to  redesigned AirPods, here's what was announced at this year's Apple event.",
      "content": "Apple hosted its new hardware event today, releasing its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. For the iPhone 17 models, updates included larger screens and an improved camera system, as well as the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that replaces the Plus model.\n\nAnd the company may be announcing more new hardware soon, with Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting that a new iPad Pro, an updated Vision Pro, updated AirTags, a new Apple TV, a new HomePod mini, and updated MacBooks are coming in either 2025 or the first half of 2026.\n\niPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nThe iPhone 17 received a makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It features a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16. It also has a 120 Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60 Hz. The phone also has a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera.\n\nIt comes in new colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.\n\nThe Pro’s upgrades are mainly on the back of the phone. The three rear cameras are now arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone are positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is centered for aesthetic reasons.\n\nNotably, the iPhone 17 Pro switched materials, replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum.\n\nThe iPhone 17 starts at $799 and has a base storage of 256GB. In contrast, the iPhone 16 started at $699 for 128GB. The Pro model costs $1,099, and the Pro Max is $1,199.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Called “TechWoven” cases, these feature a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023.\n\nMissing from the keynote was any mention of an AI-enhanced Siri, which puts Apple way behind Google and its competitors.\n\niPhone Air\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nThe biggest announcement at the event was the debut of Apple’s slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which replaces the iPhone Plus.\n\nThis device has a profile thickness of 5.6 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It also features a 6.6-inch screen and a 120 Hz ProMotion display. The device is eSIM only, which helps the product maintain its sleek design.\n\nThis move appears to be Apple’s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple’s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.\n\nThe device is priced at $999 and will be available in black, white, sky blue, and light gold.\n\nApple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nAfter a two-year wait, Apple announced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, which includes faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. The watch also features a larger display.\n\nHowever, one of the most exciting upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure-monitoring capabilities. This feature notifies users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low.\n\nThe third-generation Apple Watch SE, meanwhile, didn’t receive major updates, aside from an always-on display, thanks to a faster S10 chip.\n\nPrices for the watches are $249 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $399 for the Series 11, and $799 for the Ultra 3.\n\nAirPods Pro 3\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nAfter the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it’s about time for an upgrade. The AirPods Pro 3, priced at $249, features smaller earbuds, improved audio, and a new heart-rate-sensing feature. It also features live translation technology, powered by Apple Intelligence, to help users translate foreign languages in real time.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\n",

      "title": "Karen Hao on the Empire of AI, AGI evangelists, and the cost of belief",
      "description": "OpenAI’s rise isn’t just a business story — it’s an ideological one. On Equity, Karen Hao, author of Empire AI, explores how the cult of AGI has fueled a billion-dollar race, justified massive spending on compute and data, and blurred the line between mission and profit.",
      "content": "At the center of every empire is an ideology, a belief system that propels the system forward and justifies expansion – even if the cost of that expansion directly defies the ideology’s stated mission.\n\nFor European colonial powers, it was Christianity and the promise of saving souls while extracting resources. For today’s AI empire, it’s artificial general intelligence to “benefit all humanity.” And OpenAI is its chief evangelist, spreading zeal across the industry in a way that has reframed how AI is built.\n\n“I was interviewing people whose voices were shaking from the fervor of their beliefs in AGI,” Karen Hao, journalist and bestselling author of “Empire of AI,” told TechCrunch on a recent episode of Equity.\n\nIn her book, Hao likens the AI industry in general, and OpenAI in particular, to an empire.\n\n“The only way to really understand the scope and scale of OpenAI’s behavior…is actually to recognize that they’ve already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation state in the world, and they’ve consolidated an extraordinary amount of not just economic power, but also political power,” Hao said. “They’re terraforming the Earth. They’re rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives. And so you can only describe it as an empire.”\n\nOpenAI has described AGI as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work,” one that will somehow “elevate humanity by increasing abundance, turbocharging the economy, and aiding in the discovery of new scientific knowledge that changes the limits of possibility.”\n\nThese nebulous promises have fueled the industry’s exponential growth — its massive resource demands, oceans of scraped data, strained energy grids, and willingness to release untested systems into the world. All in service of a future that many experts say may never arrive.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nHao says this path wasn’t inevitable, and that scaling isn’t the only way to get more advances in AI.\n\n“You can also develop new techniques in algorithms,” she said. “You can improve the existing algorithms to reduce the amount of data and compute that they need to use.”\n\nBut that tactic would have meant sacrificing speed.\n\n“When you define the quest to build beneficial AGI as one where the victor takes all — which is what OpenAI did — then the most important thing is speed over anything else,” Hao said. “Speed over efficiency, speed over safety, speed over exploratory research.”\n\nImage Credits:Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\n\nFor OpenAI, she said, the best way to guarantee speed was to take existing techniques and “just do the intellectually cheap thing, which is to pump more data, more supercomputers, into those existing techniques.”\n\nOpenAI set the stage, and rather than fall behind, other tech companies decided to fall in line.\n\n“And because the AI industry has successfully captured most of the top AI researchers in the world, and those researchers no longer exist in academia, then you have an entire discipline now being shaped by the agenda of these companies, rather than by real scientific exploration,” Hao said.\n\nThe spend has been, and will be, astronomical. Last week, OpenAI said it expects to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029. Meta said in July that it would spend up to $72 billion on building AI infrastructure this year. Google expects to hit up to $85 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, most of which will be spent on expanding AI and cloud infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, the goal posts keep moving, and the loftiest “benefits to humanity” haven’t yet materialized, even as the harms mount. Harms like job loss, concentration of wealth, and AI chatbots that fuel delusions and psychosis. In her book, Hao also documents workers in developing countries like Kenya and Venezuela who were exposed to disturbing content, including child sexual abuse material, and were paid very low wages — around $1 to $2 an hour — in roles like content moderation and data labeling.\n\nHao said it’s a false tradeoff to pit AI progress against present harms, especially when other forms of AI offer real benefits.\n\nShe pointed to Google DeepMind’s Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold, which is trained on amino acid sequence data and complex protein folding structures, and can now accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acids — profoundly useful for drug discovery and understanding disease.\n\n“Those are the types of AI systems that we need,” Hao said. “AlphaFold does not create mental health crises in people. AlphaFold does not lead to colossal environmental harms … because it’s trained on substantially less infrastructure. It does not create content moderation harms because [the datasets don’t have] all of the toxic crap that you hoovered up when you were scraping the internet.”\n\nAlongside the quasi-religious commitment to AGI has been a narrative about the importance of racing to beat China in the AI race, so that Silicon Valley can have a liberalizing effect on the world.\n\n“Literally, the opposite has happened,” Hao said. “The gap has continued to close between the U.S. and China, and Silicon Valley has had an illiberalizing effect on the world … and the only actor that has come out of it unscathed, you could argue, is Silicon Valley itself.”\n\nOf course, many will argue that OpenAI and other AI companies have benefitted humanity by releasing ChatGPT and other large language models, which promise huge gains in productivity by automating tasks like coding, writing, research, customer support, and other knowledge-work tasks.\n\nBut the way OpenAI is structured — part non-profit, part for-profit — complicates how it defines and measures its impact on humanity. And that’s further complicated by the news this week that OpenAI reached an agreement with Microsoft that brings it closer to eventually going public.\n\nTwo former OpenAI safety researchers told TechCrunch that they fear the AI lab has begun to confuse its for-profit and non-profit missions — that because people enjoy using ChatGPT and other products built on LLMs, this ticks the box of benefiting humanity.\n\nHao echoed these concerns, describing the dangers of being so consumed by the mission that reality is ignored.\n\n“Even as the evidence accumulates that what they’re building is actually harming significant amounts of people, the mission continues to paper all of that over,” Hao said. “There’s something really dangerous and dark about that, of [being] so wrapped up in a belief system you constructed that you lose touch with reality.”",

      "description": "Penske's lawsuit accuses Google of abusing its monopoly power in search to force publishers to support AI summaries.",
      "content": "Google faces a new lawsuit accusing the company of illegally using news publishers’ content to create AI summaries that damage their business.\n\nThe lawsuit comes from Penske Media Corporation (PMC), which owns industry publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, Vibe, and Artforum. While Penske’s suit is the first to target Google and its parent company Alphabet over showing AI-generated summaries in search, both publishers and authors have sued other AI companies over related copyright concerns. Google also is also facing an antitrust complaint over AI Overviews in Europe.\n\n“As a leading global publisher, we have a duty to protect PMC’s best-in-class journalists and award-winning journalism as a source of truth,” said Penske Media CEO Jay Penske in a statement. “Furthermore, we have a responsibility to proactively fight for the future of digital media and preserve its integrity — all of which is threatened by Google’s current actions.”\n\nSince launching its AI Overviews last year, Google has been criticized for threatening the business models of the same publishers it relies on to provide the content needed to create accurate AI summaries and answers.\n\nThe new lawsuit goes farther by accusing Google of continuing to “wield its monopoly to coerce PMC into permitting Google to republish PMC’s content in AI Overviews” and to use that content to train its AI models.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda said in a statement that AI Overviews make Google search “more helpful” and create “new opportunities for content to be discovered.”\n\n“Every day, Google sends billions of clicks to sites across the web, and AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites,” Castañeda said. “We will defend against these meritless claims.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "title": "‘Selling coffee beans to Starbucks’ – how the AI boom could leave AI’s biggest companies behind",
      "description": "The competitive landscape of AI is changing in ways that undermine the advantages of the biggest AI labs.",
      "content": "How much do foundation models matter?\n\nIt might seem like a silly question, but it’s come up a lot in my conversations with AI startups, which are increasingly comfortable with businesses that used to be dismissed as “GPT wrappers,” or companies that build interfaces on top of existing AI models like ChatGPT. These days, startup teams are focused on customizing AI models for specific tasks and interface work, and see the foundation model as a commodity that can be swapped in and out as necessary. That approach was on display especially at last week’s Boxworks conference, which seemed devoted entirely to the user-facing software built on top of AI models.\n\nPart of what is driving this is that the scaling benefits of pre-training — that initial process of teaching AI models using massive datasets, which is the sole domain of foundation models — has slowed down. That doesn’t mean AI has stopped making progress, but the early benefits of hyperscaled foundational models have hit diminishing returns, and attention has turned to post-training and reinforcement learning as sources of future progress. If you want to make a better AI coding tool, you’re better off working on fine-tuning and interface design rather than spending another few billion dollars worth in server time on pre-training. As the success of Anthropic’s Claude Code shows, foundation model companies are quite good at these other fields too — but it’s not as durable an advantage as it used to be.\n\nIn short, the competitive landscape of AI is changing in ways that undermine the advantages of the biggest AI labs. Instead of a race for an all-powerful AGI that could match or exceed human abilities across all cognitive tasks, the immediate future looks like a flurry of discrete businesses: software development, enterprise data management, image generation and so on. Aside from a first-mover advantage, it’s not clear that building a foundation model gives you any advantage in those businesses. Worse, the abundance of open-source alternatives means that foundation models may not have any price leverage if they lose the competition at the application layer. This would turn companies like OpenAI and Anthropic into back-end suppliers in a low-margin commodity business – as one founder put it to me, “like selling coffee beans to Starbucks.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate what a dramatic shift this would be for the business of AI. Throughout the contemporary boom, the success of AI has been inextricable from the success of the companies building foundation models — specifically, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Being bullish on AI meant believing that AI’s transformative impact would make these into generationally important companies. We could argue about which company would come out on top, but it was clear that some foundation model company was going to end up with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nAt the time, there were lots of reasons to think this was true. For years, foundation model development was the only AI business there was — and the fast pace of progress made their lead seem insurmountable. And Silicon Valley has always had a deep-rooted love of platform advantage. The assumption was that, however AI models ended up making money, the lion’s share of the benefit would flow back to the foundation model companies, who had done the work that was hardest to replicate.\n\nThe past year has made that story more complicated. There are lots of successful third-party AI services, but they tend to use foundation models interchangeably. For startups, it no longer matters whether their product sits on top of GPT-5, Claude or Gemini, and they expect to be able to switch models in mid-release without end users noticing the difference. Foundation models continue to make real progress, but it no longer seems plausible for any one company to maintain a large enough advantage to dominate the industry.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nWe already have plenty of indication that there is not much of a first-mover advantage. As venture capitalist Martin Casado of a16z pointed out on a recent podcast, OpenAI was the first lab to put out a coding model, as well as generative models for image and video — only to lose all three categories to competitors. “As far as we can tell, there is no inherent moat in the technology stack for AI,” Casado concluded.\n\nOf course, we shouldn’t count foundation model companies out just yet. There are still lots of durable advantages on their side, including brand recognition, infrastructure, and unthinkably vast cash reserves. OpenAI’s consumer business may prove harder to replicate than its coding business, and other advantages may emerge as the sector matures. Given the fast pace of AI development, the current interest in post-training could easily reverse course in the next six months. Most uncertain of all, the race toward general intelligence could pay off with new breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals or materials science, radically shifting our ideas about what makes AI models valuable.\n\nBut in the meantime, the strategy of building ever-bigger foundation models looks a lot less appealing than it did last year — and Meta’s billion-dollar spending spree is starting to look awfully risky.",

      "description": "Tesla's board chair is defending a proposed 10-year, $1 trillion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk.",
      "content": "In Brief\n\nWith Tesla shareholders set to vote on a proposed 10-year, $1 trillion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk in November, board chair Robyn Denholm spoke to The New York Times to defend what would be the largest pay package in corporate history.\n\nDenholm, who was also on the special committee that put the compensation proposal together, argued that Musk needs to be motivated by extraordinary challenges tied to extraordinary compensation. At the same time, she suggested he’s less interested in the additional wealth that the promised Tesla shares would represent, and more in the voting power.\n\n“I think it’s a little bit weird talking about the dollars when it’s actually the voting influence,” said Denholm, whom The Times described as “occasionally appearing ill at ease” during the interview.\n\nIt might also seem counterintuitive to offer such a massive pay package when Tesla’s profits and vehicle sales are falling, but Denholm insisted that the plan is about “future performance.”\n\n“It’s not about past performance,” she said. “He gets nothing if he doesn’t perform against the goals.”\n\nAs TechCrunch previously noted, the package’s goals are considerably less ambitious than some of the promises Musk has made about Tesla in the past.",

      "description": "The state's landmark safety bill sets new transparency requirements for large AI companies.",
      "content": "California’s state senate gave final approval early on Saturday morning to a major AI safety bill setting new transparency requirements on large companies.\n\nAs described by its author, state senator Scott Wiener, SB 53 “requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety protocols, creates whistleblower protections for [employees] at AI labs & creates a public cloud to expand compute access (CalCompute).”\n\nThe bill now goes to California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign or veto. He has not commented publicly on SB 53, but last year, he vetoed a more expansive safety bill also authored by Wiener, while signing narrower legislation targeting issues like deepfakes.\n\nAt the time, Newsom acknowledged the importance of “protecting the public from real threats posed by this technology,” but criticized Wiener’s previous bill for applying “stringent standards” to large models regardless of whether they were “deployed in high-risk environments, [involved] critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data.”\n\nWiener said the new bill was influenced by recommendations from a policy panel of AI experts that Newsom convened after his veto.\n\nPolitico also reports that SB 53 was recently amended so that companies developing “frontier” AI models while bringing in less than $500 million in annual revenue will only need to disclose high level safety details, while companies making more than that will need to provide more detailed reports.\n\nA number of Silicon Valley companies, VC firms, and lobbying groups have criticized the bill, as well as broader efforts by states to regulate AI. In a recent letter to Newsom, OpenAI did not mention SB 53 specifically but argued that to avoid “duplication and inconsistencies,” companies should be considered compliant with statewide safety rules as long as they meet federal or European standards.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The Trump administration and its allies subsequently called for a 10-year ban on state AI regulation.\n\nAnthropic, meanwhile, has come out in favor of SB 53.\n\n“We have long said we would prefer a federal standard,” said Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark in a post. “But in the absence of that this creates a solid blueprint for AI governance that cannot be ignored.”",
