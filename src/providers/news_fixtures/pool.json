The house was rigged with explosives and a 57-year-old man is suspected of starting the fire as part of a family dispute. His body was later found at a nearby lake and police said he was carrying a backpack apparently containing an \"explosive device\". Officers closed the annual beer festival for much of the day after a letter from the suspect had been found with \"a non-specific bomb threat relating to the Oktoberfest\".",

Local reporters said communications were resuming, while internet monitor Netblocks said network data showed a \"partial restoration\" of connectivity. A source close to the government confirmed to BBC Afghan that the internet was back by order of the Taliban prime minister. The 48-hour blackout disrupted businesses and flights, limited access to emergency services and raised fears about further isolating women and girls whose rights have been severely eroded since the hardline Islamist group swept back to power in 2021.\n\nOne man who visited a number of areas in the capital city Kabul on Wednesday told BBC Afghan: \"Everyone is happy, holding their cell phones and talking to their relatives. \"From women, to men and Talibs [a member of the Taliban], each was talking on phones after services were restored. There are more crowds now in the city.\" Suhail Shaheen, a senior Taliban spokesman in Qatar, said \"all communications\" were restored by Wednesday afternoon. The Taliban government has not given an official explanation for the shutdown.\n\nPeople took to the streets in Kabul to celebrate after internet and phone services were restored",

      "description": "Copenhagen is on alert as EU leaders discuss boosting their defences in response to disruption from drones and Russian war planes.",
      "content": "Danish PM calls for strong answer from EU leaders to Russia's hybrid attacks\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Jessica Parker Europe correspondent in Copenhagen and Paul Kirby Europe digital editor in London Share Save\n\nReuters Denmark has reinforced security for the summit and allies have beefed up air defences\n\nEU leaders are meeting in Copenhagen under pressure to boost European defence after a series of Russian incursions into EU airspace, and days after drones targeted Danish airports. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters that \"from a European perspective there is only one country... willing to threaten us and that is Russia, and therefore we need a very strong answer back\". The incursions have become most acute for countries on the EU's eastern flank such as Poland and Estonia. A number of member states have already backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, then track and destroy Russian drones.\n\nDenmark has beefed up security for the summit, banning all civilian drone flights until Friday and placing heavy restrictions on traffic in Copenhagen. Denmark is also hosting a broader European Political Community summit on Thursday and international allies have lent support to ensure both events pass without incident. Copenhagen airport, followed by several Danish airports and military sites on the Jutland peninsula, faced drone disruption last week. Ten allies are providing anti-drone and surveillance support, according to Denmark's military, which has highlighted an \"increased presence of foreign troops and equipment\". Among the countries contributing are Poland, the UK, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the US. A German frigate has also docked in Copenhagen. As host to dozens of European leaders over two days, Denmark will want to fend off any more unwelcome surprises in its air space. Danish police have not found any evidence that Russia was behind last week's drone disruption, but Frederiksen linked it explicitly to other hybrid attacks such as Russia's drone incursion over Poland. It was part of a pattern that had to be viewed from a European perspective, she told reporters on Wednesday. \"The war in Ukraine is very serious. When I look at Europe today I think we are in the most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the Second World War - not the Cold War any more.\"\n\nEPA/Shutterstock A German frigate has also arrived in the Danish capital to bolster air defences\n\nSweden has loaned \"powerful radar systems\" to its neighbour for the week and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv is sending a mission to Denmark for joint exercises to provide \"Ukrainian experience in drone defence\". German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said ahead of the summit that air space incursions were getting worse and worse and it was \"reasonable to assume the drones are coming from Russia\". Drones have been seen in recent days over Germany's northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, and flights have been delayed in the past week at Vilnius airport in Lithuania and at Oslo airport in Norway because of drone activity. \"We are not at war, but we are no longer at peace either. We must do much more for our own security,\" Merz told a media event in Düsseldorf this week.\n\nEPA/Shutterstock European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen raised the idea of a \"drone wall\" last month\n\nRead more: Drone attacks leave Denmark exposed and searching for response\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was obvious Germany had long been \"indirectly involved\" in the war in Ukraine and he rejected \"unfounded accusations\" of Russian involvement in last week's disruption in Denmark. \"Europe would be better off seeking dialogue on security issues rather than looking to build a divisive \"drone wall\", he said on Tuesday. Such is the concern at Russian activity on Europe's eastern flank that Nato met for consultations twice in September under Article 4 of its treaty, first after drones violated Polish airspace and then when Russian MiG-31 war planes entered Estonian air space for 12 minutes. \"We have to keep our skies safe,\" said Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels on the eve of the Copenhagen summit. The idea of a drone wall was raised a month ago by von der Leyen, and Rutte said it was \"timely and necessary because in the end we cannot spend millions of euros or dollars on missiles to take out drones which are only costing a couple of thousand dollars\". A senior EU diplomat told the BBC there were still questions over financing the plan and over command and control, but Europe's response to Russia's drone violations in Poland had led to some serious soul-searching: \"We have to be more agile and find better tools.\"",

The province of Cebu, which suffered the brunt of the damage, declared a state of calamity early on Wednesday, after thousands spent the night on the streets amid repeated aftershocks. One Cebu resident told the BBC he was among them, adding that power and water supplies were cut off. He says the voices of crying children could be heard around him, adding that they were \"traumatised\". The earthquake comes barely more than a week after the country was hit by back-to-back typhoons which killed more than 20 people.\n\nAnadolu via Getty Images Residents of Bogo City, Cebu province, stay on the streets near the debris of damaged buildings amid frequent aftershocks, following a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. Photo: 1 October 2025\n\nMost of the earthquake victims were from Bogo, a small town on one of the largest islands in the Visayas Islands, the Philippines' central region - and the place closest to the earthquake's epicentre. Images coming out of Bogo show body bags lined on the street and hundreds of people being treated in tent hospitals. Officials have warned of \"a lot of damage\" caused by the earthquakes. The local authorities have appealed for volunteers with medical experience to help deal with injuries. Buckled and cracked roads, and fallen bridges are also making access difficult for emergency services. Power lines in many places are down, meaning that it's also been hard to speak to those affected. Seven of those who died in Tuesday's earthquake in Bogo had lived in a village built to house victims of Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the central Philippines 12 years ago, killing more than 6,000 people. In the municipality of San Remigio, a basketball game was being played when the earthquake struck, an emergency response official told the BBC. Almost 20 people at the game were sent to the hospital, and at least one person later died. Officials from the national police and fire bureau say they are prioritising search and rescue operations, rushing to restore electricity and delivering relief supplies to those affected. On Wednesday evening, Bogo was hit by yet another aftershock, this one at a magnitude of 4.7, with tremors felt in Cebu city and the neighbouring Leyte islands. There were no known casualties. Cebu's archbishop has told devotees to stay away from churches, pending structural assessments. This call is significant as Cebu was one of the first Philippine islands to be colonised by Spain in the 1500s, and has many old churches. Earlier footage showed the tower of an old Catholic church swaying and then partly collapsing in one locality.\n\nMoment bell tower falls from church during earthquake",

      "content": "Kenya offers reward as anger grows over failure to arrest suspected serial killer\n\nIt caused outrage, and police are facing a renewed backlash over their failure to hunt down Khalusha more than a year later.\n\nShortly after his arrest, he escaped from custody, along with 12 others, after reportedly cutting through a wire mesh roof and scaling a perimeter wall.\n\nKhalusha was the prime suspect in the murder of more than 40 women whose mutilated bodies were discovered in a disused quarry that became a dumpsite in the capital, Nairobi.\n\nKenyan police have offered a reward of 1 million shillings ($7,700; £5,700) for information leading to the arrest of suspected serial killer Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, more than a year after he escaped from their custody.\n\nMany Kenyans have questioned how he could have escaped on 20 August 2024 from what is regarded as one of the most secure police stations, located near the US embassy and the UN offices in the capital.\n\nKhalid Hussein, an activist who has been following the case closely, told the BBC that the police were \"not serious\" about solving the murders of the women they previously identified as being aged between 18 and 30.\n\nHe alleged that some bodies were still inside the quarry pits, and \"rotting\".\n\nMr Hussein believes the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) announced the reward in response to a documentary by the local Citizen TV station about the police's inaction.\n\n\"So as usual they feel embarrassed, they think they should do something and they react and they say 1 million shillings reward. Absolutely useless,\" the activist said.\n\nContacted by the BBC, police spokesman Michael Muchiri referred queries to the DCI, but added that it had previously addressed \"the complexities of that matter\", and was \"on track to resolving it.\"\n\nThe DCI said in a post on X that the 1 million shillings reward would be given to \"anyone who provides credible information that will assist in the re-arrest of the suspect\".\n\nPolice also offered a reward last year, but did not specify the amount.\n\nSeveral policemen were arrested last year for allegedly aiding Khalusha's escape, but they were later released on bail.\n\nMany Kenyans questioned how officers had failed to detect that bodies were being left in a quarry around 100m (109 yards) from a police station.\n\nKhalusha had reportedly confessed to his crimes but his lawyer later told a court that he had been tortured.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC at the time, the lawyer, John Maina Ndegwa, said the suspect had been \"strangled to confess. You could tell he was in distress, terrified and in anguish.\"\n\nAt the time of Khalusha's arrest, DCI chief Mohamed Amin said: \"It is crystallising that we are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life, who has no respect and dignity.\"\n\nHe had been set to face murder charges in court, just before his disappearance.\n\nLast month, Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen described the escape as being \"regrettable\" and a \"sad story\".\n\n\"I'm really hoping that he can be arrested,\" he said.",

Thank you, Chunk, for being an inspiration,\" she said.\n\nChunk broke his jaw in June and observers suspect the injury was the result of a fight with another bear due to the timing of it - during mating season - and the nature of it, according to Chunk's profile on the Fat Bear Week website.\n\nAdult male bears average up to 408kg in mid-summer and often pack on the equivalent of 25% of their bodyweight by autumn. The largest males often tip the scales at more than 540kg.\n\nChunk beat one of the biggest bears along the river, known as 856, by more than 30,000 votes.\n\nExplore.org's Mike Fitz, a former ranger, said Chunk and 856 were \"real-life rivals on the river\".\n\nThe contest is Fitz's brainchild.

      "content": "South African firebrand MP Malema convicted of firing a gun in public\n\nMalema was convicted of hate speech less than two months ago and often lashes out at the white minority in a country where, 31 years after apartheid ended, racial tensions still run high.\n\nHe was charged alongside his former bodyguard Adriaan Snyman, who was acquitted.\n\nIn 2018, a video emerged showing the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader using a semi-automatic rifle to fire several shots in the air during his party's fifth anniversary celebrations held in the country's Eastern Cape province.\n\nSouth African opposition politician Julius Malema has been found guilty of illegal possession of a gun and firing it in public, offences which carry a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nHe has called for the seizure of white-owned land and argues that more should be done to transfer wealth to the black majority.\n\nMalema was convicted of five offences, including the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, discharging it in a public space and reckless endangerment. These offences fall under the Firearms Control Act and carry a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nHe was accused of firing between 14 and 15 live rounds on a stage in front of 20,000 EFF supporters, according to South African news site SowetanLIVE.\n\nIn his defence, Malema told the court the firearm was not his and that he had fired the shots to rouse the crowd, the publication added.\n\nIt took three days for magistrate Twanet Olivier to tell Malema \"you are found guilty as charged\". The case was postponed to January 2026 for pre-sentencing.\n\nMalema seemed unfazed by his conviction, telling supporters that \"going to prison or death is a badge of honour\".\n\n\"We cannot be scared of prison [or] to die for the revolution. Whatever they want to do, they must know we will never retreat,\" he said outside the East London regional court.\n\nHe vowed to challenge the judgment, even up to South Africa's highest court, the Constitutional Court.\n\nMalema's prosecution came after Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum, which has a contentious relationship with Malema and the EFF, opened a case against him after the video went viral.\n\nAfriForum was also among those who laid a hate speech complaint against the EFF MP at South Africa's Human Rights Commission.\n\nThis resulted in his conviction by the country's equality court in August this year.\n\nAfter an incident where a white man allegedly assaulted an EFF member, Malema said: \"No white man is going to beat me up... you must never be scared to kill. A revolution demands that at some point there must be killing.\"\n\nThe equality court ruled that these remarks \"demonstrated an intent to incite harm\", but the EFF said they were taken out of context.\n\nMalema's controversy extends beyond South Africa.\n\nUS President Donald Trump showed a video of the radical leader during his heated meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the White House in May, using it as part of his \"evidence\" that genocide was being committed against white Afrikaners in South Africa - a claim that has been widely discredited.\n\nWhite House staff played several clips of Malema chanting \"Kill the Boer [Afrikaner], Kill the farmer\" and making fiery comments about land occupation and white people.\n\nA month later, Malema was denied entry to the UK over his support for Hamas and comments about white people in South Africa. The Home Office said he had been deemed \"non-conducive to the public good\".\n\nIan Cameron, from the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second biggest party, welcomed the conviction, saying the matter was not just about Malema's conduct but also the \"culture of chaos, violence and criminality that the leader of the EFF embodies and promotes\".\n\n\"A man who fires live rounds at a political rally demonstrates exactly the kind of thuggery the EFF is prepared to unleash on South Africa,\" Cameron, who is also an MP, said in a statement.\n\nLegal expert Ulrich Roux told the BBC there was a \"good chance\" Malema could serve a prison sentence.\n\n\"He now needs to present evidence to the court to show why... he should not receive the minimum sentence of 15 years,\" he said.\n\nIn South Africa, anyone who has been handed a prison sentence longer than 12 months without the option of a fine cannot serve as an MP. The constitution however, only regards the sentence as final once the appeal process has been exhausted. This disqualification ends five years after the sentence has been completed.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mayeni Jones",

      "content": "Israel 'tightens siege' of Gaza City as Hamas reviews Trump peace plan\n\n44 minutes ago Share Save David Gritten Share Save\n\nReuters A school shelter for displaced people in southern Gaza City was struck by Israeli forces overnight\n\nIsrael's defence minister has said its forces are \"tightening the siege\" around Gaza City by extending a military corridor across the territory towards the coast. Israel Katz also issued a final warning to the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the city to evacuate southwards, saying those who remained during the offensive against Hamas would be \"terrorists and supporters of terror\". Hospitals reported that 45 people had been killed by Israeli fire in Gaza City on Wednesday, while the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had been forced to suspend operations there. Israel is stepping up the assault as Hamas weighs its response to a new US plan to end the war.\n\nArab and Turkish mediators are understood to be pressing for a positive response, but a senior Hamas figure has said the armed group is likely to reject it.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has described Gaza City as Hamas's \"last stronghold\". It has said the offensive aims to secure the release of the 48 hostages still held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to be alive - and ensure the group's \"decisive defeat\". Israel's defence minister told Israeli media on Wednesday that the IDF was \"currently completing the capture of the Netzarim corridor to the western coast of Gaza\" - a reference to the Israeli military zone that runs east-west from the perimeter with Israel. \"This will tighten the siege around Gaza City, and anyone leaving it south will be forced to pass through the IDF's checkpoints,\" the Haaretz newspaper quoted Katz as saying. He warned that this was the \"last chance for Gaza [City] residents who are interested in moving south and leaving Hamas terrorists isolated in Gaza City itself in the face of IDF activity that continues at full strength\". \"Those who remain in Gaza will be terrorists and terror supporters,\" he warned. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that \"under international humanitarian law, civilians must be protected whether they stay or leave Gaza City\". It also said that Israel, as the occupying power, had an obligation to ensure their basic needs were met, including by protecting medical personnel and allowing the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance throughout the Strip. The ICRC's warning came in a statement announcing that the intensification of military operations had forced it to suspend operations at its office in Gaza City, where it said civilians were \"being killed, forcibly displaced and made to endure dire conditions\". \"The ICRC will continue to strive to provide support to civilians in Gaza City, whenever circumstances allow, from our offices in Deir al-Balah and Rafah [in central and southern Gaza], which remain fully operational,\" it said. \"This includes providing medical donations to the few remaining health facilities in Gaza City and doing the utmost to facilitate the movements of first responders.\"\n\nReuters Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Gaza City since August, but hundreds of thousands more are believed to remain there\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the IDF's Arabic spokesman announced that people in the south of Gaza would no longer be able to use the al-Rashid coastal road to travel north to Gaza City. The road would remain open for those fleeing south, he said. Gaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office condemned the decision, which it said was \"part of the ongoing policy of suffocation, siege, and genocide perpetrated by the occupation [Israel] against our Palestinian people in the Strip\". The IDF has ordered Gaza City residents to evacuate to a designated \"humanitarian area\" in the southern al-Mawasi area. Israeli media cited the IDF as saying on Monday that about 800,000 people had fled the city since the plans for the offensive were announced in August, and that between 250,000 and 350,000 people remained. However, the UN and its humanitarian partners said they had only monitored 397,000 people crossing into southern Gaza as of Saturday. Unicef spokesman James Elder told the BBC that during a recent visit to Gaza City he had witnessed \"multiple air strikes in the very short time\" and \"a mix of children who are emaciated [and] utterly exhausted women\". \"Anyone who could speak English would explain to me that staying in Gaza City is not a choice, that they don't have the funds to go south. They don't have the transport. Once they get south, they know there's no land, and certainly that they don't have a tent,\" he said. They also knew that conditions in al-Mawasi were overcrowded and unsanitary, and that it was not spared from Israeli strikes, he added. \"They've seen what shrapnel does to a tent. They've seen tents engulfed by flames. So they're well aware that safety, be it from the skies or disease from the ground, certainly doesn't exist.\"\n\nReuters The Civil Defence said one of its rescuers was killed while responding to the strike on the Gaza City school\n\nMedics said 29 of those killed in Gaza City on Wednesday were brought to al-Ahli hospital, in the southern Zeitoun neighbourhood. A video filmed overnight appeared to show four severely injured men wearing high-visibility jackets receiving treatment inside a tent there. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency alleged that a team of its paramedics and firefighters were \"directly targeted\" by an Israeli strike as they responded to a strike on nearby al-Falah school, which was being used as a shelter for displaced families. It said the rescuers had been performing humanitarian work, wearing uniforms, and driving marked vehicles, and that the attack constituted a flagrant violation of international law. The agency initially said seven rescuers were injured and two were in a critical condition. Later, it announced that one of them, Munther al-Dahshan, had died. Palestinian media reported that six people were killed in the initial strike on the school. One Civil Defence member said on social media that the casualties included children, and posted a video of a severely injured boy lying on a hospital bed frame. When asked to comment, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it \"struck a Hamas terrorist\" and that \"steps were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians\".\n\nBBC Verify analyses President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza and what it means on the ground",

      "title": "How the government shutdown will affect Americans",
      "description": "Washington's political gridlock could inflict wide-ranging miseries, as anything deemed non-essential will be put on hold.",
      "content": "Jobs, travel, national parks - what impact will US shutdown have?\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Max Matza Share Save\n\nWatch: What could happen during the US government shutdown?\n\nThe US federal government has shut down after Republican and Democratic lawmakers failed to resolve a budget stand-off. The impasse affects the funding of government operations throughout October and beyond, and is poised to cause widespread disruption for Americans in areas ranging from air travel to zoo visits. The political gridlock is also expected to put 40% of the federal workforce – about 750,000 people – on unpaid leave. This is how its impact could be felt across the US.\n\nYour next flight\n\nA federal shutdown could hit flyers in a variety of ways, potentially leading to long security queues and delays caused by unpaid air traffic controllers choosing to stay home rather than work for free. Air traffic control and Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) workers are considered \"essential\", so they will continue to go to work. But they will not be paid until the shutdown ends. When this last happened in 2018-2019, these workers increasingly began to call in sick, leading to delays that had a ripple effect across the country. Americans planning to travel abroad could also be impacted, with US passport agencies warning that it could take longer than usual to process travel documents.\n\nNo work - or pay - for federal workers\n\nFederal employees are expected to be hardest hit, as they will not receive any pay cheques while the shutdown continues. Law enforcement officers will continue to work through the government shutdown - though more than 200,000 of them will do so unpaid, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X. Also continuing their work as usual are border protection staff, including ICE Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, in-hospital medical care staff and air-traffic controllers. According to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, the five government departments with the most furloughed staff are: Department of Defense (civilian staff): 334,904 furloughed, 406,573 retained\n\nDepartment of Health: 32,460 furloughed, 47,257 retained\n\nDepartment of Commerce: 34,711 furloughed, 8,273 retained\n\nDepartment of State: 16,651 furloughed, 10,344 retained\n\nNasa: 15,094 furloughed, 3,124 retained Some workers may choose to take second jobs, as they have done during previous shutdowns. Employees who are not deemed to be essential will be forced to stay at home. In the past, these workers have then been paid retroactively. Several agencies, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are likely to furlough many workers, affecting ongoing research and experiments already in progress. US President Donald Trump, who has slashed government spending and cut federal jobs since taking office, has warned repeatedly that a shutdown could accelerate further layoffs and allow him to cut services and programmes he says are important to Democrats. Contractors who work for federal agencies but are not directly employed by the government will miss out on work, too. These workers historically have not received any back-pay, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Members of Congress, however, will still be paid. They are protected under the US Constitution - a convention that has been opposed by some lawmakers.\n\nNational Parks with no staff\n\nFederal lands, including National Parks and National Forests, have been closed off to visitors during past shutdowns, since the rangers and other employees were asked to stay at home. During the last shutdown, the Trump administration made the decision to leave parks open, with few to no federal workers there to staff them. The decision led to vandalism in parks, as visitors drove through protected landscapes, looted historical sites, and rampantly littered, according to park advocates. A group of more than 40 former park superintendents have appealed to the White House to completely close the parks in the event of a shutdown. \"We don't leave museums open without curators, or airports without air traffic controllers - and we should not leave our national parks open without National Park Service workers,\" said Emily Thompson of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks.\n\nVisit to the zoo\n\nThe famous Smithsonian Institution museums will stay open until at least Monday, 6 October. On the Smithsonian website, the organisation said it had money available from years prior to help it keep operating. Animals at the National Zoo \"will continue to be fed and cared for\", according to the Smithsonian, which runs the zoo. But the popular webcams will be shut off, as they have been deemed non-essential by zoo staff, so viewers won't be able to peek at the pandas, lions, elephants and naked mole rats.\n\nHealthcare for the elderly and poor\n\nMedicare and Medicaid, social health programmes for the elderly and poor, will continue, but staffing shortages could lead to some interruptions. Food assistance programmes will also be impacted, with the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) expected to rapidly run out of funds. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) is expected to continue for longer, but is at risk of running out of funding. Emergency disaster relief will also be largely unaffected, however other work done by disaster agencies will be impacted. The National Flood Insurance Program will be closed, delaying some mortgages on properties that require policies from the government-run programme. But if the shutdown drags out, it is possible that the Federal Emergency Management Administration (Fema) could run out of money for its Disaster Relief Fund.\n\nMail will still arrive\n\nThe US Postal Service has previously been unaffected by government shutdowns - and this time is no different. In a statement posted on its website earlier this week, the service said all post offices would remain open for business as usual. This is because the postal service does not depend on Congress for funding. It is an independent entity that is generally funded through the sale of its products and services, not by tax dollars.",

      "content": "Emily Blunt among Hollywood stars outraged over 'AI actor' Tilly Norwood\n\n14 hours ago Share Save Regan Morris Los Angeles Share Save\n\nGetty Images Oscar-nominated actress Emily Blunt called the AI creation terrifying\n\nAn \"AI actor\" named Tilly Norwood has been causing a stir after its Dutch creators said the synthetic performer is in talks with talent agencies. Norwood could be mistaken for a young, aspiring actress when one glances at its social media. The brunette poses for photos and showcases a fully AI-generated comedy sketch, where it is described as having \"girl next door vibes.\" \"I may be AI, but I'm feeling very real emotions right now,\" Tilly's creators wrote on her page. \"I am so excited for what's coming next!\" Hollywood is not rolling out the red carpet. Its powerful actors union has condemned the creation, along with A-list stars like Emily Blunt, Natasha Lyonne and Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nNorwood \"is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers,\" the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA, said in a statement. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience,\" the union said. The AI actor was created by Dutch actor and comedian Eline Van der Velden who reportedly said she wanted Norwood to become the \"next Scarlett Johansson\". The BBC has reached out to Van der Velden and her company, Particle6. Norwood's Instagram page includes headshots from faux filming tests and an advertisement spoofing programs on the BBC, including being superimposed on the often-star-studded couch on BBC's The Graham Norton Show. Amid the anger and backlash in Hollywood, the Dutch creator posted on Tilly's Instagram page to say that the creation is \"not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work – a piece of art\". \"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" Van der Velden wrote, adding such creations should be judged \"as part of their own genre\" rather than compared to human actors.\n\nReuters The use of AI was a key sticking point that led to the lengthy 2023 Hollywood strikes\n\nAI has been a hotly contested technology in Hollywood and was a key sticking point during labour strikes that shut down the industry two years ago as writers and actors demanded protections from the technology. In its statement on Norwood, SAG-AFTRA reminded agencies and studios that using Norwood in projects could pose issues for contractual protections they secured after the 2023 strike. \"It doesn't solve any 'problem' — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry,\" the union said. Actress and filmmaker Natasha Lyonne, known for her leading roles in Poker Face, Orange Is the New Black and Russian Doll, said anyone who works with Norwood should be boycotted. \"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" said Lyonne, who is currently working with \"ethical AI\" to create a feature film that stars real actors. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed.\" Fellow actress Emily Blunt, speaking on a podcast with Variety, said the creation was terrifying.",

      "content": "A military court in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has sentenced the country’s former president Joseph Kabila to death in absentia after convicting him of war crimes, treason and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe case stems from his alleged role in backing the advance of M23 rebels supported by Rwanda in DRC’s volatile eastern provinces. Kabila, who led the country from 2001 to 2019, has denied wrongdoing and said the judiciary had been politicised.\n\nLt Gen Joseph Mutombo Katalayi, presiding over the tribunal in Kinshasa, said Kabila had been found guilty of charges that included murder, sexual assault, torture and insurrection.\n\nKabila did not attend the trial and was not represented by legal counsel. Neither he nor his representatives were immediately available for comment. His whereabouts were not immediately known.\n\n“In applying article 7 of the military penal code,[the court] imposes a single sentence, namely the most severe one, which is the death penalty,” Katalayi said while delivering the verdict.\n\nKabila was also ordered to pay about $50bn (£36bn) in damages to the state and victims.\n\nThe verdict could fuel further divisions in the vast mineral-rich central African country, which has endured decades of conflict.\n\nKabila spent almost 20 years in power and stepped down only after deadly protests against him. He has been living mostly in South Africa since 2023, but appeared in the rebel-held city of Goma in eastern DRC in May.\n\nHe entered in to an awkward power-sharing deal with his successor, Felix Tshisekedi, but their relationship soon soured.\n\nAs M23 rebels marched on eastern DRC’s second-largest city of Bukavu in February, Tshisekedi told the Munich security conference that Kabila had sponsored the insurgency.\n\nM23 now controls much of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. The fighting has killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more this year. The two sides signed a US-brokered peace agreement in June, but they are both reinforcing their positions and blaming one another for flouting the accord, sources have said.\n\nRwanda, which has long denied helping M23, says its forces act in self-defence against DRC’s army and ethnic Hutu militia members linked to the 1994 genocide.\n\nTshisekedi’s government has moved to suspend Kabila’s political party and seize its leaders’ assets.",

I heard the call, I felt the suffering, I understood the impact on daily life,” he said.\n\nApplications for a new premier will be received over the next three days before a new government is formed, he said.\n\nThe president said he wanted to create space for dialogue with young people, and promised measures to support businesses affected by looting.\n\nThousands of people, many dressed in black and chanting for Rajoelina to resign, have marched in the capital Antananarivo since the demonstrations began last week.\n\nView image in fullscreen Riot police use teargas to disperse protesters. Photograph: Zo Andrianjafy/Reuters\n\nPolice have responded with a heavy hand, firing teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. More than 100 people have been injured.\n\nThe UN’s human rights office blamed a “violent response” by security forces for some of the deaths, with other fatalities caused by violence and looting by gangs not associated with the protesters.\n\nMadagascar’s ministry of foreign affairs rejected the casualty figures reported by the UN, saying the data did not come from competent national authorities, saying they were “based on rumours or misinformation”.\n\nOn Monday, protesters gathered at a university where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march towards the city centre, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed.\n\nPolice fired teargas to disperse the crowd after authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew last week.\n\nThe protesters have adapted a flag used in Nepal where protesters forced the prime minister to resign earlier this month, and they have also used similar online organisation tactics as protests in Kenya last year that culminated in the government scrapping proposed tax legislation.\n\nRajoelina first came to power in a 2009 coup. He stepped down in 2014 but became president again after winning the 2018 election, and secured a third term in a December 2023 poll that his challengers said was marred by irregularities.\n\nMadagascar is among the world’s poorest nations and has experienced frequent popular uprisings since gaining independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced former president Marc Ravalomanana from power.",

      "content": "A historic EU-style free movement agreement comes into force in four Caribbean countries on Wednesday, in a deal which officials hope will stem the flow of skilled professionals leaving the region for North America and Europe.\n\nThe agreement between Barbados, Belize, Dominica and St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) follows decades of discussions and negotiations among members of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) – a regional grouping of 15 member countries.\n\nThe “full free movement” will allow nationals of the four countries to reside, work and remain indefinitely in any of the countries without the need for a work or residency permit.\n\nIt is an expansion of migration options currently offered under the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) programme, in which Caricom nationals can apply to reside in any participating member countries under categories such as skills, services and business establishment.\n\nDavid Comissiong, the Barbados ambassador to Caricom, said the scheme was not just about free movement of workers, but was also about cultural and economic integration and achieving a single market and single economy across the Caribbean.\n\n“We are virtually the same people. We have no historical animosities against each other, and we are very similar culturally. So, this is a breakthrough, even though it’s only four countries. The idea is, once the four countries make the start and perfect this regime, that others will join,” he said.\n\nKendol Morgan, a former Caricom communications lead, said one concern for some nations during negotiations was the potential pressure on social services.\n\n“I know that some countries were concerned that if there was a lot of movement that a lot of people came in, say for employment, and they brought their children with them and spouses, the numbers may add up. And where the health sector is already stretched just catering for the local population, that may extend to a point where the authorities may find it difficult to deal with,” he said.\n\nA similar free movement arrangement between countries in a sub regional group called the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States gave some confidence to governments, after “they saw that there was no overrunning of any particular country”, he said.\n\nThe new arrangement comes amid ongoing concerns about a regional brain drain, with skilled professionals following lucrative salaries and opportunities in the UK, the US and Canada, leaving islands with gaps in critical fields such as healthcare and education.\n\nMia Mottley, the Barbados prime minister, has raised concerns about the country’s declining and ageing population.\n\nEchoing her concerns, Comissiong, said he hopes the full freedom of movement scheme will provide more opportunities in the region.\n\n“All of our countries have a vested interest in cutting down on the number of our people who migrate to North America and Europe, especially since the majority of these migrants, tend to be… highly educated and trained young people – precisely the citizens that we need to keep at home so that they could produce and contribute to national development.\n\n“Anything that we could do to make our Caribbean region more attractive to these young people who live at home is a step in the right direction,” he said.\n\nOpinions across the region were split. Anthony Roberts, 45, a shop attendant in Barbados expressed concern the deal would mean more competition for jobs. But University of the West Indies student, Darren Clarke, 21, said it was “a step in the right direction”.\n\n“People should be able to move around and contribute wherever their skills are needed. I like the idea that I could one day take a job in Jamaica or Guyana without having to jump through a million hoops,” he said.\n\nMichelle Thorne, 46, an air traffic controller in St Vincent and the Grenadines is concerned that Vincentians would be enticed by higher salaries and the country would lose critical workforce.\n\nBut teacher Marissa Bacchus, 32, said the arrangement provides an alternative to migrating to the US, which she says is becoming less attractive because of gun violence. “I am already considering moving … . I’m qualified to teach in Barbados. I feel much safer in the Caribbean and don’t have to worry about winter and I’m on a quick flight home if anything,” she said.",

      "content": "Police in Spain have arrested three men thought to have piloted a “narco-submarine” carrying more than 3.6 tonnes of cocaine from South America to the north-western region of Galicia, after the trio’s wet clothes and claims to be pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago raised suspicions.\n\nThe investigation, which has led to a total of 14 arrests, began in August after Policía Nacional officers, working with the US Drug Enforcement Agency, detected an alleged drug-smuggling gang based in the Galician town of Outes that was said to be concealing its activities by posing as a company selling and repairing nautical equipment.\n\nOn 13 September, the gang’s high-powered boats were spotted heading out of the nearby port of O Freixo, prompting police to scramble teams to intercept the boats when they came back, allegedly loaded with drugs brought to the coast in the semi-submersible.\n\nAs soon as the boats returned and the gang began loading bales of cocaine into two trailers, officers pounced, they said. A tonne of the drug was recovered after one of the trailers overturned during a high-speed chase, and the remainder of the seizure was discovered the following day, hidden under a tarpaulin on a nearby beach, police said.\n\nThe alleged crew of the sub – a Colombian man and two Ecuadorians – were later arrested “after trying to evade officers by fleeing in a taxi in wet clothes, pretending to be pilgrims”, according to a police statement. Their soaking and suspicious appearance caught the attention of the taxi driver and they were arrested by local police, who found a wetsuit in one of their rucksacks.\n\nThe sub itself is thought to have wrecked or been scuttled a few miles off the coast of Galicia.\n\nAs well as seizing 3.65 tonnes of cocaine and arresting the 14 people on suspicion of drug-trafficking and belonging to a criminal organisation, the Policía Nacional has confiscated €54,680 (£47,700), two boats, five cars and a trailer.\n\nAntonio Martínez Duarte, the head of the Policía Nacional’s drug and organised crime unit, said it was rare for officers to be able to intercept cocaine shipments when they first reached land.\n\n“After hours of sacrifice and silent work, we’ve been able to arrest the crew and seize the drugs on land, something that isn’t that common in Galicia,” he told La Voz de Galicia.\n\n“The problem in Galicia is getting into these places which they know and which we don’t, and where they can drive in the dark and we can’t. But this time we were there, watching how they carried out an operation. And we managed to get them when they took off.”\n\nAlthough narco-subs had been used regularly in Colombia and other parts of South and Central America for more than 30 years, they remained a novelty in European waters until 2019, when the first such vessel, laden with three tonnes of cocaine, was found scuttled in a Galician cove.\n\nSpanish police say the number of “narco-sub” alerts has surged over the summer, from one every three months to more than five a month.",

      "content": "Australia sunscreen scandal grows as more products pulled off shelves\n\nAn investigation by the medicines regulator has now warned about 20 more sunscreens from other brands, which share the same base formula, and raised \"significant concerns\" about a testing laboratory.\n\nOne product, Ultra Violette's Lean Screen Skinscreen, is supposed to offer a skin protection factor (SPF) of 50+ but instead returned a result of SPF 4 and was voluntarily recalled in August.\n\nAnalysis by a consumer advocacy group in June found several popular and expensive sunscreens did not provide the protection claimed by their makers.\n\nA sunscreen scandal in Australia is continuing to grow, with 18 products now pulled from shelves in the skin cancer hotspot over safety concerns.\n\n\"The preliminary testing indicates that this base formulation is unlikely to have an SPF greater than 21,\" the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said in an update, adding that for some of the goods the SPF rating may be as low as four.\n\nOf the 21 products it named, eight have been recalled or manufacture stopped completely. The sale of another 10 products have been paused, and two more are being reviewed. One product named by the TGA is made in Australia but is not sold in the country.\n\nAustralia has the highest rate of skin cancers in the world - it is estimated that two out of three Australians will have at least one cut out in their lifetime - and it has some of the strictest sunscreen regulations globally.\n\nThe scandal has caused a massive backlash from customers in the nation, but experts have warned it may also have global implications. Problems have been identified with both the manufacture of some sunscreens and the integrity of lab testing relied upon to prove their SPF claims.\n\nThe manufacturer of the base formula in question, Wild Child Laboratories Pty Ltd, has stopped making it as a result, the TGA said.\n\nIn a statement, Wild Child Laboratories boss Tom Curnow said the TGA had found no manufacturing issues at its facility.\n\n\"The discrepancies reported in recent testing are part of a broader, industry-wide issue,\" he said.\n\nThe TGA has previously said it is looking into \"reviewing existing SPF testing requirements\" which can be \"highly subjective\", but in the update on Tuesday said it had significant concerns about testing undertaken by Princeton Consumer Research Corp (PCR Corp), a US lab.\n\n\"The TGA is aware that many companies responsible for sunscreens manufactured using this base formulation relied on testing by PCR Corp to support their SPF claims.\"\n\nMr Curnow said Wild Child had ceased working with PCR laboratories and had submitted its formulas for testing with other accredited, independent laboratories.\n\nAll companies using the problematic base formula and the PCR lab have also been contacted by the TGA, it said.\n\n\"The TGA has also written to PCR Corp regarding its concerns and has not received a response.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement to the BBC, PCR Corp suggested that external factors could account for SPF rating discrepancies between their tests and those later conducted by others.\n\n\"Sunscreen performance measured in a laboratory reflects the exact batch and condition of the sample submitted at that moment,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Multiple factors outside the laboratory - such as manufacturing variability between batches, raw-material differences, packaging, storage conditions, product age, and in-market handling - can influence the SPF of products sold later.\"\n\nThe statement went on to explain that \"testing is therefore one part of a broader quality and regulatory process that includes manufacturing controls, stability programmes, and post-market surveillance by brands and regulators\".\n\n\"We can only speak to the data we generated on the samples we tested; we cannot opine on any subsequently manufactured or sold product that we did not test.\"",

      "content": "The United Nations has adopted a resolution to transform a security mission in gang-dominated Haiti into a larger, fully fledged force with military troops.\n\nThe new unit can now have a maximum of 5,500 uniformed personnel, including police officers and soldiers, unlike the current mission, which is just law enforcement. The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, said the vote by 12 security council members to “transform the multinational security support (MSS) mission to the new gang suppression force, a mission five times the size of its predecessor” showed the “international community was sharing the burden”.\n\nWashington co-sponsored the enlargement push with Panama.\n\nCurrently 1,000 officers, mostly from Kenya, are deployed in Haiti under the security mission aimed at supporting the Haitian police in their fight against rampant gang violence, but it has had mixed results.\n\n“Every day, innocent lives are snuffed out by bullets, fire and fear,” Laurent Saint-Cyr, who heads the Haitian Transitional Presidential Council, told the UN’s signature diplomatic gathering last week. “Entire neighbourhoods are disappearing, forcing more than a million people into internal exile and reducing to nothing memories, investments and infrastructure.\n\n“This is the face of Haiti today, a country at war, a contemporary Guernica, a human tragedy on America’s doorstep,” he added.\n\nView image in fullscreen Debris in a street in Port-au-Prince. Photograph: Clarens Siffroy/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSaint-Cyr had thrown his support behind the US and Panamanian proposal to evolve the mission into a more resilient force for an initial period of one year. “The council can help restore peace in a nation currently suffocated by merciless gangs,” Panama’s ambassador to the UN, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, said ahead of the vote.\n\nKenya’s president, William Ruto, said last week that “with the right personnel, adequate resources, appropriate equipment and necessary logistics, Haiti’s security can be restored”.\n\nThe boost in force will be accompanied by the creation of a support office within the UN, suggested several months ago by the secretary general, António Guterres, to provide the required logistical and financial support.\n\nThe US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, said last week: “This mandate would empower the force to proactively target gangs and restore security to Haiti while ensuring it has the appropriate tools to succeed the mission’s anticipated objectives.”\n\nChina had expressed scepticism about the role of the mission without political transition in Haiti and abstained during the vote to create it in 2023, as did Russia. Beijing and Moscow abstained again on Tuesday’s vote.\n\nRussia and China were both critical of Washington, accusing it of failing to stop an illicit flow of weapons to Haiti from the US and not providing enough funding for the initial mission. They also said the US had rushed through a resolution that was ambiguous on several critical issues, including rules of engagement.\n\n“Let us be frank, if that contributor failed to provide the promised funds for the MSS, what guarantees are there that things will be different with this new mission?” said Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, describing the money needed for Haiti as very modest compared to the billions of dollars spent by countries to send weapons to Ukraine.\n\nHe also echoed concern raised by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Saturday about how the US could interpret the gang suppression force mandate. The resolution adopted on Tuesday authorises countries taking part to take all necessary measures to carry out its mandate, meaning the use of force.\n\n“We have no certainty that the authors of today’s text will not come up with some kind of – quote, unquote – creative way to link their military activity to allegedly combating drug cartels,” Nebenzia said.\n\nThe poorest country in the Americas, Haiti has long suffered at the hands of violent criminal gangs that commit murders, rapes, looting and kidnappings against a backdrop of chronic political instability.\n\nThe situation has worsened significantly since early 2024, when gangs drove then-prime minister, Ariel Henry, to resign. The country, which has not held elections since 2016, has since been led by a transitional presidential council.",

      "content": "Wildfires that raged through one of Africa’s largest national parks have been brought under control, Namibia’s government has said, amid criticisms over the response mechanism and limited resources.\n\nThe fire broke out in Etosha national park, in the arid desert nation’s north, on 22 September. The government said it suspected charcoal production next to the park, which is home to 114 mammal species including the critically endangered black rhino, was to blame.\n\nOn Saturday, the government said 49 soldiers were being deployed to fight the fires and a further 500 on Sunday. It said more than 775,000 hectares inside the park, about a third of its area, had been burned and another 171,000 outside it.\n\n“All fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues,” the prime minister, Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare, posted on his Facebook page on Monday morning, listing 10 separate blazes in the region.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elephants drink at a waterhole in Etosha national park in Namibia on 23 September.

He said: “Fires in the park are pretty much contained, but not extinguished and the others running from the park are still out of control. However there is not much in the park left to burn.”\n\nHe criticised the government for not coordinating with citizens and private organisations sooner. “Why did they take so long to accept our help? [It took them] five days… [and] only on the fourth day was the army deployed.”\n\nFrank Stein, who runs Bay Air Aviation, a medical air ambulance company, flew reconnaissance flights at the weekend to help farmers battling to stop the fires spreading further south of the national park on to their land. He said: “I read in the news that the Namibian Defence Force is fighting the fires and this might very well be, but I didn’t see them on the ground.\n\n“All I saw was a handful of farmers, maybe 50 people in total, different groups, trying to fight the fires with, I wouldn’t even call it limited resources.”\n\nView image in fullscreen The fire in the Etosha national park has killed nine antelopes and spread further into communal land in the Oshana and Omusati regions, according to the environment, forestry and tourism ministry.

Photograph: Namstrong/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStein said the government was now asking his company and others to submit proposals to help them fight the fires, adding: “All of a sudden there’s an emergency and … then everybody’s happy to pay, but by that time it’s too late. The economy of scale option has passed you.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Namibia’s prime minister posted on Facebook: “We appreciate those in the private sector that are assisting in curtailing the fire … Let’s work together: government and private sector. Let’s discourage those engaging in helpless blame game [sic]. Government has deployed resources to ensure the fire is contained.”\n\nThe government said that an elephant death had been reported but not confirmed, nine antelopes had been killed by the fire and one pangolin rescued.\n\nThe park’s main attraction for tourists is the ancient Etosha salt pan. It is 80 miles long and 30 wide and draws huge flocks of flamingoes during the rainy season, which usually starts in October or November.",

Princess Anne left a toy bear at a memorial for children killed since Russia's full-scale invasion, and spoke to young people alleged to have been taken from their homes by Russian forces. She also discussed the UK's support for Ukraine and its ongoing resistance with President Volodomyr Zelensky. The official visit, taken at the request of the Foreign Office, comes just weeks after her nephew Prince Harry visited war-wounded veterans during a surprise visit to Kyiv.\n\nAnne, who is the King's sister, paid her respects at the Children's Memorial alongside First Lady Olena Zelenska, who opened the site in the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The princess also visited the Child Rights Protection Centre, set up during the conflict to support young people affected by the war, where she spoke to children who had been reunited with their families and staff \"working tirelessly\" to bring more young people back.\n\nKyiv estimates that at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been deported and forcibly displaced from their homes to Russia and Russian-occupied territories since February 2022. Just 1,605 have come home so far, according to the government's Children of War database. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Rusian President Vladimir Putin and his Children's Rights Commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, in 2023 for the alleged unlawful deportation of children. Russia denies the accusation and says it has protected children by moving them from a war zone for their safety. Anne's visit comes weeks after the UK announced new sanctions targeting those supporting the alleged attempts \"to forcibly deport and indoctrinate\" Ukrainian children.",

      "content": "West Africans deported by the US to Ghana are now fending for themselves in Togo after being dumped in the country without documents, according to lawyers and deportees.\n\nThe latest chapter in Donald Trump’s deportation programme, their saga became public earlier this month when the Ghanaian president, John Mahama, disclosed that his country had struck a deal to accept deportees from the region.\n\nEight to 10 west African nationals have since been forcibly sent by Ghana to Togo, bypassing a formal border crossing, and then left on the street without passports.\n\n“The situation is terrible,” said Benjamin, a Nigerian national, who said over the weekend he was staying in a hotel room with three other deportees and only one bed, living on money sent from their families in the US.\n\nBenjamin – who is using a pseudonym to protect his identity, as he fears persecution from the Nigerian government – said an immigration judge had ruled in June that he couldn’t be deported to Nigeria, citing risks to his life because of his past involvement in politics. He had expected to be released to his wife and children, who are US citizens.\n\nHe said he was beaten by immigration and customs enforcement (Ice) agents when he refused to board a US military plane headed to an unspecified location, which turned out to be Ghana.\n\nIce did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nView image in fullscreen John Mahama, the president of Ghana, has said his country is ready to accept more west African nationals deported by the US.\n\nUp to 28 people have arrived in the west African nation from the US so far in the deportation programme.\n\nAccra disclosed an initial batch of 14, and Meredyth Yoon, a US-based lawyer, said a second plane that could carry the same amount had since landed, though it was unclear how many people were on it.\n\nThe initial 14 deportees had won protections in US immigration courts preventing their removal to their home countries for fear of persecution, their lawyers said.\n\nBut Washington was sending them to Ghana as a loophole, Yoon said – with Accra making it clear people would be forwarded on to their home countries.\n\nOne deportee, a bisexual man from the Gambia, was immediately sent home by Ghanaian authorities and is living in hiding because same-sex relations are criminalised in the socially conservative country, according to court filings.\n\nTwo Togolese nationals were deported to the Togo border with Benjamin. They were crying and repeating “It’s over, it’s over”, he said, adding that they had since gone into hiding.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, they were driven to the Aflao border crossing on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lomé. With the cooperation of Togolese border officials, they were taken “through the back door” of the facility and left on the other side.\n\n“We are in hiding right now because we have no type of documents, ID, whatsoever,” said Emmanuel, a Liberian national who arrived in the US in the 1990s during the first Liberian civil war and was granted asylum.\n\nEmmanuel and Benjamin had been green card holders, and are married to US citizens. Both were sent to Ice detention after serving prison sentences for separate fraud charges.\n\nEmmanuel was fighting his removal in court when he was deported, Yoon said.\n\nThe UN human rights office has called on Ghana to stop deporting those sent by the US “to Nigeria, the Gambia, Togo, Mali, Liberia or any other third country where there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture”.\n\nThe US state department said: “We will pursue all appropriate options to remove aliens who should not be in the United States.”",

      "content": "Rescuers in the Philippines combed through rubble and mud after the deadliest earthquake in more than a decade killed at least 69 people, with patients overwhelming hospitals on the island of Cebu.\n\nOutside the Cebu provincial hospital, injured children cried and adults screamed on Wednesday as they were treated on beds beneath blue tents. They had been wheeled outside as a precaution against waves of aftershocks.\n\nThe shallow, magnitude-6.9 quake struck late on Tuesday in the north of Cebu, near Bogo, a city of 90,000 people, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).\n\nThe agency said that by Wednesday evening, more than 700 aftershocks had been recorded, although it added most were minor.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rescue workers conducting a search operation at a collapsed building in Bogo. Photograph: Adrian Portugal/Reuters\n\n“We can expect aftershocks in the epicentral area,” Phivolcs said. “These aftershocks could persist for several days to weeks, and some may be felt in nearby provinces.”\n\nAt the Cebu provincial hospital, workers loaded black body bags into vans that took the dead to local mortuaries.\n\n“Many of them were pinned down by debris, which caused their death,” the Office of Civil Defense deputy administrator, Rafaelito Alejandro, said on local television, putting the updated death toll at 69.\n\nView image in fullscreen A car crushed by the debris of partly collapsed buildings in Bogo. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nRichard Guion, 39, his left elbow heavily bandaged, told how he and his wife, who broke her foot, were dug from under the collapsed concrete wall of their home by their 17-year-old son, who was playing outside when the quake struck. “When the cement collapsed, I called out to him,” said Guion, thankful his son ignored his order to go to bed early.\n\nView image in fullscreen The damaged shrine of Santa Rosa de Lima in Cebu. Photograph: AP\n\nThirty people were killed in Bogo, Alejandro said. In other municipalities near the quake’s centre, 22 were killed in San Remigio, 10 in Medellin, five in Tabogon and one each in Sogod and Tabuelan, he said. The Bogo hospital put the number of injured at 186 so far.\n\nIn Bogo, firefighters used excavators to drill holes into the collapsed heap of a two-storey motel, where two receptionists and a child were feared trapped beneath debris.\n\nA distraught Isagani Jilig, whose wife and child were among the missing, joined about 100 people watching the rescue. “I will never leave this site until I find them again. As a father, I have to be strong now more than ever,” said Jilig, 41.\n\nA firefighter, Erwin Castaneda, said they had been searching for five hours but “we cannot give up”. “We are talking about lives here. We will do everything that we can,” he said.\n\nCivil defence teams were also searching for signs of life beneath a landslide that had killed at least 14 people in the city. “As much as I would want to say there’s no more fatalities, the toll could still go up,” Cebu provincial information officer Ainjeliz Orong said of the landslide.\n\nHeavy rains and power cuts have hampered rescue efforts. The Cebu provincial government has put out a call on its official Facebook page for medical volunteers to assist.\n\nThe president, Ferdinand Marcos, pledged swift aid for victims. “I offer my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” he said.\n\n1:12 Dashcam footage shows people rocked off their bikes as earthquake shakes the Philippines – video\n\nDramatic footage filmed by residents during the quake on Bantayan Island, near the island of Cebu, showed a string of lightbulbs on an old Catholic church swaying wildly before the church’s belfry tumbled into the courtyard. Local television showed riders dismounting from their motorcycles and holding on to railings as a Cebu bridge rocked violently.\n\nLocal media reported that authorities had imposed price fixing on basic goods and fuel, to keep essential products available to people affected by the quake.\n\nView image in fullscreen Motorists pass a crack in the road along a major highway in Tabogon town, Cebu province. Photograph: Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEarthquakes are a near-daily occurrence in the Philippines, which is situated on the Pacific “ring of fire”, an arc of intense seismic activity stretching from Japan through south-east Asia and across the Pacific basin. Cebu is a seismically active area.\n\nMost are too weak to be felt by humans but strong and destructive quakes come at random, with no technology available to predict when and where they might strike.",

The graphic below shows every US funding gap and government shutdown since 1976, including how long each lasted and under which administration it occurred.\n\nWhat is a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown happens when Congress does not agree on a budget, so parts of the federal government have to close until a spending plan is approved.\n\nShutdowns tend to happen in October because the government’s fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30.\n\nHow many times has the government shut down?\n\nThe current budget process was established in 1976. Since then, the government has had 20 funding gaps, resulting in 10 shutdowns.\n\nA funding gap occurs whenever Congress misses the deadline to pass a budget or a stopgap spending bill (also called a continuing resolution), leaving the government without legal authority to spend money.\n\nA single shutdown can involve multiple funding gaps if temporary funding measures expire before a long-term agreement is reached.\n\nA shutdown happens only if government operations actually stop because of that funding gap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the 1980s, funding gaps did not usually lead to shutdowns, and agencies kept operating, assuming funding would be restored soon.\n\nAfter 1980, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued legal opinions stating that, under federal law, agencies may not spend money without congressional approval. Only essential services – such as national security, air traffic control and law enforcement – could continue.\n\nSince 1982, with this new legal basis in place, funding gaps have more often resulted in full or partial government shutdowns until Congress resolves the standoff.\n\nWhen was the last government shutdown?\n\nThe last government shutdown occurred in December 2018 and January 2019 after President Donald Trump, then in his first term, and Democratic politicians hit an impasse over the president’s request for $5bn in funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, a demand the Democrats opposed.\n\nWhen was the longest shutdown?\n\nThe last shutdown was also the longest in US history, lasting 35 days from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, when Trump announced he had reached a tentative deal with congressional leaders to reopen the government for three weeks while negotiations on the border wall continued.\n\nWhat happens during a shutdown?\n\nDuring a government shutdown, nonessential federal services are halted or reduced, and many government employees are furloughed, or placed on unpaid leave.\n\nMeanwhile, essential personnel – such as military service members, law enforcement officers and air traffic controllers – are required to keep working, often without pay until funding is restored.\n\nHow are government shutdowns resolved?\n\nShutdowns are typically resolved when Congress passes a continuing resolution, which provides short-term funding while negotiations for a longer-term budget continue.\n\nSince 1990, every shutdown has ended through the passage of a continuing resolution.\n\nWhich services are halted?\n\nA shutdown primarily affects nonessential federal employees as well as people and businesses that rely on government services.\n\nThe federal government is the nation’s largest employer. As of November, it had a little more than 3 million workers – about 1.9 percent of the civilian workforce – according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data reported by the Pew Research Centre.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that if funding lapses in fiscal year 2026, about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed each day, and their lost pay would add up to about $400m daily. The exact number of furloughed workers could change over time because some agencies might increase layoffs the longer a shutdown continues while others could bring some employees back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPast shutdowns have affected numerous services and agencies, including:\n\nNational parks and monuments\n\nFederal museums\n\nFederal research projects\n\nProcessing of certain government benefits\n\nIRS taxpayer services\n\nWhich services are still in operation?\n\nEven during a shutdown, many core government functions remain in operation. Some continue because they are classified as essential for public safety and welfare while others are funded separately from the annual budget process through mandatory or self-sustaining programmes.

      "content": "Canada’s federal government has announced that a powerful and ruthless Indian gang which uses “murder, shootings and arson” to extort and intimidate diaspora communities – and has alleged links to India’s ruling government – has been designated as a terrorist entity.\n\nCanada has accused the Lawrence Bishnoi gang of possible involvement in the murder of prominent Sikh activist and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar near Vancouver.\n\nPublic safety minister Gary Anandasangaree said on Monday that the new designation would allow officials to seize any assets of the gang within the country and “gives us more powerful and effective tools to confront and put a stop to their crimes”.\n\nThe two countries were locked in a bitter diplomatic spat after Canada’s federal police agency concluded that India, with help from the Bishnoi gang, planned and ordered Nijjar’s murder. But under prime minister Mark Carney, the standoff has shown signs of easing after the countries announced plans to share intelligence in an effort to combat the rising threat of international crime and extremism.\n\nAnandasangaree said the Bishnoi gang had grown emboldened on Canadian soil, creating “a climate of insecurity in [diaspora] communities by targeting them, their prominent community members, businesses and cultural figures” through threats and violence.\n\nAnandasangaree’s decision reflects both an escalation in Canada’s fight against powerful and well-organized street gangs – and the challenges of combatting a gang whose leader governs with impunity while behind bars in an Indian jail.\n\nLawrence Bishnoi, the 32-year-old from a small village in Punjab, is now widely regarded as India’s most feared mob boss. He has been confined to a prison cell for nearly a decade, but his sprawling criminal enterprise, which started as a from a small-time racket on a university campus, has morphed into an international syndicate linked to some of the most high-profile killings both in India and abroad.\n\nThe 2022 murders of Punjabi rapper Sidhu Moose Wala and the Mumbai-based Baba Siddique, an influential 66-year-old politician, are allegedly linked to operatives of the Bishnoi gang.\n\nLast year, Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said Indian diplomats had engaged in criminal activity in Canada including the harassment and targeted killing of Canadian Sikhs linked to the Khalistan separatist movement. Police named the Bishnoi group in their allegations and said investigators believed they were “connected to the agents of the government of India”, operating as part of Narendra Modi’s strategy to pursue opponents and rivals.\n\nDelhi has long rejected the allegations as “strange” and “ludicrous”. But Canadian police say they have a growing list of examples, including the 2023 murder Nijjar in the parking lot of his gurdwara near Vancouver.\n\nThey also point to Sukhdool Singh Gill who was shot dead in Winnipeg. Gill, a member of the Bambiha gang, was wanted in India on charges of extortion, attempted murder and murder. But Indian officials also said he was also linked to the separatist Khalistan movement.\n\nA year later, police on Vancouver Island were called to the house of AP Dhillon, a prominent singer and producer who was born in Punjab and grew up in Canada. The building had been peppered with gunfire, and two vehicles were charred ruins.\n\nFootage of the attack – apparently filmed by one of the assailants – was later posted online and shared widely in India. The British Columbia public safety minister called the attack “absolutely outrageous”.\n\nRCMP commissioner Mike Duheme said police had uncovered “well over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life” leading police to issue “duty to warn” notices, including to the brother-in-law of New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh.\n\nCanadian police have arrested at least eight people, including three believed to have killed Nijjar, in connection with homicide cases and nearly two dozen people in connection with extortion investigations.\n\nUnder Canada’s criminal code, it is an offence for anyone in the country, and those abroad, to knowingly deal with property owned or controlled by a terrorist and to directly or indirectly provide property knowing that it will be used by or to benefit a terrorist group.\n\nThe designation of the Bishnoi gang was welcomed by the World Sikh Organization, which said criminal activities are at an “unprecedented high with countless businesses” facing extortion and threats.\n\n“While this designation is an important first step that equips law enforcement with stronger tools to confront this menace, it is critical that the true architects of this violence are also held to account.”",

      "content": "Parents and rescuers in Indonesia were desperately searching for dozens of teenage boys believed to be trapped, a day after the collapse of an Islamic boarding school which has already left three dead, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities said 91 people were listed as missing after the Al Khoziny school building collapsed while pupils held late afternoon prayers in a mosque housed on a lower floor of a building whose upper floors were under construction.\n\nThe boarding school is in the East Java town of Sidoarjo, about 780 km (480 miles) east of Jakarta.\n\nBy late evening on Tuesday, three bodies had been recovered, with those missing still trapped under huge slabs of concrete. Ninety-nine children and workers at the school were accounted for.\n\nThe head of the local rescue agency, Nanang Sigit, told reporters that rescuers had detected signs of life beneath the debris.\n\n1:05 Rescuers race to find survivors after school collapse in Indonesia – video\n\n“We used a camera and were able to detect six victims who showed signs of life,” he said.\n\n“When they saw the light from the search camera, they were moving their legs.”\n\nHoly Abdullah Arif, 49, wept as he held up a picture on his mobile phone of his nephew Rosi, still listed among the missing. He described his frantic search for the boy in the ruins.\n\n“I ran around screaming, ‘Rosi! Rosi! If you can hear me and can move, get out!’ And then a child was screaming back from the rubble, he was stuck. I thought that was Rosi, so I asked, ‘Are you Rosi?’ and the child said, ‘God, no, help me!’”\n\nFamilies clustered around a whiteboard with a list of the known survivors, searching for names of their children.\n\nAn excavator and a crane had been deployed to help rescuers shift the rubble, but Nanang Sigit, a local search and rescue official, said authorities would not use heavy equipment for fear of causing the remaining structure to collapse.\n\n“The rescuers are still searching for 91 people,” said Abdul Muhari, a spokesperson for the disaster mitigation agency (BNBP), adding that 26 of the injured were still being treated at local hospitals.\n\nView image in fullscreen An aerial drone photo of the collapsed school building. Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock\n\nThe building collapsed after its foundation pillars failed to support the weight of new construction on the fourth floor of the school, according to BNBP spokesperson Abdul Muhari.\n\nHe called for stricter safety standards and urged the public and building managers to oversee construction processes more carefully to prevent similar incidents.\n\nLocal media reports quoted a school official as saying construction work had been ongoing for the past nine months.\n\nLax construction standards have raised widespread concerns about building safety in Indonesia, where it is common to leave structures – particularly houses – partially completed, allowing owners to add extra floors later when their budgets permit.\n\nEarlier this month, at least three people were killed and dozens injured when a building hosting a prayer recital collapsed in West Java.\n\nIn 2018, seven teenagers rehearsing for a musical show were killed in Cirebon, east of Jakarta, when the building they were in collapsed.\n\nThat same year, at least 75 people were injured when the mezzanine floor at Indonesia’s stock exchange building in Jakarta collapsed into the lobby.\n\nWith Reuters and Agence France-Presse",

      "content": "Taiwan has become the world’s biggest importer of Russian naphtha, a petroleum derivative used to make chemicals needed for the semiconductor industry, despite the fact that it has joined other sanctions against Russia and considers itself an ally of Ukraine.\n\nIn the first half of 2025, Taiwan imported $1.3bn worth of Russian naphtha, and average monthly imports reached a level nearly six times higher than the 2022 average, according to a report published on Wednesday. Compared to the first half of 2024, Taiwan’s naphtha imports this year increased by 44%.\n\nTaiwan has elsewhere been reiterating its support for Ukraine in the war with Russia. On Sunday, Taiwan’s foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, signed a pact in Poland to provide support for children in Ukraine affected by Russia’s invasion.\n\nAfter Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Taiwan joined international sanctions against Moscow. It has also imposed export controls to prevent the island’s hi-tech equipment from being used by Russia’s military.\n\nBut Moscow’s ability to continue with the war is funded in part by energy exports, with billions of dollars coming from Taiwan.\n\nSince February 2022, Taiwan has imported 6.8m tonnes of Russian naphtha, worth $4.9bn, which is equal to 20% of Russia’s total exports of the petroleum product.\n\nThe US president, Donald Trump, has urged countries to stop buying Russian oil.\n\nThe findings come from a report published on Wednesday by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finnish thinktank, in collaboration with a consortium of European, Russian and Taiwanese NGOs.\n\nNaphtha is a crude oil product that is used to make chemicals required for manufacturing semiconductors, electronic components that are the backbone of Taiwan’s economy and which are vital for global industry.\n\nDespite joining other sanctions against Russia, Taiwan, which is overwhelmingly reliant on imports for its energy needs, has not imposed restrictions on purchases of Russian fossil fuels.\n\nJoseph Webster, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that revenue from Taiwan’s purchases of Russian naphtha “are not immaterial to the Kremlin’s revenues.”.\n\nTaiwan imports about 97% of its energy, a fact that experts have highlighted as a key vulnerability in the event of a conflict with China. It is a self-governing democracy but China claims it as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to annex the island.\n\nMany analysts have drawn comparisons between Russia’s designs on Ukraine and China’s plans for Taiwan. The conflict is closely watched in Taiwan and has spurred an interest in civil defence training programmes. There is a concern that China’s support for Russia during the war in Ukraine could be reciprocated by Moscow in the event of a Chinese conflict with Taiwan.\n\nBut some analysts said that Taiwan’s purchases of Russian oil should not be over-interpreted. “This looks like opportunism by Taiwan’s petrochemical industry,” said John Lough, the head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre. Lough said that even if the money from Taiwan helped to fill the Kremlin’s coffers, “it’s a stretch to think that [Russia] will be willing or able to provide military support to China in the event of increased Chinese pressure on Taiwan”.\n\nWebster said: “While Moscow and Beijing seek to absorb Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively, the two authoritarian powers are applying different approaches along different timelines. Moscow’s illegal invasion was a desperate attempt to halt Ukraine’s western orientation, but Beijing is much more patient and believes time is on its side.”\n\nHsin Hsuan Sun, a director at the Environmental Rights Foundation and co-author of the report, said: “Taiwan cannot afford to ignore the risks created by its growing dependence on Russian fossil fuel”. Sun said that the reliance “undermines Taiwan’s credibility with democratic allies”.",

      "content": "China’s ruling Communist party (CCP) has replaced the head of its powerful international department two months after he disappeared from public life.\n\nLiu Jianchao, an influential official who had been widely tipped to be the next foreign minister, was reportedly detained while returning from an overseas trip in late July. He has not been seen publicly since.\n\nLiu’s profile on the CCP’s international department website has been replaced by one of Liu Haixing, a former director of the foreign ministry’s European department. The change was apparent on Tuesday but was not accompanied by any official announcement. Liu Jianchao’s personal profile page has been taken offline.\n\nThe CCP’s international department handles relations with foreign political parties and socialist states.\n\nLiu Jianchao frequently met foreign dignitaries and had recently visited the UK. He is fluent in English and studied international relations at Oxford University, served in China’s mission to the UK and was widely tipped to be the next foreign minister.\n\nHe is the most high-level diplomat to go missing since China ousted its former foreign minister Qin Gang in 2023. Qin, who has not been heard from since, was replaced by his predecessor, Wang Yi.\n\nLiu Haixing may now be a more likely candidate to replace Wang as China’s top diplomat in the next reshuffle.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Liu Jianchao had been placed under investigation for alleged corruption and violations of party discipline, citing people briefed on the matter. Liu himself has previously worked for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China’s graft-busting agency.\n\nOne of Liu’s deputies, Sun Haiyan, was reportedly taken away for questioning in August but she has since appeared at public events and represented China in meetings with foreign countries.\n\nIn recent years a string of senior Chinese officials have been removed from public life without explanation. The former defence minister Li Shangfu was sacked in 2023 and later expelled from the CCP, along with Wei Fenghe, another former defence minister. Their punishments were officially confirmed to be related to a corruption investigation in the People’s Liberation Army.\n\nPeople purged from the senior ranks of the CCP may be left to live their remaining years in political and social exile or they may face harsh criminal penalties.\n\nCCP inspectors have punished more than 6 million people for corruption and other disciplinary offences since Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012.",

      "content": "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, has played a leading role in directing US strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug boats, according to three people familiar with the situation. At times, his role has superseded that of Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and national security adviser.\n\nThe strikes on the Venezuelan boats allegedly carrying narcotics, which the administration has claimed were necessary because interdiction did not work, have been orchestrated through the homeland security council (HSC), which Miller leads as the homeland security adviser.\n\nMiller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Donald Trump’s second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.\n\nAs a result, the HSC has taken the lead on engaging the Venezuelan boats, the people said, a situation evidenced by his top deputy, Tony Salisbury, and others being the gatekeepers to details about what boat to strike until they are about to occur.\n\nThat was the case for instance with the second Venezuelan boat hit with hellfire missiles on 15 September. While the White House was informed the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.\n\nA White House spokesperson said in a statement the strikes were directed by Trump, saying he oversaw all elements of foreign policy. “The entire administration is working together to execute the president’s directive with clear success,” the statement said.\n\nBut the previously unreported role of Miller – and his massive influence with the president – also explains how striking Venezuelan boats became a major priority, and why Trump has been happy to deploy extraordinary military force to the region.\n\nThe US military presence presently involves the Iwo Jima amphibious ready group – including the USS San Antonio, USS Iwo Jima, USS Fort Lauderdale carrying 4,500 sailors – and the 22nd marine expeditionary unit, with 2,200 marines, the Guardian has previously reported.\n\nMiller’s role also opens a window into the dubious legal justification that has been advanced for the strikes, which has been a matter of deep controversy amid allegations it amounted to extrajudicial murder in international waters.\n\nView image in fullscreen This screen grab from a video posted by Donald Trump shows what he says is US military forces conducting a strike on a boat carrying alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea on 15 September. Photograph: US President Donald Trump’s TRUTH Social account/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince the start of the Venezuela campaign, White House officials have sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article II powers, which allows the president to use military force in self defense in limited engagements.\n\nThe self defense argument revolves around Trump’s designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Miller in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro – and so the presence of the cartel’s members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.\n\n“It is a drug cartel that is running Venezuela,” Miller told reporters at the White House earlier this month as he characterized Maduro as the head of the cartel. “It is not a government, it is a drug cartel, a narco-trafficking organization that is running Venezuela.”\n\nBut the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.\n\nA divided three-judge panel at the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit on 2 September ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act were unlawful, because the administration had not met the high burden of showing Tren de Aragua was an arm of the Maduro regime.\n\nIt remains unclear who signed off on the legal justification for the strikes. Neither the HSC nor the national security council have dedicated legal advisers like in previous administrations, after the White House started restructuring the national security council in May.\n\nBut multiple people said it was approved by the Pentagon general counsel, Earl Matthews, who was until recently a Trump White House lawyer; the justice department; and the White House counsel’s office, which has a lawyer tasked with handling national security council matters.",

      "content": "Advocates are calling on the New South Wales government to scrap strip-searches of young people altogether, saying a landmark court ruling found “systemic” issues with the way police have been using their powers.\n\nJustice Dina Yehia handed down her findings in the NSW supreme court on Tuesday in a class action brought by Slater and Gordon Lawyers and the Redfern Legal Centre against the state of NSW.\n\nThe case alleged the vast majority of strip-searches conducted at music festivals between 2016 and 2022 – some of which involved children – were unlawful.\n\nYehia ruled that police suspicion that a person has a prohibited drug in their possession “is not sufficient to conduct a strip-search”.\n\nBut data shows this has been the major reason for police to carry out strip-searches across the board. Of the strip-searches conducted by police in the 2018-19 financial year, 91% were based on suspicion that a person possessed prohibited drugs, according to a 2019 University of NSW report that was commissioned by the Redfern Legal Centre.\n\nYehia noted in her judgment that while police can carry out a pat-down search based on the reasonable suspicion of drug possession, escalating this to a strip-search requires the circumstances to be necessary, urgent and serious.\n\nSam Lee, a senior solicitor involved in the class action with Redfern Legal Centre, said the judgment could pave the way for people who are strip-searched to take legal action – and not just those at music festivals, but more broadly.\n\n“What this judgment says is that the current practice has been unlawful, and not just by one officer, but at a systemic level,” she said.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nYehia found that a 2018 strip search of the lead plaintiff, Raya Meredith, was unlawful after a drug dog sniffed in her direction while she was walking into Splendour in the Grass. Meredith, who was then 27, was taken by police into a makeshift tent where she was told to strip and remove her tampon. While she was bent over during the search, a male police officer walked in.\n\nIt is yet to be determined what the lead plaintiff’s win will mean for the rest of the more than 3,000 members of the class action.\n\nThe NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, said it was difficult to “put a number on” on how much the state could owe in compensation against the group members because they did not yet know how many people would come forward with a claim.\n\nLee is calling for the NSW government to follow the ACT’s lead and cease police powers to strip-search people under 18, unless there is a court order for them to do so.\n\n“If they don’t change the legislation and police continue on with the same practice, then the state is going to be up for more money,” Lee said.\n\nThe NSW Greens spokesperson for drug law reform, Cate Faehrmann, backed Lee’s calls for an end to the strip-searching of children.\n\nShe said legislation should also expressly prohibit police from strip-searching people on the suspicion of minor drug possession because she did not have “any faith” police won’t continue this practice following the judgment. Faehrmann said the Greens were working on bill to propose this.\n\n“The Greens are offering to work constructively with the Minns government to support sensible laws on this issue, which must start at the very least with banning strip-searches on children,” she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was also entitled to exemplary damages, but this figure has not yet been determined.\n\nJeremy King, a lawyer in Victoria specialising in police accountability, said this was a “pretty extraordinary finding”.\n\n“You often see poor conduct by police in matters such as these, but rarely judges act on that,” he said.\n\nAsked on Wednesday afternoon if she thought Meredith deserved an apology, Catley said: “Yes, I apologise. What happened to Ms Meredith, the police have already acknowledged, was unlawful. It should not have happened to her.”\n\nNSW’s new police commissioner, Mal Lanyon, told reporters on Wednesday that police had changed their practices since 2018, when Meredith was strip-searched.\n\nHe said one of the main reasons police strip-search in general is to search for weapons.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at music festivals he said police searches were focused now on the supply of prohibited drugs.\n\n“We have seen the terrible toll that drugs take at music festivals. We’ve seen young lives lost, and I think it’s really important, as I said, that we do have sniffer dogs as a tool,” he said.",

He reportedly operates a drug gang in the Zavaleta neighbourhood of Buenos Aires.\n\nMatias Ozorio, who is thought to be the main suspect’s right-hand man, was also detained in Peru.\n\nLast Wednesday, the bodies of 20-year-old cousins Morena Verdi and Brenda del Castillo, and 15-year-old Lara Gutierrez were discovered buried in the garden of a house in the southern suburbs of Argentina’s capital. They had gone missing five days earlier.\n\nBuenos Aires Security Minister Javier Alonso said the trio were tortured and murdered on a closed social media group of 45 users, adding that the video was intended as a “warning” over an alleged drug theft.\n\nThe footage came to light after a suspect in the case was questioned, Alonso added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of Argentinians took to the streets of Buenos Aires on Saturday to demand justice for the victims and to call for action from the government of President Javier Milei against increasing “narco” influence in Argentina.\n\n“Women must be protected more than ever,” said Leonel del Castillo, whose daughter Brenda was one of the three victims. He had been unable to identify her body because the torture was so severe, the AFP news agency quoted him as saying.\n\nDemonstrators held banners with slogans including “It was a narco-femicide!” and “Our lives are not disposable!”.\n\nAntonio del Castillo, the grandfather of the killed cousins, described their killers as “bloodthirsty”.",

      "description": "EU&#039;s Kallas says the bloc is working quickly on a loan for Ukraine that would leverage frozen Russian assets.",
      "content": "EU’s Kallas says the bloc is working quickly on a loan for Ukraine that would leverage frozen Russian assets.\n\nMajor European powers have voiced support for a proposal to use frozen Russian assets as collateral for an enormous loan to Ukraine to fund its reconstruction.\n\nThe so-called Reparations Loan, first outlined by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in mid-September, would leverage Russian funds frozen in European banks to back a 140 billion euro ($164.4bn) loan for Ukraine guaranteed either by the European Union’s (EU) next long-term budget or EU member states. Under the plan, Kyiv would not need to repay the loan until Russia covers the costs of war reparations.\n\nWhile some EU states have raised concerns over the legality and risk-sharing aspects of the scheme, support appeared to build on Wednesday at an EU summit in Denmark, Copenhagen. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal all endorsed using seized Russian funds to support Ukraine.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who was hosting the meeting, said that the commission’s plan “is actually quite a good way forward.”\n\nShe added: “There are some legal questions that have to be asked and I’m confident that we will find a way through this. But the whole idea of using the frozen assets I think is a good idea.”\n\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and French President Emmanuel Macron indicated they were open to the plan, provided legal and financial risks are addressed. “We need to remain a place that’s attractive and reliable, we Europeans,” said Macron. “That means that when assets are frozen, we respect international law.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that despite some divergence, the EU was working quickly to reach an agreement on the loan. “It’s not supported by everybody yet, so there’s still a lot of work to do,” she told reporters on the sidelines of the summit. “But if we don’t take these [Russian] assets into account, then it is on our taxpayers. That’s for sure.”\n\n‘Illegal seizure of Russian property’\n\nThe Kremlin has denounced the proposed Reparations Loan, saying any use of frozen Russian funds for this purpose would be “pure theft”.\n\n“We are talking about plans for the illegal seizure of Russian property. In Russian, we call that simply theft,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. He warned that anyone who misappropriated Russia’s assets or the income they generate “will be prosecuted in one way or another” and “called to account”.\n\nPeskov also claimed such actions would erode confidence in Europe’s financial institutions. “The boomerang will very seriously hit those who are the main depositories, countries that are interested in investment attractiveness,” he said.\n\nA World Bank study this year estimated that as of December 2024, Ukraine’s reconstruction would cost $524bn over the next decade – about 2.8 times its gross domestic product for that year.\n\nThere are about $300bn in frozen Russian assets, including 210 billion euros ($247bn) held in Europe. Of that, 185 billion euros ($217bn) is in Euroclear, a Brussels-based central securities depository. Interest earned on Moscow’s frozen assets is already being used to fund a separate loan program for Ukraine organised by the Group of Seven major world powers, and this would not be impacted by the EU’s new proposal.",

The focus has been on picking the right silicon — another shorthand term for semiconductor — that offers \"the best price performance\" per chip.\n\n\"We're not religious about what the chips are. And ... that has meant the best price performance solution has been Nvidia for years and years now,\" Scott said. \"We will literally entertain anything in order to ensure that we've got enough capacity to meet this demand.\"\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft has been using some of its own chips.\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft launched the Azure Maia AI Accelerator which is designed for AI workloads, as well as the Cobalt CPU. In addition, the firm is reportedly working on its next-generation of semiconductor products. Last week, the U.S. technology giant unveiled new cooling technology using \"microfluids\" to solve the issue of overheating chips.\n\nWhen asked if the longer term plan is to have mainly Microsoft chips in the firm's own data centers, Scott said: \"Absolutely,\" adding that the company is using \"lots of Microsoft\" silicon right now.\n\nThe focus on chips is part of a strategy to eventually design an entire system that goes into the data center, Scott said.\n\n\"It's about the entire system design. It's the networks and the cooling and you want to be able to have the freedom to make the decisions that you need to make in order to really optimize your compute to the workload,\" Scott said.\n\nMicrosoft and its rivals Google and Amazon are designing their own chips to not only reduce reliance on Nvidia and AMD, but also to make their products more efficient for their specific requirements.",

Jonathan Ernst | Reuters\n\nThe U.S. government entered a shutdown on Wednesday, sparking conversation across global markets as investors weighed the potential impact on the wider economy. Although government shutdowns typically have a negligible impact on capital markets, the timing of this one is significant. U.S. jobs data due to be published on Friday will be delayed by the move — clouding the outlook for the Federal Reserve just weeks ahead of its next meeting. President Donald Trump has also threatened to use the shutdown to enact \"a lot\" of job cuts in the public sector. With no clear path toward a deal, it's also unclear how long the impasse will keep federal offices closed. During Trump's first term in office, a partial shutdown took hold — the longest in history.\n\nAverage market changes over recent shutdowns Shutdown period Full days Type of shutdown S&P 500 (%) net change VIX points net change DXY net change 10-year net change 12/22/18-1/25/19 35 Partial 6 -8 -2 -17 1/20/18-1/22/18 3 Partial 2 4 -2 15 10/1/13-10/17/13 16 Full 3 -1 -2 -14 12/16/95-1/6/96 21 Full -3 4 0 1 11/14/95-11/19/95 5 Full 3 -1 1 -10 10/5/90-10/9/90 3 Partial -5 3 -3 2 Average 1 0 -1 -4\n\nSource: Bank of America\n\nU.S. risk assets were shaky on Wednesday. Gold — typically viewed as a safe haven asset in times of economic or geopolitical turbulence — hit its 39th record high this year. European stocks edged higher in late morning trade, gaining momentum after a lackluster open, and shares listed in Asia were mixed in Wednesday's session. Meanwhile, global government bonds cooled after yields on bonds issued by European government ticked higher in early trade. However, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield traded 4 basis points lower after a surprise decline in private payrolls.\n\nInvestors may look elsewhere amid U.S. 'dysfunction'\n\nThe shutdown adds to concerns over U.S. institutional credibility, fiscal position and \"dysfunction,\" according to Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen. \"I'm certainly struck by how much political capital the Trump administration seems to be willing to spend on reforming, if I can put it that way, the Federal Reserve, influencing the Federal Reserve,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday. \"The Fed is ultimately the bedrock institution for global capital markets. So, the long-end term premium is all under pressure, and I would expect that theme to continue,\" he added — but he noted that he \"would be surprised if the market doesn't ultimately shrug this off.\"\n\nGet the CNBC Daily Open report in your inbox every morning and keep up to date with the markets wherever you are. Subscribe\n\nNeil Birrell, chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Premier Miton, said that a prolonged shutdown was likely to dampen risk-on sentiment across global markets. \"With bond markets reacting to extreme government borrowing requirements, credit spreads being tight and equity markets near highs with unforgiving valuations, it is hardly surprising to see investors move to perceived safe haven assets when a negative event such as a U.S. government shutdown comes to town,\" he told CNBC. \"Investors have been complacent over the risks we face, and negative surprises will provoke a reaction. Any form of diversification looks appealing, including other metals such as silver, crypto and maybe other commodities as well.\"\n\nFX impact\n\nJoe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM U.S., noted that the biggest outcome for markets could be further pressure on the greenback or an impact on the Fed's October rates decision. \"For the most part US government shutdowns tend to result in a modest bout of speculative behavior by global investors around rates and currencies. This edition of the American fiscal follies is no different,\" he told CNBC via email on Wednesday. \"For there to be a greater impact on global markets the U.S. government shutdown will need to be extended throughout the month approaching the 2018-2019 record shutdown. Should that occur, that would likely impact the Federal Reserve policy decision at the end of the month which would likely impact global mass flows, interest rates and foreign exchange values.\" Brusuelas noted that mass firings of federal workers \"would likely result in further declines in the value of the dollar resulting in capital flows into the euro and yen .\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Dollar index\n\nWidespread layoffs could also have a knock-on effect on European industry, Brusuelas told CNBC. \"Demand for European exports such as autos will decline notably which would add to the pressure felt by German industrials,\" he said.\n\nInvestors should 'look past shutdown fears'\n\nHowever, in a note on Tuesday, analysts at Swiss investment bank UBS said they did not see the shutdown as a major risk event, despite conceding that it was not a welcome development for global investors. \"Shutdowns have historically had only a muted market impact,\" they explained. \"Past government shutdowns have typically caused modest and short-lived volatility in equity and bond markets because investors understand that the economic impact is also typically quite modest and short-lived … Treasury auctions and payments would continue as normal, and while IPO activity and some regulatory processes may pause, we think neither poses a meaningful risk of market dislocation.\"\n\nwatch now",

      "content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post pending oral arguments in January on whether President Donald Trump has legal cause to fire her.\n\nThe court's move is a blow to Trump, who has repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked federal courts to allow him to terminate Cook from the Fed's Board of Governors without delay while her lawsuit challenging her removal is pending.\n\nTrump has cited claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud as his reason for firing her from the seven-member board.\n\nBut his first effort to remove her in August came after he, for months, had unsuccessfully pressured her, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, and other members of the central bank to cut interest rates\n\nCook denies any wrongdoing in connection with statements she made before joining the Fed in applying for mortgages on two homes she owns in Michigan and Georgia. She has not been legally charged with making false statements on those mortgage applications.\n\nIn its order on Wednesday, the Supreme Court bluntly said, without elaboration, that Trump's request to stay a federal district court's injunction against removing Cook is \"deferred pending oral argument in January 2026.\" The actual date of the argument was not set.\n\nThe order said that the Supreme Court's clerk would establish a schedule for the filing of legal briefs in the case, including ones by outside parties who have an interest in the outcome.\n\nThe Trump administration's effort to remove Cook is seen as a potential landmark case on whether to maintain the Fed's long-held veneer of independence from political interference.\n\nTrump has insisted that the accusations against Cook meet the standard of \"cause\" required by the Federal Reserve Act to remove a Fed official.\n\nThe Department of Justice in earlier filings had called the injunction barring Trump from firing Cook while her lawsuit is pending \"yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority.\n\nCook's lawyers, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, in a statement after the Supreme Court issued its order, said, \"The Court's decision rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai, in a statement, said, \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\"\n\n\"We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January,\" Desai said.\n\nThe Fed declined to comment other than restating its position that it will abide by any court decisions.\n\nWednesday's order allows the Fed to conduct business as usual, at least through the end of the year.\n\nCook will vote at the Federal Open Market Committee's October and December meetings, and possibly at the FOMC's January meeting.\n\nThe FOMC in September voted to lower its benchmark borrowing rate by a quarter-percentage point.\n\nIn addition, officials indicated additional quarter-percentage-point reductions at each of the two remaining meetings this year.\n\nCook participated in the FOMC during that meeting over Trump's protests.\n\nShe voted for the quarter-point cut, while Trump's newest Fed governor appointment, Stephen Miran, dissented from the cut, saying he wanted a half-point reduction.\n\nMiran also indicated in the committee's \"dot plot\" of individual expectations that he wants to see another 1.25 percentage points lopped off the funds rate by the end of 2025.\n\nCook has not indicated a preference, though, like Powell, she has advocated a cautious approach to easing policy.\n\n— CNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this story.",

      "description": "CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 ranks the best financial advisors and top firms for 2025. Here's how to pick the best financial planner for you and your family.",
      "content": "Amid economic uncertainty, the best financial advisors can provide a steady hand to investors in any stage of life or with any level of wealth. Whether you're early in your career or nearing your golden years, financial advisors can help you meet key milestones and address planning needs such as saving for retirement, investing a windfall, funding college education, managing portfolio income or shaping your legacy. But finding a good financial advisor isn't easy. To identify financial advisors who may best meet your needs, you can ask people you know for referrals and use resources such as CNBC's Financial Advisor 100. Verify advisors' credentials and check for complaints via the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's BrokerCheck or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure, then interview those on your short list. We created CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 in 2019 to recognize the country's best financial advisors and top financial advisory firms. CNBC accepts no payment for placement. Our team uses data analysis, with data partner AccuPoint Solutions, and editorial review to compile CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list. For 2025, the process began with 40,563 registered investment advisor firms, or RIAs, and that list was reduced to 1,015 that met CNBC's requirements. CNBC surveyed the finalists for more details about their practice and verified responses against publicly available resources. Then AccuPoint used CNBC's weighted criteria to rank the firms. (Read more about the methodology below.) For 2025, CNBC's top advisors collectively manage $223 billion. The firms have an average of 32 years in business.\n\nWhat is a fiduciary financial advisor?\n\nA fiduciary financial advisor acts in the best interest of the client, regardless of how that affects their business or bottom line. Some financial advisors, such as RIAs, are bound by the fiduciary standard. However, investment brokers must follow a suitability standard, which means that recommendations may be appropriate but not necessarily the best option.\n\nWhat steps should someone take when choosing a financial advisor?\n\nFinding the right financial advisor may require some homework, but you can start with referrals from trusted colleagues, friends or family members. Depending on your needs, you can check for advisors' active credentials, such as certified financial planner, or CFP; certified public accountant, or CPA; or chartered financial analyst, or CFA. You can also check for regulatory violations and customer complaints, also called disclosures, via BrokerCheck from FINRA, and the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website from the SEC. State regulators may provide more information for smaller firms. Before choosing a financial advisor, you should meet and interview prospective candidates. These 10 questions from the CFP Board could help narrow down your list: 1. What are your qualifications and credentials?\n\n2. What services do you offer?\n\n3. Will you have a fiduciary duty to me?\n\n4. What is your approach to financial planning?\n\n5. What types of clients do you typically work with?\n\n6. Will you be the only advisor working with me?\n\n7. How will I pay for your services?\n\n8. How much do you typically charge?\n\n9. Do others stand to gain from the financial advice you give me?\n\n10. Have you ever been publicly disciplined for unethical or unlawful actions in your career?\n\nWhat's the difference between a fee-only financial advisor and a commission-based advisor?\n\nBefore hiring a financial advisor, it's important to understand their compensation structure and how it could influence their recommendations. Typically, financial advisors are paid via commission, fees or a hybrid of the two. Fee-only means the advisor does not receive a commission from products. Some fee-only examples may include flat amounts for one-time projects, hourly fees, monthly retainers or assets under management, or AUM. Commission-based advice may be the lowest-cost option for advice about a specific financial product. However, commission-based advice can present a conflict of interest in some cases. By comparison, AUM is generally a set percentage each year, but the amount paid varies based on the size of your portfolio. Some advisors paid via AUM have minimum asset requirements, which can be less inclusive to investors with a smaller portfolio.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of using a robo-advisor vs. a human financial advisor?\n\nRobo-advisors are algorithms developed by companies to automatically invest your money based on your risk tolerance. Some robo-advisors offer additional features, such as access to a human advisor and tax-loss harvesting, which uses losses to offset other portfolio gains. By contrast, a human financial advisor can offer tailored, comprehensive financial planning to meet specific goals. This may include guidance on investing, taxes, insurance, retirement planning, estate planning and other areas.\n\nIn 2024, the median robo-advisor fee was around 0.25% of assets per year, based on 16 U.S.-based platforms, according to Morningstar's 2025 Robo-Advisor Report. However, fees can be significantly higher, depending on the platform. To compare, financial advisors typically charge around 1% of assets under management, or 100 basis points, depending on the size of your portfolio. If you're new to investing, most experts recommend starting with your workplace 401(k), rather than a robo-advisor, and contributing at least up to your employer's matching contribution. Without a workplace plan, you could consider a Roth individual retirement account, which provides tax-free growth, among other benefits. Fidelity recommends aiming for at least 15% of pretax income for retirement, including your employer match. The most popular 401(k) investment, target-date funds, also offer automated asset allocation, depending on your planned retirement date.\n\nMorsa Images | E+ | Getty Images\n\nFinancial advisor FAQs\n\nWhat are the requirements for a certified financial planner? Certified financial planners, or CFPs, meet four requirements: education, exam, experience and ethics. They must complete a CFP Board-registered program and hold a bachelor's degree. Professionals also must prove knowledge and competency by passing an exam, completing experience hours and meeting ongoing ethics and continuing education standards.\n\nWhat are the red flags or warning signs of a bad financial advisor? There are hundreds of thousands of financial advisors in the U.S., and picking the right one can feel overwhelming. However, there are ways to check for red flags and narrow down your prospect list.\n\nOne red flag is a lack of transparency about advisor compensation, which is required in Form ADV Part 2A for RIAs.\n\nAnother red flag could be an advisor who pushes products without a firm understanding of your goals, risk tolerance and timeline.\n\nYou can verify credentials via issuing organizations, such as the CFP Board. You can also find regulatory violations and customer complaints via FINRA's BrokerCheck and the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website.\n\nHow do you choose a financial advisor for retirement planning? Advisors who specialize in retirement planning typically have expertise in investment management, portfolio distribution, taxes, Social Security, Medicare, long-term care, legacy planning and other key issues.\n\nCredentials such as CFP or RICP — retirement income certified professional — may signal expertise, but you should also weigh years of experience and other specialized training.\n\nWhile interviewing prospects, you should ask about their philosophy for retirement income and lifetime tax planning.\n\nThe right candidate will discuss their holistic approach to meeting your financial goals, rather than immediately pushing products.\n\nWhat are common financial strategies recommended by financial advisors? If you're struggling with cash flow or debt issues, your financial advisor may start by reviewing your monthly income and spending to create a realistic budget.\n\nWith a clearer picture of cash flow, an advisor can make investing recommendations based on your goals, risk tolerance and timeline.\n\nYour advisor may also recommend tax strategies, based on your financial goals, to help minimize your yearly and lifetime tax liability.\n\nLong-term investing goals may include funding education for your children or saving for retirement.\n\nIt's also important to address legacy goals by creating an estate plan.\n\nHow do I find the best financial advisor near me for young professionals? Young professionals may seek a financial advisor to help juggle competing financial priorities while building their career.\n\nKey planning issues may include starting to invest, paying off student loans, navigating employee benefits, buying a first home and saving for a wedding or having children.\n\nSome financial advisors work with younger investors and don't have minimum asset requirements. These planners may charge one-time, hourly or monthly fees rather than a percentage for assets under management.\n\nYou can use directories from the CFP Board, XY Planning Network or the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors to find a fiduciary financial advisor.\n\nMethodology: How we picked the best financial advisors for 2025",

      "title": "From Elon Musk to Microsoft's Satya Nadella: Tech leaders that were once H-1B visa holders",
      "description": "Since its creation in 1990, the H-1B visa program has been utilized by a number of foreign workers who would rise the ranks into prominent leaders.",
      "content": "In this article EBAY\n\nCSCO\n\nZM\n\nTSLA\n\nMSFT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nEvgenia Parajanian | Istock | Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump is looking to restrict and overhaul the H-1 B visa program, which has allowed U.S. companies to hire foreign talent in occupations such as IT, healthcare and engineering for decades. The program has been a topic of debate among lawmakers in Washington for years, with many opponents arguing that it removes job opportunities for U.S. nationals and is rife with abuse. In response, Trump announced a plan to impose $100,000 fees on H-1B applications, which could severely impact American companies' ability to support the visas. One thing that can't be disputed, however, is that the program has been part of the journey of a considerable number of American technology and business leaders since its inception in 1990. Here is a list of some of the highest-profile ones.\n\nElon Musk\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man and the founder of a raft of prominent tech companies in the U.S., is not only one of the most prominent H-1B visa recipients but also one of the most vocal advocates of the program. Originally born in South Africa, Musk moved to the U.S. in 1992 when he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania to pursue his studies. He later attended Stanford before dropping out to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in Silicon Valley.\n\nwatch now\n\nWhile some details of his early visa situation have been debated, Musk has gone on record saying the reason he is in the U.S., along with \"so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong,\" was the H-1B visa. Still, the billionaire, who has become highly involved in U.S. and global politics, has also supported the overhaul and reformation of the H-1B system in the past.\n\nEric Yuan\n\nEric Yuan, the 55-year-old founder and CEO of Zoom , immigrated to the U.S. from China in 1997 on an H-1B visa, though his journey was anything but easy. Yuan was sponsored for an H-1B visa by video conferencing company Webex — later acquired by Cisco Systems — but was only approved on his ninth try, he said on a Cloud Giant podcast in 2020.\n\nEric Yuan, founder and CEO of Zoom Video Communications, speaks at Concordia Annual Summit in New York on Sept. 25, 2024. Leigh Vogel | Concordia Summit | Getty Images\n\nDespite speaking very little English upon his arrival in the U.S., he would go on to launch Zoom in 2011. The company's IPO in 2019 valued Yuan's shares in the billions. While Yuan has not publicly commented much about the H-1B visa program, he told CNBC in 2019 that the United States' openness to immigration is healthy and that he expects that culture to persist.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nBorn and raised in India, Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft , is also a former recipient of an H-1B visa, though his circumstances were quite unique. Having been in the U.S. since 1990, he held a highly coveted green card until he gave it up to bring his wife into the country through a successful, but otherwise risky, H-1B visa application in 1994.\n\n\"The idea that you have to give up your green card to get an H-1B is, in retrospect, silly. And so therefore let us in fact take the reform so that it works for us, both our security but as well as our competitiveness,\" said Nadella in a 2017 interview with CNBC. Back in 2017, speaking on the 'Make Me Smart' podcast, Nadella defended the H-1B visa program, saying that it provided Microsoft with high-skilled labor that helped it remain globally competitive, though he welcomed an executive order reviewing H-1B for abuses under the first Trump administration.\n\nJayshree Ullal\n\nJayshree Ullal, CEO of cloud networking company Arista Networks, was born in the United Kingdom and raised in New Delhi, before she moved to the U.S. at the age of 16 and began her studies at San Francisco State University. After completing a master's degree at Santa Clara University, she went on to work for prominent tech companies, including Fairchild Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Cisco. Somewhere in that time, Ullal had been a recipient of an H-1B visa, a representative of the CEO had previously disclosed to Forbes. Arista did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nPresident and CEO of Arista Networks, Jayshree Ullal. Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nWhile details of Ullal's H-1B journey are unknown, she has voiced support for immigration reform and easier pathways for foreign workers to the U.S. in the past. Speaking to Times of India in 2023, she said the immigration process had become overly challenging with permanent residence visas taking up to 15 years to secure, which is \"a large chunk of a professional person's work life.\" \"At Arista, we believe that the best developers can come from anywhere and there is a global distribution of engineering talent — virtual or physical,\" she added. Ullal is one of the handful of immigrant billionaires in the U.S. today with a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nJeffrey Skoll\n\nJeff Skoll, the first President of eBay — now a philanthropist and chairman of Capricorn Investment Group — is another former H-1B visa holder who has advocated for the program, while supporting targeted reforms. As a Canadian, he graduated from the University of Toronto in 1987 before he came to America to study at Stanford University. He would later obtain an H-1B visa in 1996 when he began working for eBay and its founder, Pierre Omidyar.\n\nJeff Skoll Getty Images",

      "description": "EV sales during the third quarter are expected to be a record, ahead of federal incentives of up to $7,500 ending in September.",
      "content": "Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning on display at the New York International Auto Show on March 28, 2024.\n\nDETROIT – Strong electric vehicle sales are leading to robust third-quarter results for major automakers, as consumers flocked to car dealerships before the end of $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs.\n\nFord Motor, General Motors and Hyundai all reported record quarterly sales of all-electric vehicles from July through September.\n\nBoth GM and Ford said third-quarter sales overall increased roughly 8% from a year earlier, with EV sales more than doubling for GM. Ford said sales of its EVs increased by 30% compared with the third quarter of 2024.\n\nHyundai reported its namesake brand recorded a 13% year-over-year sales increase during the third quarter, also led by doubling sales of all-electric vehicles.\n\nGM said it remained the top automaker in U.S. sales through the third quarter of this year, with the Detroit company estimating a market share of 17.2% – its highest position since 2015.\n\n\"No one is in a stronger position for a changing U.S. market than GM. We have the best lineup of ICE and EV vehicles we've ever had, and our brands have grown market share with consistently strong pricing, low incentives and inventory,\" GM North American President Duncan Aldred said in a release.\n\nGM on Wednesday estimated the industrywide sales pace for the third quarter was 16.7 million to 16.9 million units — higher than some earlier industry estimates.\n\nU.S. EV sales during the third quarter are expected to be a record, as buyers pulled ahead plans to purchase a new zero-emissions vehicle ahead federal EV incentives of up to $7,500 ending in September.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley on Tuesday said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if sales of EVs fell from an industry market share of around 10% to 12% this month — which is expected to be a record — to 5% after the incentive program ends.\n\nCox Automotive forecasts sales of EVs hit 410,000 during the third quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. That would easily be the highest amount of EVs ever sold in a quarter in the U.S., as well as a record 10% market share.\n\nSales of EVs as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that also qualified for federal incentives are expected to assist in boosting third-quarter vehicle sales up between 4% and 7%, according to forecasts from Cox and CarMax's Edmunds.\n\nSome automakers are trying to keep their EV sales momentum going after the end of the tax credit. The incentives expired as part of the Trump administration's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" which stripped the old enticement but included some perks for buying a U.S.-assembled vehicle, regardless of it being an EV.\n\nHyundai on Wednesday said it is reducing pricing for its 2026 Ioniq 5 EV by up to $9,800 and offering a $7,500 cash incentive on 2025 models, matching the federal credits.\n\n\"We're very bullish when it comes to EV sales in the marketplace,\" said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor America, adding the brand is evaluating pricing on other models as well. \"There's going to be a little bit of a reset in October, probably even November, but the EV market will settle, and at that point, we view this as an opportunity. ... We're not backing off.\"\n\nGM and Ford also essentially extended the use of a $7,500 U.S. tax credit on leases of electric vehicles, Reuters reported Monday, by rolling out programs to their retailers under which the automakers' financing arm would initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers' inventory by making down payments on them.",

Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the US.\n\nFor decades, global real estate revolved around what could be seen — gleaming office towers, shopping malls, and trophy hotels, but that has increasingly shifted to \"invisible\" property: cloud and data centers.\n\n\"The world of real estate is changing from what I'd call the 'visible' to the 'invisible,'\" said Kishore Moorjani, CEO of CapitaLand Investment's alternatives and private funds team.\n\n\"[It's] everything we can't see but we use: the cloud, as we like calling it, lives in the data center,\" he noted during a panel at the Milken Institute Asia Summit held in Singapore. \"That's what's driving the value shift.\"\n\nAccording to a recent 2025 data center investor interest survey by real estate services firm CBRE, 95% of major investors worldwide plan to increase their investments in data centers. Of the 92 major investors polled, 41% said that they planned to allocate $500 million or more in equity to the data center sector in 2025, compared to 30% last year.\n\nData center demand has surged in recent years, largely driven by the explosion in AI workloads, which require vast computing power, electrical power, cooling and networking infrastructure. Goldman Sachs forecasts that global power demand from data centers will rise 50% by 2027 and by as much as 165% by 2030.\n\nStuart Crow, CEO of APAC capital markets at global real estate firm JLL, said investors are reallocating portfolios away from traditional sectors and into alternatives.\n\n\"A big part of that is data centers, and now battery storage and infrastructure that's associated with that,\" he said at the same panel.\n\nGoodwin Gaw, managing principal at Gaw Capital Partners, another panelist, added that his firm is investing in China's data centers.",

      "description": "A number of European countries have reported airspace incursions involving either Russian jets or, allegedly, drones recently.",
      "content": "A sign warns about a no-fly zone in Copenhagen, Denmark, on September 29, 2025. From Monday, September 29, through Friday, October 3, all civilian drone flights are prohibited in Danish airspace in connection with the EU summit. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe creation of a drone wall in Europe is likely to be central to talks among European leaders this week, following a spate of incursions into the region's airspace and increasing concerns over the security threat they pose. Poland, Estonia and Romania — countries on Europe's northern and eastern flank and close to Russia — have all reported airspace incursions involving either Russian jets or drones recently. Norway, Denmark and Germany have also reported incidents involving unidentified drones in their airspace in last week, causing disruption to airports and air traffic. Russia denies it's behind drone provocations against its European neighbors, describing them as \"unfounded accusations.\" Drones targeted Danish airports last week, causing widespread disruption, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were spotted near military sites last weekend. The government said the disruption was the work of a \"professional actor\" but had no evidence of Russian involvement. European leaders, alarmed at the rise in airspace incursions and the security threat that drones pose, proposed building a drone wall to protect the region's eastern flank against potential attacks and incursions. Here's a brief guide to what form such a \"wall\" could take:\n\nWhat is a drone wall?\n\nA drone wall is not a physical wall, rather it's envisaged as a coordinated counter-drone system that could detect, track and intercept unidentified and unauthorized UAVs that are seen to be violating European airspace. The proposal of a drone wall, which is particularly supported by Baltic and Eastern European states, is intended as both a deterrence and defensive barrier, as well as a way to pool resources to bolster Europe's collective defense. There are obstacles to the creation of a drone wall, namely its financing, management — given its cross-border nature and the diversity of airspace security laws — as well as issues to do with technical integration, according to Miriam McNabb, editor in chief of the online Dronelife publication. \"Europe would need to ensure that various detection sensors, electronic warfare systems, and command networks can communicate seamlessly across multiple countries. Beyond the technical and financial hurdles, there are also geopolitical considerations. Officials are aware that building a highly visible counter-drone shield could heighten tensions with Russia, even as they work to establish credible defenses,\" she said in online analysis.\n\nPolice and army inspect damage to a house destroyed by debris from a shot down Russian drone in the village of Wyryki-Wola, eastern Poland, on September 10, 2025. Wojtek Radwanski | Afp | Getty Images\n\nExperts agree drone defense is overdue but some Europeans have poured cold water on the idea, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius appearing to pour cold water on the idea. \"I very much appreciate the idea of a drone wall, but we should pay attention to manage expectations. We are not talking about a concept that will be realized in the next three or four years,\" he told the Warsaw Security Forum last week, calling for \"drone defense, of course, but not by a drone wall.\" Nonetheless, NATO's Secretary General Mark Rutte said Tuesday that the \"drone wall initiative is timely and necessary\" while Luxembourg's Prime Minister Luc Frieden told CNBC he was was open to the idea.\n\nwatch now\n\nTaking no chances\n\nCopenhagen is taking no chances as it hosts European leaders in the capital for an EU summit on Wednesday, and the wider European Political Community grouping on Thursday, after having beefed up security and banning all civilian drone flights until Oct.3. Denmark's defense ministry said a number of European nations had contributed anti-drone equipment, expertise and personnel to help strengthen the country's defense against drones this week as leaders meet. Ukraine, an expert in drone warfare after three years of war with Russia in which the use of UAVs as a weapon of war became commonplace, also lent Denmark its anti-drone expertise. Security and defense will be central to talks at the informal European Council meeting on Wednesday, with how to strengthen Europe's common defense the central theme of the meeting. \"EU leaders will discuss how to strengthen Europe's defence, also in the light of Russia's recent airspace violations in several EU member states,\" the European Council said in a statement. Such \"provocations,\" it said, demonstrated the need for the EU to \"accelerate and intensify efforts to build a Europe capable of responding effectively, autonomously and together to common threats.\"\n\nBAKHMUT, UKRAINE - OCTOBER 29: A Ukrainian military man corrects a missile hit through a drone, as the Military special unit \"Kurt & Company group\" armed with homemade mini-MLRS fires at Russian positions on the frontline of the Russian Ukrainian war, on October 29, 2023 in Bakhmut District, Ukraine.

Over the summer, Ukraine regained territory north and south of Bakhmut but Russia has held the city itself. (Kostya Liberov /Libkos via Getty Images) Libkos | Getty Images News | Getty Images",

      "content": "Attorneys general from five states sued Zillow and Redfin on Wednesday, alleging the companies schemed to stop competition in the online housing rental market.\n\nThe lawsuit follows a similar one filed by the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials from New York, Arizona, Connecticut, Washington and Virginia jointly filed the lawsuit Wednesday, citing a February deal between the two companies in which Zillow \"paid Redfin $100 million to shut down its apartment rental advertising business and transfer its clients to Zillow,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James' office said in a news release.\n\n\"This agreement is nothing more than an end run around competition that insulates Zillow from head-to-head competition on the merits with Redfin for customers advertising multifamily buildings,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe suit alleges that the agreements violate federal antitrust laws and may harm renters using the companies' resources. It also claims that Redfin fired hundreds of employees and then worked with Zillow to rehire some of them.\n\n\"Millions of New Yorkers rely on online apartment listings to find an affordable and safe place to live,\" James said in a statement. \"Zillow's attempt to shut down its competition could drive up costs for advertisers and leave renters with fewer options when searching for a new apartment.\"\n\nZillow, Redfin and CoStar, which owns Apartments.com, are the three largest players in the market and account for 85% of all market revenue, according to James' office.\n\nThe AGs are seeking an injunction to bar the two companies from allegedly scheming and proposes a possible restructuring of the businesses to maintain competition.\n\n\"Redfin strongly disagrees with the allegations and is confident we will be vindicated by a court of law,\" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. \"Our partnership with Zillow has given Redfin.com visitors access to more rental listings and our advertising customers access to more renters. By the end of 2024, it was clear that the existing number of Redfin advertising customers couldn't justify the cost of maintaining our rentals sales force. Partnering with Zillow cut those costs and enabled us to invest more in rental-search innovations on Redfin.com, directly benefiting apartment seekers.\"\n\nA Zillow spokesperson said the company maintains that its partnership with Redfin is \"pro-competitive and pro-consumer by connecting property managers to more high-intent renters so they can fill their vacancies and more renters can get home.\"\n\nShares of Zillow and Redfin's parent company Rocket Companies initially traded lower following the announcement, after each losing ground on Tuesday following the FTC's lawsuit.\n\nThe FTC's complaint cites a similar alleged scheme between the two companies. Zillow and Redfin both disagreed with those allegations and said they remained confident in their partnership.",

      "description": "The firm says its secret to success is providing a \"white glove approach\" to all clients, regardless of who they are or how much they have invested.",
      "content": "John and Ruth Mullen. Courtesy: John Mullen\n\nJohn Mullen, president and CEO of Parsons Capital Management — which ranked No. 1 on CNBC's list of the top 100 financial advisors in the U.S. for 2025 — is well-versed in the struggle for equal treatment. Mullen said his first exposure to financial advising was through his mother, Ruth, who forged a career in the field, long dominated by men. Even today, women make up less than 25% of all certified financial planners, according to a report by the CFP Board. The two teamed up early on, and they still work together, now at Parsons Capital Management's office in Providence, Rhode Island, where both hold the title of managing director. Helping clients 'divorce emotions from investment decisions' Parsons Capital Management is committed to treating its clients equally, as well, regardless of their financial standing, according to John Mullen. \"Whether you have $1 million or $20 million with us, we strive to provide the same experience, and that approach has really resonated with people,\" he said.\n\nThe goal is \"to be a family office for those that don't have enough assets to have a family office,\" Mullen said — and \"clients appreciate that white glove approach.\" In a year marked by inflation, tariffs and the Federal Reserve's shifting monetary policy, that personalized care and close attention also helps clients \"divorce emotions from investment decisions,\" he said. \"In heavy news environments, like we've been in over the past year, we find that more client outreach takes on a heightened importance,\" Mullen said. \"Helping our clients to parse through the steady flow of news they may be consuming not only keeps them informed but can help to take the temperature down.\"\n\nThe firm, founded in 1993 by brothers Bob and Ged Parsons, maintains a collaborative attitude to sharing stock ideas, although each of the nearly one dozen managers \"is encouraged and empowered to make decisions for their clients,\" John Mullen said. \"It's not based on some model or investment committee, and I think that has served us well over time.\" This year, amid heightened volatility and periods of political and financial uncertainty, \"corporate fundamentals stayed strong while underlying economic indicators held,\" Mullen said, \"which gave us confidence that the downside could be contained.\" Ditching the 'old boys club' \"Another shared value for us is if you truly put the client's interest first, everything else follows — that builds loyalty,\" Ruth Mullen said. The result of that practice is that clients receive individual attention and advice, something that is highly valued in today's crowded field of investment professionals and robo-advisors.\n\nwatch now",

      "content": "A sign is displayed outside the El Capitan Entertainment Centre in Hollywood where the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show will be recorded on the first night the show will return to the ABC lineup on September 23, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nLate-night television has come under fire in recent months. That could leave advertisers and media companies, already clinging to what's left on live TV, with an even smaller pool of options.\n\nThe recent upheaval in late-night programming — namely the cancellation of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and the temporary suspension of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" — has shown a spotlight on ratings and revenue for late-night standouts and spurred questions of political influence.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, aggressively vocal about both Colbert's and Kimmel's bad fortune, has called for late-night shows on NBC hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers to be next on the chopping block.\n\nThe result is not just uncertainty for viewers, TV executives and show staffs, but a pall over an advertising category that's long been a staple of live TV.\n\n\"Reaching a lot of people who are engaged because it's live TV — or live-to-tape — is really important, and when you think about it from the media company's perspective ... the live moments are live sports on most given nights, the nightly news and late-night talk shows. That's all you have,\" said Kevin Krim, CEO of ad data firm EDO.\n\n\"To the people who think late night doesn't matter, they're not thinking about the economics and the goals and the incentives of both the advertisers and the media companies. They're ignoring some of the strategic value of the ecosystem,\" he added.\n\nWhen Disney's ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" off the air in September, it was unclear for days if or when the program would return. While Disney reinstated Kimmel less than a week later, more than 20% of the country still couldn't watch the show for three additional days as two major broadcast station owners preempted the content.\n\nColbert's show will end next year after CBS parent Paramount announced in July it wouldn't renew the program, citing financial considerations. The company has yet to reveal plans to fill the timeslot or give it back to the affiliate network owner.\n\nThe fervor around Colbert's upcoming cancellation caused a temporary ratings surge, and Kimmel's suspension led the show to rake in millions of viewers upon its return — way above the average and a missed opportunity for advertisers in the markets where Kimmel was preempted.",

      "content": "A new BlackRock deal could wisely position the asset manager to capitalize on surging demand for power as the generative AI boom shows no signs of slowing down. The news Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the infrastructure fund manager purchased by BlackRock, is nearing a $38 billion deal to acquire renewable power company AES , according to the Financial Times . If this were to happen, it would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers in history. AES, a prominent utility in the U.S., owns and operates power plants across the globe. The firm has provided energy solutions for the world's largest tech companies, including Club holdings Amazon , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms , as each of them increases their artificial intelligence spending and looks to build more power-hungry data centers. The FT reported that takeover talks are in advanced stages, but a BlackRock-AES deal could still fall through. A GIP spokesperson denied CNBC's request for comment. Shares of AES surged more than 15% on Wednesday, making up for lackluster year-to-year trading. Club stock BlackRock fell 2% amid broader weakness in financials as the overall stock market weighed the implications of the government shutdown and September's much weaker-than-expected ADP report on hiring at U.S. companies. Still, BlackRock was just under 3% off Tuesday's record-high close of $1,175. The stock has increased about 11% in 2025, which slightly trails the S & P 500' s 13% advance. Big picture The FT report comes roughly a year after BlackRock completed its acquisition of GIP for $12.5 billion, which added $100 billion in client assets to BlackRock's existing $50 billion in client infrastructure assets under management. GIP's major investments include London's Gatwick Airport, major energy pipelines, and more than 40 data centers, BlackRock said in March. GIP was one of several acquisitions that have given BlackRock more exposure to private markets. Since the start of 2024, BlackRock has acquired private credit manager HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion and alternatives data provider Preqin for $3.2 billion. In fact, CEO Larry Fink previously forecasted that infrastructure would be one of the fastest-growing segments of private markets. He cited, in part, the data center buildout. \"We're standing at the edge of an opportunity so vast it's almost hard to grasp. By 2040, the global demand for new infrastructure investment is $68 trillion,\" Fink said in his 2025 annual letter to investors. \"To put that price tag in perspective, it's roughly the equivalent of building the entire Interstate Highway System and the Transcontinental Railroad, start to finish, every six weeks—for the next 15 years.\" Bottom line BlackRock would stand to benefit from an AES acquisition because it would expand the asset manager's reach in high-growth infrastructure. Increased AI infrastructure spending by Big Tech, such as energy-intensive data centers, has been a financial windfall for companies able to help meet surging power demand. Just look at fellow Club holding GE Vernova stock, which manufactures heavy-duty gas turbines that support these facilities. The industrial stock has gained 83% year-to-date. To be sure, we're by no means saying that BlackRock will turn into a data center play. Instead, the acquisition would diversify BlackRock's revenue streams further — so it could rely less on its traditional exchange-traded fund (ETF) business, which is massive. Plus, AES has been underperforming in 2025, as seen prior to Wednesday's session. That means it \"could be a great deal for GIP to snap it up,\" Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the CNBC Investing Club, said Wednesday. After all, he added, \"one of the strongest long-term themes in the market is power generation.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BLK, GEV, META, MSFT, AMZN.

The Financial Times reports that a new technical capability notice (TCN) was issued by the UK Home Office in early September, this time specifically targeting access to British citizens’ iCloud backups.\n\n“The UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a ‘back door’ that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties,” Gabbard posted to X on August 19th. While US officials raised concerns about the order during President Trump’s state visit to the UK last month, according to The Financial Times, the publication reports that two senior British government figures said the UK was no longer facing US pressure to drop its demands.\n\nWe have reached out to Apple for comment. The UK Home Office declined to comment on the situation.\n\nThe UK’s revived attempt to bypass Apple’s data encryption has sparked concerns that security and privacy may still be impacted for users worldwide. “If Apple breaks end-to-end encryption for the UK, it breaks it for everyone,” said Privacy International, a non-profit privacy watchdog. “The resulting vulnerability can be exploited by hostile states, criminals and other bad actors the world over.”",

      "content": "is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWhen Microsoft first launched its Copilot Pro plan last year and wanted an extra $20 a month on top of a Microsoft 365 Family or Personal subscription to get AI-powered Office features, it seemed like a tall ask. After bundling Office AI features into Microsoft 365 subscriptions earlier this year, Microsoft is now taking the next step of merging Copilot Pro and Microsoft 365 into a new Microsoft 365 Premium subscription.\n\n“It’s really going to be our most powerful AI and productivity subscription for any individual,” says Gareth Oystryk, senior director of marketing for Copilot Pro and Microsoft 365, in an interview with The Verge. “It brings together our trusted collection of productivity apps with Copilot built-in, along with our highest Copilot usage limits and exclusive features.”\n\nMicrosoft 365 Premium will be priced at $19.99 per month, the same price as OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus subscription, and will include Microsoft’s highest usage limits in features like GPT-4o image generation and voice, as well as Copilot Podcasts, Deep Research, Vision, and Actions. It will also include all of the Microsoft 365 Family benefits, with access to Office desktop apps for six people, 1TB of storage per person, and more.\n\n“We created this subscription really for any solopreneur, professional, or high achiever looking to tackle the most demanding productivity tasks with AI at their side,” Oystryk says. “When you look at the value you get with this plan at this price point, and you stack that against the competition, you’re going to find that the value is pretty undeniable.”\n\nThat competition is clearly ChatGPT Plus. OpenAI markets ChatGPT Plus as a productivity subscription, with extended access to GPT-5 and higher limits on messaging, file uploads, data analysis, and image generation. Microsoft 365 Premium has the added benefit of access to Office desktop apps with Copilot features built straight into them, as well as 1TB of cloud storage per person.\n\nAs Sumit Chauhan, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Office Product Group, told me earlier this week: “Productivity is our DNA, we’re Office. While others will try to replicate us, there is no substitute for the real thing.”\n\nMicrosoft is also opening up access to its Researcher and Analyst reasoning agents to Microsoft 365 Premium, and they’ll both be available in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel apps soon.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing part of Microsoft’s 365 Premium launch is how it and Microsoft’s existing Family and Personal subscriptions will now allow consumers to enable Microsoft’s AI features in their Office apps at work. “We have seen a lot of employees, all over the place, bringing their own AI to work,” Oystryk says. “With Microsoft 365 Premium, along with Personal and Family, you can actually bring Copilot to work with you.”\n\nMicrosoft will now light up the Microsoft 365 Copilot features your workplace would normally have to pay a subscription for if you have your own Microsoft 365 Premium, Family, or Personal account. All you have to do is sign into your work version of Office with your personal Microsoft account, and it will enable the AI features inside your work Office apps.\n\nIt essentially enables the Microsoft 365 Copilot license, while maintaining all the usual security, compliance, and enterprise data protection features to ensure corporate data isn’t shared with your personal Microsoft account. “This capability works with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook on Windows PCs, Mac, iPad, and more,” Oystryk says. “It doesn’t work on the web… but in the apps that most people use you can sign in and apply that capability.” IT admins will be able to enable or disable the sign-in functionality, too.\n\nUnfortunately, Microsoft is still limiting the ability to unlock AI features in Office at work or at home to the main account holder for Microsoft 365 Family or Premium subscriptions. “We definitely have feedback from our customers to offer some kind of sharing, so we are evaluating some options there,” Oystryk says.\n\nExisting Personal and Family subscribers will also get GPT-4o image generation and voice access, with higher usage limits than the free Copilot tier. Copilot Chat, which was previously only available for Microsoft 365 commercial customers, is also coming to all consumer subscriptions.\n\nAll of these changes effectively mean the end of Copilot Pro, which remained in place for power users to get priority access to the latest AI models and higher usage limits after Microsoft bundled Office AI features with Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions earlier this year.\n\n“Copilot Pro is not entirely going away, but we will stop selling it,” Oystryk admits. “We’re not automatically opting-in Copilot Pro subscribers to Microsoft 365 Premium. We have no timing yet of if and when we’ll discontinue it.”",

The icons have a modern design that’s more colorful and playful, with subtle changes that match Microsoft’s recent work with its Fluent illustrations.\n\nAll of Microsoft’s 10 core Office icons are being refreshed, with a design that was inspired by Microsoft’s work on the Copilot icon. This is the first major change to the Office icons since their overhaul in 2018, and it’s meant to represent a more connected design system and Copilot’s influence on Microsoft 365.\n\nThe new Microsoft 365 icons. Image: Microsoft\n\n“The core 10 Office apps were last updated in 2018 and the way we described what the designs represented is almost identical to language used today: connection, coherence, seamless collaboration, fluid transitions,” explains Jon Friedman, corporate vice president of design and research for Microsoft 365. “The new icons emanate a sense of fluidity and play, while also being simpler, more intuitive, and highly accessible.”\n\nMuch like Google’s new logo, Microsoft has picked gradients of color for its Office icons. “Where gradients were once subtle, they’re now richer and more vibrant, featuring exaggerated analogous transitions that improve contrast and accessibility,” Friedman says.\n\nThe evolution of Microsoft’s Office icons. Image: Microsoft\n\nThe new icons are also a little more simplified, with the Word icon previously using four horizontal bars and now using three, to improve legibility at smaller sizes. “We’ve moved away from bold, static solidity to embrace softer, more fluid forms,” Friedman explains. “Sharp edges and crisp lines are replaced by smooth folds and curves, giving the icons a sense of playful motion and approachability.”\n\nThe new icons will start rolling out in the coming weeks across web, desktop, and mobile for both consumers and commercial users of Microsoft 365.",

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nFord and GM have apparently worked up an interesting scheme to keep the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit from driving down sales. According to Reuters, the automakers are working with dealers on short-term programs that would allow customers to continue to receive the tax credit on leased EVs through the rest of the year.\n\nThe programs will operate under each automaker’s financing arm, according to documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with dealers briefed on the plan. It basically works like this: Ford and GM will buy EVs from its own dealers by having their finance divisions put down payments on all the electric models in their inventory before the tax credit expires. The dealers will then lease the vehicles to customers with a $7,500 discount baked into the price.\n\nWoburn, MA - September 12: A salesman at Colonial Cadillac of Woburn assists a customer with an electric car on September 12, 2025. (Photo by Suzanne Kreiter/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\n“The old adage, of ‘if you’re not cheating you’re not trying’ comes to mind,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com, “but, gotta give GM and Ford credit for taking advantage of the tax loophole and pushing it to the next level with a bit of creativity more so than actual cheating.”\n\nThe automakers are hoping to soften the blow on car shoppers and keep up the momentum that many dealers have been seeing in recent weeks. EV sales spiked in July and August as shoppers rushed to claim the credit before it expired on September 30th. Experts predict that once the credit vanishes, EV sales will plummet.\n\n“Ford is working to provide Ford electric vehicle shoppers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until December 31st,” Dan Barbossa, a spokesperson for the company, said in an email. (A spokesperson for GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nFord and GM reviewed the new programs with officials from the Internal Revenue Service before putting it into action, Reuters says citing three sources. In August, the IRS said vehicles must be purchased by September 30th to qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.\n\nThis check-in with the IRS “lowers the risk of it being shut down,” said Paul Waati, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. “Still, nothing is ever fully settled until formal guidance is issued, and regulators could ultimately decide this stretches beyond the intent of the law.”\n\nIneed, there are some risks involved. Ford and GM will take a financial hit on any unsold EVs. And it’s unclear whether either automaker plans on extending the discount program on leased EVs through the end of the year. Ford’s F-150 Lightning was the only EV in its lineup eligible for the tax credit (the Mustang Mach-E did not meet the battery requirements). GM had several eligible EVs, including the Chevy Equinox, Blazer, and Silverado, as well as the Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq, and Vistiq, and the GMC Sierra EV.\n\nBut as Drury notes, throughout this entire year EV leasing at dealerships has hovered around two third of all sales or above, as virtually every automaker leans into leasing to take advantage of the tax credit for their slower selling EVs.\n\n“It clearly has resonated with consumers as leasing is the preferred method of purchase if you’re trying out a new technology for the first time, want the lowest monthly payment or are trying to dodge the resale value issue,” he added. “GM and Ford’s workaround will certainly lessen the gut punch that some other automakers will suffer once the credit is no longer available, but they’re also kicking the can down the road till 2026.”",

      "content": "is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThanks to a deal struck by Zillow and Redfin in February, renters have had fewer options for browsing apartment listings, and they might not have even realized it. Now the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing the companies, alleging that their partnership violates antitrust laws and calling it “an illegal agreement to dismantle Redfin as a competitor.”\n\nZillow (which runs Trulia, HotPads, and StreetEasy) entered into a partnership in which it paid Redfin (which runs Rent.com and ApartmentGuide) to syndicate its ads for rentals. That means whether you were going to Zillow, Trulia, or Rent.com, you were seeing many of the exact same listings.\n\nAs part of that deal, Redfin also agreed to end its existing contracts with advertising customers, transfer them to Zillow, and, according to the FTC complaint, not compete with Zillow for multifamily property listings for up to nine years. In a press release announcing the lawsuit the FTC’s Director of the Bureau of Competition said that “paying off a competitor to stop competing against you is a violation of federal antitrust laws.”\n\nThe FTC further alleges that as part of this deal Redfin laid off hundreds of workers, then helped Zillow cherry-pick the ones it wanted. Effectively, it sounds like the FTC is accusing Zillow of acquiring part of Redfin’s business, but hiding behind the guise of a “partnership” to try and avoid regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBetween its own listing sites, Redfin’s, and Realtor.com (which Zillow entered a partnership with in 2024), Zillow effectively controls the vast majority of rental listings online when it comes to larger apartment complexes. This could drive up costs for landlords looking to list their apartments on these sites and make it harder for renters to find properties outside of Zillow’s network of advertisers. Zillow had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.",

      "content": "is a commerce reporter for The Verge writing about the best deals and gadgets. He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.\n\nFew gadgets are as personal as a smartwatch, which you literally wear on your wrist all day (and potentially while you sleep). Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 is one of the best Android smartwatches we’ve tested, and you can pick up a 40mm Bluetooth model for $158.99 ($90 off) at Amazon. Verge Senior Reviewer Victoria Song found a lot to like about the Galaxy Watch 7 during her tests, including its comfortable design and the overall snappiness of its chip.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7 $ 159 $ 300 47 % off $ 159 The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 comes in two sizes: 40mm and 44mm. It comes with new features like FDA-cleared sleep detection features as well as irregular heart rate notifications. Read More $159 at Amazon\n\nIts circular shape will please you if you’re coming from a traditional watch, or aren’t a fan of the squircle design Samsung decided on for the Galaxy Watch 8. We found its battery lasted about a day, which is okay, but be prepared to charge your smartwatch every night. The Galaxy Watch 7’s sensors can record the typical litany of health and wellness metrics, from the number of steps you’ve taken to your sleep and heart rate. The Galaxy Watch 7 has an FDA-cleared sleep apnea feature, but it relies on Samsung Health Monitor app, which is exclusive to Samsung’s smartphones.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 7 supports two AI-powered wellness features called Energy Score and Wellness Tips. Both take information collected about your activity and sleep to offer advice about tweaks you may want to make to your routine to help hit your goals. You can also use the smartwatch to compare how well you did on your exercises today compared to yesterday to encourage you to hit a new personal best.\n\nIn our tests, these features were hit or miss. Our Energy Score fell dramatically after a long run, and bounced back after nine hours of sleep, but recommended we stop drinking alcohol or eating late at night despite not doing either of those things. We received Wellness Tips informing us we were and were not sticking to our sleep schedule on the same day.\n\nAll that said, we found the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 to be a solid Android smartwatch based on its design and overall performance. It’s a solid upgrade over previous generations, and even more competitive with other Android smartwatches if you have a Galaxy smartphone and can take advantage of its sleep apnea detection.\n\nThree more great deals\n\nSteam’s autumn sale is live, so you can fill up your backlog even further without breaking the bank. Blue Prince is one of the best games we played in 2025, and it’s $22.49 ($7.50 off). You can grab Hades for $6.24 ($18.71 off) if you want to play the first game before hopping into the sequel . I’m a massive fan of role playing games, and highly recommend picking up Octopath Traveler while it’s $23.99 ($36 off) if it slipped through the cracks. The Chrono Trigger-inspired Sea of Stars is another one of my favorites, and it’s down to $22.74 ($12.25 off) right now.\n\nIf you prefer physical books to digital ones, you know how frustrating it is to strain your eyes reading in a dark room. Glocusent’s USB Rechargeable Book Light can solve that problem and it’s on sale for $10.98 ($5 off) at Amazon . The light clips onto the cover of your book, and its articulating pieces let you change its angle to illuminate one or two pages. The light has five brightness levels and three reading modes, which adjusts the color temperature of its bulb. Glocusent says its book light lasts up to 80 hours per charge depending on your preferred brightness setting.\n\nEufy’s Robot Vacuum E28 can handle that chore for you, and the robot vacuum and mop combo is back down to $799.99 ($600 off) its lowest price ever at WS24T2352111.

      "content": "is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe Porsche Cayenne Electric won’t make its official debut until later this year. But in the meantime, the sports car maker is offering a hint of what’s to come with a detailed look at the new EV’s interior, including a curved OLED display that I think I can safely say is unique in the automotive world today.\n\nPorsche is calling it the Flow Display, a vertically installed screen that curves toward the bottom. It is both the largest screen ever to be featured in a Porsche and also the most unique. It will run on Porsche’s all new operating system, which the automaker claims will “flow” harmoniously throughout the vehicle’s interior.\n\nYou can see how the screen functions move up and down the curved display in this TikTok from Autogefüehl.\n\n“Our goal was to combine quintessential Cayenne characteristics and the newly developed display surfaces with the features of the new ‘Porsche Digital Interaction’ into a harmonious overall package,” Markus Auerbach, director of interior design at Style Porsche, said in a press release. “One that’s innovative, forward-thinking and meticulously thought through down to the finest detail.”\n\nPorsche isn’t revealing the measurements of the screen, most likely because the bend makes it difficult. (Electrek says it spans nearly 42 inches.) But the new Cayenne will also have a 14.25-inch instrument cluster, a heads-up display, and an optional 14.9-inch passenger screen for video streaming and app control functions.\n\nImage: Porsche\n\nIn some sense, we knew this was coming. As far back as 2023, Porsche’s chair of the executive board, Oliver Blume (who also serves as Volkswagen Group’s CEO), was promising a “completely new experience” in the interior of the sports car maker’s new EV lineup. Porsche is now delivering on that promise, while also striking a new one: the wholesale “reinvention” of the interior experience. (As my colleague Marina Galperina rightfully asks, why must everything be an “experience” these days? Other automakers are also guilty of overusing this term.)\n\nTo be sure, Porsche had to go big with the Cayenne. The all-new Macan crossover EV has been a big winner, despite Porsche logging an overall drop in sales in the first half of the year. But while its gas car sales have dropped, its EV and plug-in hybrid vehicles have been on a winning streak, up 14.5 percent in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nImage: Porsche\n\nThe new Flow Display could certainly give the new Cayenne a boost when it goes on sale next year. But it could also make it a tough sell with anyone experiencing screen fatigue, who maybe desire more buttons and tactile controls. Surveys routinely show that car shoppers are over the Tesla-inspired minimalism of the modern interior and are ready to bring back physical buttons.\n\nPorsche claims the new Cayenne prioritizes driver engagement with a new AI-powered voice assistant, as well as a compliment of physical buttons for HVAC, volume control, and window defroster. The voice assistant can “reliably” understand complex instructions and spontaneous follow-up questions without repeating the activation word. The voice assistant controls climate, seat heating, and ambient lighting, while also recognizing addresses, points of interest, and traffic information.\n\nConsidering Porsche is on tap to receive Apple’s newly immersive CarPlay Ultra, one wonders how phone mirroring will work with this massive curved display. The current iteration of CarPlay seems to work fine on the Flow Display, as shown in Autogefüehl’s TikTok. We’ll have to wait and see how its more deeply integrated successor does with the bend.\n\nPorsche joins Mercedes-Benz and BMW in trying to reinvent the interior experience in order to better compete with the influx of high-tech Chinese EVs. Other brands, like Sony and Honda’s Afeela, are putting media, video streaming, and gaming at the center of their marketing pitch to customers, which is in anticipation of autonomous driving eventually making the need to pay attention to the road obsolete.",

      "description": "Waymo's permit to test autonomous vehicles in New York City has been extended to the end of the year, giving the company a few more months to make it big in the Big Apple.",
      "content": "New York City regulators have extended Waymo’s autonomous vehicle testing permit through the end of the year, the company said Wednesday.\n\nThe permit was initially granted in August to allow Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city until the end of September. The terms of the extended permit are the same: Waymo can deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel. A spokesperson for Waymo said the permit makes the company’s drivers exempt from New York’s rules mandating they keep one hand on the wheel at all times.\n\nWaymo’s permit extension signals that it is inching towards being the first AV company to launch a robotaxi service on the chaotic and dense streets of NYC. The company currently operates a commercial service in San Francisco, Austin, Atlanta, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and plans to open to the public in Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Denver, and Nashville within the next year.\n\n“As sponsor of legislation on autonomous vehicles at the state level, I’m encouraged to see New York City moving forward with testing that will show us how this technology can improve safety, reduce congestion, and expand mobility,” Assemblymember Brian Cunningham said in a statement. “This is the type of measured innovation that allows us to prepare for the future while making sure progress works for New Yorkers.”\n\nStill, Waymo has a long way to go in NYC — a city where the Alphabet-owned company has been trying to operate since 2021. Even with this permit, Waymo cannot carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. A Waymo spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is in talks to apply for those licenses. TechCrunch has reached out to the TLC to learn more about requirements for AV companies.\n\nAnother hurdle is that there is no permitting structure in New York that allows Waymo or any other AV company to test or deploy robotaxis without a human safety driver. While legislation has been introduced to create a framework for driverless operation, nothing has been passed into law yet.",

      "content": "Last month, Gusto, a payroll and HR software company, announced that it agreed to acquire Guideline, a startup offering retirement plans to small and medium businesses.\n\nThe terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but Gusto paid approximately $600 million, according to a source familiar with the deal, although TechCrunch could not confirm how much of this was cash and how much was stock.\n\nGuideline was last valued at $1.15 billion in 2021 when it raised a $200 million Series D funding round. Since its founding in 2015, it has raised a total of $340 million. While the acquisition price is below the startup’s private valuation, the company’s early-stage investors, including Felicis, Tiger Global, and NEA, will likely realize a return. General Atlantic, which led the company’s Series D, is expected to earn a small profit on its investment, too, sources say.\n\nFounded by former TaskRabbit co-founder Kevin Busque (pictured above), Guideline helps small and medium-sized businesses easily set up and manage 401(k) plans. It charges a flat, per-employee fee instead of the traditional model of charging a percentage of assets under management. CNBC reported that Guideline’s annualized recurring revenue (ARR), a metric that measures predictable yearly income from subscriptions, was $140 million as of this past January.\n\nGusto, which was founded in 2011 and is valued at $9.3 billion, has been offering 401(k) retirement plans to its customers through a partnership with Guideline since 2015. But Guideline’s relationship with Gusto isn’t exclusive. Customers can also set up Guideline retirement plans through other payroll providers like ADP, Intuit, Paylocity, TriNet, and Rippling.\n\nAccording to three sources familiar with the transaction, Gusto is looking to sell off Guideline’s accounts associated with rival payroll companies. The proceeds from those sales will be shared among Gusto and Guideline shareholders, said one person familiar with the deal, potentially increasing returns for investors even more.\n\nGusto declined to comment on the deal price and its divestment plans.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The company has been profitable for over a year, the company’s spokesperson confirmed. However, it faces plenty of competition, such as from Human Interest, its closest rival, which is backed by SoftBank and Baillie Gifford. Human Interest grew 70% last year and is expected to be profitable by the end of the year, the company’s co-founder and CEO Jeff Schneble told TechCrunch.

      "content": "Iman Clark, CEO of Prickly Pear Health, says she had an epiphany that eventually led her to TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\n\nIt was around nine years ago. She moved from Tunisia to the U.S. for grad school, then joined a company that created gamified experiences for people with neurodegenerative conditions, like dementia. This was done by giving them a tablet or a computer and letting them play games while doctors collected data on them, like their risk of falling and overall range of motion.\n\n“I realized that most people, 75-plus, have two to three chronic conditions, and no matter what we did, it is always going to be hard,” she told TechCrunch. “Then I went back to the research and saw that like, 70% of the Alzheimer’s population are women.”\n\nShe dug deeper and found that women were twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and three to four times more likely to be diagnosed with migraines. “That’s when I realized we are not really solving for women’s biology, and that is costing us lives and dollars.”\n\nSo she created Prickly Pear Health, which provides medical support for women’s brain health, a voice-first, AI-powered companion that helps women in their 30s to 50s navigate the hormonal changes that affect brain health. The product lets people record quick reflections throughout the day using their voice and Prickly Pear’s AI technology analyzes their language and context to track any cognitive changes.\n\nPrickly Pear Health will show of its tech at TechCrunch Disrupt, which runs October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.\n\nIt also pulls in sleep data, heart rate activity, and other metrics from trackers like Apple Health, Oura, and Garmin to help offer personalized insights on how they can take better care of their health.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nClark said there is a collective agreement that women’s health is a space ripe for innovation, and that women want to be founders, want to be top voices, and are tired of being in the back seats of their own lives.\n\nClark officially launched a free version of her product in May and is gearing up to launch the premium offering in October, for Mental Health Awareness Month and Menopause Awareness Month.\n\nShe started doing focus groups at Arizona State University and found that women in their late 30s to early 50s were reporting a lot of brain fog and mental fatigue, but it often took them until their 60s to realize it had to do with hormonal fluctuations, menopause, or even an onset of something deeper. It was here that Clark realized she wanted to focus on this age range.\n\n“They’re often dismissed or misdiagnosed when symptoms like brain fog, mood shifts, or irregular cycles first appear,” she said of women in their 30s to 50s, adding that these midlife years are critical to brain health, but traditional care is failing to connect the dots.\n\n“We’re addressing that gap. Helping women recognize and act on early signals before they escalate into more serious health challenges later,” she said.\n\nArizona is also where the inspiration for the company’s name came from. She became fascinated with the cacti, how they stand despite the heat and produce healthy fruit. “That’s when Prickly Pear came to life because that’s the fruit that grows in the cactus tree, and it was an inspiration of thriving in harsh conditions and joyful resilience,” she said.\n\nShe considers competitors in her same field to be existing menopause apps, which, she said, are more like symptom trackers. “We believe it’s important to understand symptoms, but we believe that those approaches are reactive approaches, while for us, we are there to be able to detect things.”\n\nShe raised a $350,000 pre-seed round and said it was “really hard,” especially as a woman of color. “We had to be so good that you cannot be ignored,” she said. She sought to build relationships with investors before starting her pre-seed, which, she said, really helped when it came time for the ask. “That’s a popular thing we say: ‘Ask for advice and you get business, ask for business and you get advice sometimes,’” she said.\n\nSome advice she received was to apply for Startup Battlefield, with friends telling her to be loud and proud about being part of the latest startups to pitch during the competition.\n\n“Disrupt is the ultimate stage for new ideas,” she said. She’s excited to spotlight women’s brain health, learn from other founders, and, of course, “connect with investors and partners who believe, like we do, that women’s health innovation is not niche, it’s the future of healthcare.”\n\nIf you want to learn from Prickly Pear firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.",

      "description": "A startup called Deta is releasing a new app called Surf, which is a remix of an AI browser and NotebookLM.",
      "content": "We have reached a place in the AI lifecycle where we’re seeing a lot of “X meets Y” applications. Multiple companies are already releasing “AI meets TikTok” apps, for instance. Now, Berlin- and New York-based startup Deta is marrying AI browsers and something like Google’s NotebookLM in a new knowledge management app called Surf.\n\nDeta Surf, which is launching in beta today, is both a browser and a research tool that allows you to create notebooks on different topics. You can use AI to get a gist of a certain topic based on your prompt. You’ll then get a summary report on a topic in a Notion-styled document, which you can edit.\n\nSince the core application is a browser, you can open URLs and surf the web. While browsing, you can summarize and extract key insights from web pages, PDFs, and YouTube videos.\n\nUsers can mention multiple tabs to the AI chatbot, using them as context, and ask questions around them. Additionally, Deta Surf can generate code, so you can ask the tool to create mini apps, interactive graphs, or charts for your notebook. You can also add any of the output from AI to a particular notebook.\n\nMost modern-day AI-browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, The Browser Company’s Dia, and Opera Neon allow users to use tabs as context. And a few of them also have the ability to generate small snippets of code.\n\nDeta, which was founded in 2019, set out to build a new operating system using an infinite white canvas. However, the company sunset the product in 2023, and started working on an AI browser.\n\nThe company’s co-founder, Max Eusterbrock, said that the company explored different interfaces for a browser, but realized that pursuing this direction was a bad idea.\n\n“We were in Alpha for a year. During that time, we realized that AI browsers are landing in the spot where they are fundamentally becoming tools for machines to click around and navigate hypertext that is meant for humans,” he said.\n\nImage Credits:Deta.Surf\n\nEusterbrock added that the startup also thinks that an interface where you can’t edit anything is not a great design for human-machine interaction.\n\nWhile the product functions much like a browser, the startup thinks NotebookLM is a direct competitor. Eusterbrock believes that because Surf provides you with context with tabs and keeps the data locally to let you work offline on the notebooks, it’s a better-suited product for students and researchers.\n\nThe company has made the tool available for free and is working on an image generation feature. Going forward, it may work toward a premium subscription that would include features like cloud backup, collaboration, and multi-device clients.\n\nIn 2023, Deta raised $3.6 million in a seed round led by Crane Venture Partners with participation from System.One, Tomahawk.VC, Tiny.VC, Acequia Capital, Angel Invest, and NPHard. Since then, the company has raised an additional $500,000 in funding from existing and new investors.",

      "description": "Simple is an AI-powered health coaching app that helps people lose weight.",
      "content": "Mike Prytkov said he knows what it’s like to let stress take over one’s life.\n\nWhile building his first company, he said he worked long hours and gained weight. After exiting his company (an adtech company called Appness), he said he tried many things to lose the pounds: extreme workouts, calorie tracking, and fasting. “While it worked, consistency was the hard part,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nWhat he really wanted was a coach who would keep him accountable, he said. So in 2019, he launched Simple, an AI-powered health coaching app that helps people lose weight. Then, in 2023, he added its standout feature: an AI coach named Avo, which helps give tailored advice to users’ needs and progress.\n\n“We wanted to help people lose weight without the guilt or grind that is innate to the toxic diet culture,” he said.\n\nHaving built the company to a current $160 million in ARR with 700,000 subscribers, he said, Simple announced on Wednesday that it closed a $35 million Series B funding round led by actor Kevin Hart’s HartBeat Ventures. The company has raised $45 million in total funding.\n\nPrytkov had an early co-founder who has since left the company, leaving him at the helm solo.\n\nAvo today handles more than 100,000 coaching conversations a day and processes nearly 300,000 daily meal logs, Prytkov said. Users fill out a form to help them build a personalized program, then they are introduced to the AI coach. It collects information, like meal logs, from user input, and it runs assessments that score habits and nutritional quality, he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

And it competes with WeightWatchers and MyFitnessPal. Prytkov said it is different from its competitors because it does not offer generic lessons or generally track calories, nor has it ventured into supplying GLP-1 medications.\n\n“We provide personalized coaching, not just tracking,” he said. “Avo adapts daily plans across nutrition, fasting, movement, and habits, as it provides real-time meal feedback and tailored check-ins.”\n\nIt does, however, help complement GLP-1 users and their medication, acting as a “behavior engine” that helps sustain routines after the meds stop.\n\nAlthough the coaching premise of the app has remained unchanged, the rise of LLMs has been a boon to personalization. “AI has changed both the product and the model,” he continued.\n\n“Every dialogue, every logged meal feeds a closed‑loop learning system that updates each person’s profile and improves our cohort‑level models,” he said. “With each iteration, Avo becomes more accurate and more proactive.”\n\nPrytkov said that HartBeat approached the company after it launched Avo two years ago. The firm already had a few health investments under its belt.\n\n“At the time, we weren’t looking for investors, but HartBeat Ventures felt like an amazing fit for us, so we agreed,” he said, adding that the app already had the metrics, profitability, and traction. Others in the round include the private credit firm Liquidity.\n\nPrytkov believes users, meanwhile, have taken to the app because it doesn’t feel clinical to them. He said virtual wellness has become the “default front door” for weight management as it’s proven affordable and accessible. Next, he wants to expand his company’s GLP-1 companion features and also launch specialized women’s health and midlife programs.\n\nEventually, he plans to expand beyond weight loss and make a health app that can help with sleep, stress, and movement.\n\n“Our vision is to become the Duolingo of health,” Prytkov said. “The goal is simple. Become the go-to fun health companion people use every day, and the most effective way to build healthy habits.”",

At that time, the U.K. Home Office was seeking access to cloud-stored backups of any Apple user account worldwide that was protected by ADP.\n\nThat first order, made under the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Act 2016, also known by critics as the “Snoopers’ Charter,” forced Apple to turn off the ability to enroll in ADP for new users in the U.K. and eventually to disable it for existing users as well.\n\n“As we have said many times before, we have never built a back door or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” Apple said at the time.\n\nThat previous effort by the U.K. government apparently failed, when U.S. National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard announced that the British government had dropped the request after negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\nApple reportedly challenged the legal demand in court, which ruled that the process should not be held in secret.\n\nThis story has been updated to include comment from Apple’s spokesperson.",

      "description": "Spotify lets you take more control over your recommendations by excluding tracks from influencing your taste profile.",
      "content": "Spotify on Wednesday announced the launch of a new feature that allows users to take more control over their recommendations. The service will now let users exclude certain tracks from influencing their taste profile. This taste profile refers to streamer’s sense of your personal musical taste and interests, and it drives Spotify’s recommendations, including your Discovery Weekly, Home page selections, annual Wrapped experience, Blend playlists with friends, and more.\n\nThe company had previously provided a way for users to exclude certain playlists from their taste profile, but this didn’t solve the overall problem of having music you’re not really into influence Spotify’s recommendations. Rather, the playlist feature was more useful for things like making sure your sleep music didn’t lead to more new age or white noise suggestions.\n\nWith this new option, you can move through your recently played items to tell Spotify that there are some songs you were playing but don’t actually like. (Parents everywhere, rejoice!)\n\nTo use the feature, both free and premium users can tap the three dots on the top-right corner of their screen after selecting the song they want to exclude. Users can then choose to exclude the song from their taste profile or include a previously excluded song.\n\nSpotify’s hyperpersonalization has been a long-time key selling point for the service. But there are many scenarios where the ingestion of everything you listen to into algorithms doesn’t make sense. Families, particularly those with small children, immediately come to mind. Users also often share their Spotify account while in the car with friends and family, allowing others to take their turn at playing DJ. The growing number of smart speakers in the home has also led some members of the household to become the default Spotify account holder associated with everyone’s taste.\n\nGiven the wide range of scenarios, manually excluding tracks is a nice workaround, but it’s not the best solution. Ideally, users would be able to more easily switch between profiles, perhaps even by using voice commands, as you’re often listening while driving. Or the app could offer a way to tap to associate an entire listening session with one family member or the other, instead of forcing you to go through songs one by one.\n\nIn any event, the feature will at least offer some recourse for those who have longed to have their Spotify Wrapped not ruined by the kids’ music.",
