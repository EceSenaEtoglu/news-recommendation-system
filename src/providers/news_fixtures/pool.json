      "content": "US says 'framework' for TikTok ownership deal agreed with China\n\n6 minutes ago Share Save Jessica Rawnsley BBC News Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nThe US treasury secretary has said Washington reached a \"framework\" deal with China on the ownership of TikTok's American operations. Scott Bessent said the framework was set in trade talks in Madrid to pave the way for US ownership. He added that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would \"complete\" the deal on Friday. Trump said on Truth Social that the talks had \"gone very well\", while China confirmed a framework agreement but said no deal would be made at the expense of Chinese companies' interests. A deadline is looming for the Chinese owner of TikTok to find a buyer for its American operations or face a shutdown and ban in the US.\n\nBessent announced the \"framework\" deal on the second day of negotiations between the US and China aimed at ending a trade war. He said the threat to shut down the social media site in the US had persuaded Chinese negotiators to drop demands for reduced tariffs as part of any deal to sell TikTok's US arm. The agreed upon commercial terms would protect US national security interests, he added. US trade representative Jamieson Greer, part of the US delegation in Madrid, said the deal struck was \"subject to the leaders' approval\", but added his team was \"not... in the business of having repetitive [ban] extensions\". China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, said his country would not reach a deal with the US at the expense of its own principles and Chinese companies' interests. Its leadership would review any deal before it was agreed, he added.\n\nReuters Delegations led by US secretary of state Scott Bessent and Chinese vice premier He Lifeng have held four meetings since May in attempts to improve bilateral relations",

      "content": "Brazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffs\n\nThe Brazilian leader said he had written the essay to establish an open and frank dialogue with US President Donald Trump, who has imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.\n\nIn an opinion piece published in the New York Times , Lula dismissed the description by US President Donald Trump of the trial as a \"witch hunt\", saying that it was a \"historic decision which safeguard's our institutions and the democratic rule of law\".\n\nBrazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has defended the trial which saw his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, sentenced to more than 27 years in prison for plotting a coup.\n\nRelations have been tense between the US and Brazil in recent months, in stark contrast to the times when Trump's counterpart in Brazil was Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nBolsonaro often expressed his admiration for Trump, who hosted him at his Mar-a Lago resort in 2020.\n\nLula, a left-wing leader, who is known for his direct tone, did not mince his words in his New York Times editorial.\n\nHe said that over the past 15 years the US had \"accumulated a surplus of $410bn (£302bn) in bilateral trade in goods and services\", adding the decision to impose the tariffs could only be political.\n\n\"The US government is using tariffs and the Magnitsky Act to seek impunity for former President Jair Bolsonaro,\" Lula wrote, referring to the sanctions which the US has imposed on the Supreme Court justice who led the trial against Bolsonaro.\n\nThe trial concluded on Thursday when four out of the five Supreme Court justices on the panel tasked with judging Bolsonaro found him guilty of all five charges he was facing. A simple majority was needed to convict him.\n\nBolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and 3 months in prison - a sentence which his lawyers say they will appeal against.\n\nTrump said he found the verdict \"very surprising\" and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would \"respond accordingly to this witch hunt\".\n\nIn his New York Times article, Lula insisted the trial was \"not a 'witch hunt'\".\n\n\"The judgement was the result of proceedings carried out in accordance with Brazil's 1988 Constitution, enacted after two decades of struggle against a military dictatorship,\" he wrote, reminding readers that Brazil's democracy was restored in 1985 after 20 years of military rule.\n\nLula also dismissed the Trump administration's accusations that Brazil's justice system had targeted and censored US tech firms.\n\nThe Brazilian president said that his country's courts were right to regulate the internet and that US firms were not being treated unfairly.\n\nHe concluded his essay by addressing President Trump directly, telling his US counterpart that Brazil remains open to negotiating \"anything that can bring mutual benefits\", but warned Trump that \"Brazil's democracy and sovereignty are not on the table\".",

      "content": "Two men jailed for attempting to bewitch and kill Zambia's president\n\nZambia's President Hakainde Hichilema says he does not believe in witchcraft\n\nThe case has been closely followed in Zambia, as this was the first time anyone was put on trial for attempting to use witchcraft against a president.\n\n\"It is my considered view that the convicts were not only the enemy of the head of state but were also enemies of all Zambians,\" magistrate Fine Mayambu said in his ruling.\n\nZambian Leonard Phiri and Mozambican Jasten Mabulesse Candunde were convicted under the Witchcraft Act after being arrested in December with charms in their possession, including a live chameleon.\n\nA court in Zambia has sentenced two men to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hakainde Hichilema.\n\nDespite their insistence that they were bona fide traditional healers, the court found them guilty on two counts under the Witchcraft Act.\n\nThe prosecution alleged that Phiri and Candunde were hired by a fugitive former MP to bewitch Hichilema.\n\n\"The two accepted ownership of the charms. Phiri further demonstrated that the chameleon's tail, once pricked and used in the ritual, would cause death to occur within five days,\" Magistrate Mayambu said.\n\nThe lawyer for the two men, Agrippa Malando, said his clients pleaded for leniency as they were first-time offenders.\n\nHe urged the court to fine them, but the request was rejected.\n\nMagistrate Mayambu noted that many people in Zambia, like in other African countries, believed in witchcraft, even though it was not scientifically proven.\n\nThe law was designed to protect society from fear and harm caused by those claiming to have the power to carry out acts of witchcraft, he said.\n\n\"The question is not whether the accused are wizards or actually possess supernatural powers. It is whether they represented themselves as such, and the evidence clearly shows they did,\" Magistrate Mayambu said.\n\nIn addition to the two-year sentence they were given for \"professing\" witchcraft, the men were sentenced to six months in prison for possessing charms.\n\nAs the sentences will run concurrently, they will serve only two years in prison, effective from the date of their arrest in December 2024.\n\nHichilema has previously said he does not believe in witchcraft. He has not commented on the case.\n\nLawyer Dickson Jere told the BBC that the Witchcraft Act was passed during colonial rule in 1914.\n\nHe said people were \"very rarely\" prosecuted for practising witchcraft, but it helped protect elderly women who faced mob justice in villages after being accused of bewitching someone and causing their death.\n\nWitchcraft has also featured prominently in conversations over the protracted dispute between the government and the family of the late President Edgar Lungu over his funeral.\n\nSome people believe that the government's insistence that he should be buried in Zambia, contrary to his family's wishes, may be for \"occult reasons\".\n\nThe government has denied the accusation.\n\nLungu died in South Africa in June, and his body is still in a morgue there because of the failure to reach agreement over his burial.",

The country's market watchdog did not give details of how Nvidia had breached the rules, but said it would continue to investigate the matter. The news came as US and Chinese officials held a second day of trade talks in Spain on Monday in the latest attempt to end a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Following the talks, US President Donald Trump hinted that a deal had been reached with China to avert a US ban on TikTok.\n\nThe social media app was facing a ban in America unless it found a US buyer. The US-China trade talks in Spain were led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Following the talks, Mr Bessent said: \"We had very good discussions. We preferred to keep the discussions on TikTok, we will be holding trade negotiations in about a month again at a different location.\"\n\nTop level trade delegations from Beijing and Washington last met in July, when they struck a deal to extend their tariffs truce by another 90 days until 10 November.\n\nThe tariffs truce between China and the US cut import taxes that had reached more than 100% on each other's goods.\n\nChina launched an investigation into Nvidia in December last year which was seen as the latest retaliation in a battle between the US and China over the semiconductor chip market. The US had been tightening restrictions on sales of certain exports to Chinese companies, including high-end semiconductors. The talks in Madrid were expected to address the issue of what chips, including those made by Nvidia, would be allowed to enter China. The BBC has contacted Nvidia for comment.\n\nReuters China-US trade talks, headed by China's He Lifeng and Scott Bessent of the US, started on Sunday\n\nAfter initially calling for TikTok to be banned during his first term, Trump has reversed his stance on the popular video-sharing app and delayed the ban three times so far. Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said a deal was \"reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!\" There had been expectations that the deadline, which was due to expire on Wednesday, might be extended for a fourth time. Although Trump was highly critical of TikTok during his first term in the White House, he softened his position after he gained popularity on the app during the 2024 presidential election.",

      "content": "Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sport\n\nOn Sunday, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the Spanish prime minister \"a disgrace\" and accused him of inciting pro-Palestinian protests in Madrid, which caused the cancellation of the final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling race, in which an Israeli team was competing.\n\nHe said Israel should be treated in the same way as Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image,\" he told elected representatives of his Socialist Workers' Party.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has called for Israel to be excluded from international sports competitions over its actions in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence.\n\n\"It's a relief to me that thousands and thousands of people mobilise against that genocide, because it is genocide and it has no other name,\" said Óscar López, the minister of digital transformation.\n\nSeveral Spanish government ministers also praised the final stage protest, which involved about 100,000 people, according to official figures.\n\nEarlier in the day, Sánchez had said that previous protests during the three-week race had shown that Spain \"shines as an example, with pride\" on the Gaza issue.\n\nCulture Minister Ernest Urtasun also said Israel should not take part in the next Eurovision Song Contest, repeating calls made by Sánchez earlier this year.\n\n\"We have to make sure that Israel does not take part in the next Eurovision,\" Urtasun said.\n\nThe public broadcasters of Ireland and the Netherlands have already said they will not participate if Israel is included in the contest, because of the \"appalling\" and \"severe\" loss of lives and human suffering in Gaza.\n\nThe relationship between Israel and Spain has been fragile since late 2023, when Sánchez expressed concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza and some members of his government at the time called for diplomatic relations to be severed.\n\nIn 2024, Spain joined Norway and Ireland in acknowledging a Palestinian state and last week, Sánchez accused Israel of genocide and announced a series of measures against it, including an arms embargo.\n\nIsrael's Saar responded by accusing Sanchez's administration of being antisemitic and of using \"wild and hateful rhetoric\".\n\nA recent poll by the Elcano Royal Institute think tank indicated at least 82% of Spaniards believe genocide is being committed in Gaza.\n\nTwo days after Sánchez's announcement, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, called for a suspension of free trade and bilateral support with Israel, as she spoke of the \"man-made famine\" in Gaza.\n\nVon der Leyen also lamented what she called Europe's \"painful\" inability to find an adequate response to Israel's actions.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas.\n\nIsrael has accused international aid agencies like the UN of not picking up aid waiting at Gaza's border, pointing to the hundreds of trucks sitting idle.\n\nIn August, the UN-backed food monitor, the IPC, confirmed that famine was taking place in parts of Gaza. Israel is accused of causing the famine through ongoing restrictions on food and medical aid entering the territory.\n\nIsrael controls all border crossings into the Gaza Strip, and as the occupying power bears responsibility for protecting civilian life under international law, which includes the prevention of starvation.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nAt least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

      "content": "Boss of degrading sex-trade ring in Dubai's glamour districts unmasked by BBC\n\n17 hours ago Share Save Runako Celina BBC Eye Investigations Share Save\n\nWatch: Charles Mwesigwa - known locally as Abbey - says his women are \"open-minded\"\n\nWarning: Contains disturbing content and graphic descriptions of sexual acts A man running a sex ring operating out of Dubai's most glamorous neighbourhoods, and exploiting vulnerable women, has been identified by a BBC investigation. Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to. Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.\n\nOutside of the UK you can watch on YouTube\n\nOne of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.\n\nFamily handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda\n\nMia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.\n\nWarsan Tower in Dubai, from which Monic Karungi fell in May 2022\n\nFinding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.\n\nMr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver\n\n\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\". When asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. \"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run.\n\nTroy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa\n\nHe says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. \"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. \"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022.\n\nInstagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died\n\nMonic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. \"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation.\n\nInstagram Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan, also died after falling from a Dubai high-rise building\n\nKayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. \"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us.\n\nMonic's family in rural Uganda say Monic always had the ambition to seek a better life",

      "content": "Netanyahu does not rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders\n\n44 minutes ago Share Save Tom Bennett Jerusalem Share Save\n\nIsrael Prime Minister's Office Rubio's visit comes less than a week after Israel attacked the territory of its ally Qatar\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out further strikes on Hamas leaders following last week's attack in Qatar, saying they would not have immunity \"wherever they are\". Speaking at a Jerusalem press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu said every country had the right \"to defend itself beyond its borders\". Israel's decision to target Hamas leaders in Qatar - a close US ally - drew international outrage and criticism from US President Donald Trump. Hamas said six people were killed but that its leaders survived. Netanyahu's comments come days after the White House said Trump had assured Qatar \"that such a thing will not happen again on their soil\".\n\nWhen pressed on whether the US had any involvement in the strike, Netanyahu told journalists: \"We did it on our own. Period.\" In response to a BBC question about whether the strike had damaged US relations in the region, Rubio said Washington maintained \"strong relationships with our Gulf allies\". The pair presented a broadly united front, even amid the apparent tensions, with Rubio praising the two countries' technological and cultural ties - and Netanyahu saying Israel had \"no better ally\". Their meeting comes as Arab leaders hold a summit in a show of support for Qatar. The Qatari prime minister urged the international community to stop applying \"double standards\" and to punish Israel.\n\nCCTV captures moment of Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Doha\n\nQatar hosts a major US airbase and has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel. It has hosted the Hamas political bureau since 2012. According to a State Department official, Rubio will travel on to Qatar following his Israel trip. On Sunday, Netanyahu told reporters that the US-Israel relationship was as \"durable as the stones in the Western Wall\" while he and Rubio made a short visit to the holy site in Jerusalem's Old City. During the trip - on which they were accompanied by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee - Rubio wrote a note and placed it into the wall, a traditional ritual performed by visitors. The men ignored reporters' questions focusing on Israel's strikes in Qatar. Also thought to have been discussed by Netanyahu and Rubio are Israeli military plans to seize Gaza City and Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Over the weekend, the Israeli military pressed ahead with the demolition of residential buildings in Gaza City, and - according to local media - is now poised to begin ground operations in the Western neighbourhoods of the city. It has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave and head south to a central area of the strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimate about 250,000 Palestinians have fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area. Some say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern Gaza is not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some have said they attempted to go south but were unable to pitch their tents, so returned to Gaza City.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Gaza City in recent days, ahead of Israel's planned offensive\n\nAnadolu via Getty Images The Israeli military has targeted high-rise tower blocks in Gaza City",

The Met said an international letter of request was sent to Christian Brückner, ahead of his imminent release for a separate offence, which he later rejected. German national Brückner, 48, has never been charged with any crime in relation to the McCann case and denies any involvement. Madeleine vanished in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007. She and her siblings had been left sleeping in a holiday apartment while her parents, Kate and Gerry, went for dinner at a nearby restaurant.\n\nThey had checked in on the children periodically until Kate discovered Madeleine was missing at around 22:00. Brückner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman at her home in Praia da Luz in 2005. German authorities have said he will be released by Wednesday. Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell said Brückner remains a suspect in the Met Police's own investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. He has been the prime suspect in the German and Portuguese investigations since 2020 and 2022, respectively. \"We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an International Letter of Request which has been submitted,\" Det Ch Insp Cranwell said. \"It was subsequently refused by the suspect. In the absence of an interview, we will nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry. \"We can provide no further information while the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nHandout Madeleine McCann disappeared in 2007, then aged three\n\nMadeleine's disappearance has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world. German prosecutors have pointed to evidence - including mobile phone data - indicating Brückner may have been in the area when she vanished, and have consistently insisted that they think he is responsible. However, they have not found strong enough evidence to bring charges. Brückner, who spent many years in the Algarve, was a drifter, a petty criminal and a convicted sex offender. He has several previous convictions, including for sexually abusing children in 1994 and 2016. Portuguese and German police conducted a fresh search between where the McCanns had been staying and addresses linked to Brückner in June this year, but this yielded no breakthroughs.\n\nPA Media Investigators have been searching scrubland and abandoned buildings in the latest searches for Madeleine McCann",

Australia's first National Climate Risk Assessment predicted more frequent and severe climate hazards like floods, cyclones, heatwaves, droughts and bushfires. \"Australians are already living with the consequences of climate change today,\" Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said, \"but it's clear every degree of warming we prevent now will help future generations avoid the worst impacts in years to come.\" The report looked at three global warming scenarios - above 1.5C, above 2C and above 3C.\n\nAustralia - one of the world's biggest polluters per capita - has already reached warming of above 1.5C, the report said, noting that at 3C, heat-related deaths in Sydney may rise by more than 400% and almost triple in Melbourne. The 72-page report - released days before the government announces its emissions reduction targets for 2035 - found that no Australian community will be immune from climate risks that will be \"cascading, compounding and concurrent\". It warned of more heatwave-related deaths, poorer water quality due to severe flooding and bushfires, and property values to drop by A$611bn ($406bn; £300bn). By 2050, the report found the number of coastal communities located in \"high and very high risk areas\" in Australia will increase and if populations levels remain at current levels, this will mean more than 1.5 million people will be at risk. Areas in northern Australia, along with remote communities and outer suburbs of major cities, were particularly at risk, the report said. \"This will put pressure on health, critical infrastructure, natural species and ecosystems, and primary industries,\" the report warned, as well as posing extra challenges for emergency responders. The report also found that coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia - both already hit by record bleaching events - will face higher risks of \"bleaching and biodiversity loss\" due to warmer oceans.",

Tension has been high between the two countries since the US deployed warships to the Southern Caribbean on what officials said were counter-narcotics operations. As part of that deployment, the US launched an attack on a boat said to be carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing all 11 people on board. Asked by a journalist on Sunday whether the US would now \"start doing strikes on mainland Venezuela\", Trump answered: \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in New Jersey, the president said Venezuela was \"sending us their gang members, their drug dealers and drugs\". He said that maritime traffic in the Southern Caribbean had reduced significantly \"since the first strike\". Experts raised questions about legality of the 2 September attack on the alleged drug boat, saying that it may have violated international law. Venezuela responded by flying two F-16 fighter jets over a US Navy destroyer two days later. That led Trump to warn that any Venezuelan jets putting \"us in a dangerous situation\" would be shot down. After a brief lull, tension rose again on Saturday when Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil accused US forces of boarding a Venezuelan vessel. Gil said the vessel, which he described as \"small, harmless\" fishing boat, was seized \"illegally and hostilely\" for eight hours.\n\nVenezuela Ministry of Information Venezuela's Ministry of Information released a photo of the vessel it said had been seized for eight hours",

      "content": "Politicians in at least 51 countries used homophobic or transphobic rhetoric during elections last year, from depicting LGBTQ+ identity as a foreign threat to condemning “gender ideology”, according to a new study of 60 countries and the EU.\n\nHowever, there were also gains for LGBTQ+ representation in some countries. Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time in Botswana, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil.\n\nAs the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems.\n\nThere is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nHe said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … or Hungary or the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.”\n\nLGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as the first transgender member of the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according to data from advert tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nIn the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”.\n\nDuring election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+.\n\nBefore the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right parties made big gains, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally.\n\nIn Indonesia, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote.\n\nThe Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”",

      "content": "A congressional staffer from Mexico’s ruling party has resigned after being called out online for comments he made on a major Mexican television news program about Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk’s murder.\n\nThe news network, Milenio, also released a public apology after the United States’ deputy secretary of state – a former ambassador to Mexico – evidently threatened to have Donald Trump’s presidential administration revoke any US visas on which it may count.\n\nThe episode that unfolded at Milenio continued a trend of people losing their jobs over commentary about Kirk – a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate – deemed offensive by American conservatives, though in this instance it was outside the US.\n\nKirk, a close Trump ally, was shot dead Wednesday while speaking at a university in Utah. Following his death, conservative commentators, activists and public officials in the US have engaged in social media campaigns against people accused of disrespecting Kirk’s memory.\n\nA Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended.\n\nOn Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador, warned on X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”.\n\n“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the state department can protect the American people,” said Landau, who was appointed US ambassador to Mexico and served from 2019 to 2021 during Trump’s first presidency.\n\nPeople began responding to Landau’s post with examples of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk’s death. Among those was a clip of Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for the ruling Morena party, speaking on a television news program on Milenio.\n\nRamírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk’s killing.\n\n“I think if Charlie Kirk lived, he may like what I am about to say, because what I am about to say is very ‘anti-woke’,” Ramírez facetiously said. “He was given a spoonful of his own chocolate. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. They gave a spoonful to someone who was financed by the National Rifle Association – a political association that is of the extreme right, pro-Trump, of the most radical wing of the Republicans.”\n\nRamírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”.\n\nAfter a post tagging Milenio and the Morena party made Landau aware of Ramirez’s comments, he responded with an image reading “El Quitavisas”, roughly meaning “the visa remover”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico.\n\n“Really, Milenio? This is the level of ‘discourse’ that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,” Landau wrote.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later that evening, Ramirez officially announced his resignation from the parliamentary group for the Morena party within the Mexican house of representatives.\n\nOthers who had similarly lost their jobs or been disciplined at them over commentary about Kirk’s killing have included journalists, academic workers, teachers, nurses a Secret Service employee, a firefighter and a worker for an NFL team.\n\nPreviously, the Trump administration has targeted people, including students and academic workers, for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments on social media and for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nThe FBI announced on Friday that Kirk’s alleged killer had been arrested after a two-day manhunt.",

      "content": "Press freedom around the world has suffered its sharpest fall in 50 years as global democracy weakens dramatically, a landmark report has found.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), democracy has declined in 94 countries over the last five years and only a third have made progress.\n\n“Democracy faces a perfect storm of autocratic resurgence and acute uncertainty, due to massive social and economic changes,” Kevin Casas-Zamora, the secretary-general of the thinktank, said.\n\n“To fight back, democracies need to protect key elements of democracy, like elections and the rule of law, but also profoundly reform government so that it delivers fairness, inclusion and shared prosperity.”\n\nThe International IDEA’s survey – the Global State of Democracy Report 2025 – is published annually and considered the most comprehensive of its kind, covering 174 countries and measuring democratic performance from 1975.\n\nThe survey found that the freedom of the press had worsened in a quarter of the countries, marking the broadest deterioration since the beginning of the dataset.\n\nThe three largest declines were seen in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso and Myanmar, all suffering historically high levels of civil conflict, poverty and political instability. The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his government used defamation lawsuits to silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year.\n\nThe report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. In New Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently.\n\n“Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes.\n\nChile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families.\n\nThe thinktank highlighted some positive developments: Africa recorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too.\n\nBut the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote.\n\n“These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said.\n\nIn 2021, International IDEA added the US to its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019.\n\nOne measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues.\n\n“Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.",

      "content": "Two men have been convicted in Zambia of planning to use witchcraft to kill the president, Hakainde Hichilema.\n\nLeonard Phiri, a village chief, and Jasten Mabulesse Candunde, a Mozambican citizen, were arrested in December after a cleaner reported hearing strange noises. Authorities said they were found to be in possession of a live chameleon and other “assorted charms”, including a red cloth, an unidentified white powder and an animal’s tail.\n\n“The motive of the crime was to kill the head of state,” the magistrate Fine Mayambu said in his ruling at a court in Lusaka. “The convicts were not only enemies of the head of state but all Zambians.”\n\nThe men were sentenced to two years in prison with hard labour.\n\nThe prosecution said they had been hired by the brother of the opposition MP Emmanuel “Jay Jay” Banda, who is facing trial for robbery, attempted murder and escaping custody.\n\nThe conviction, under a British colonial-era law that criminalises so-called witchcraft, comes as Hichilema has faced growing criticism for cracking down on free speech and political opposition.\n\nHichilema is using the courts to suppress his opponents, appointing allies to the election commission and “rewriting constitutional rules” for his own benefit before national elections next year, Sishuwa Sishuwa, a senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University said in a column for the Mail & Guardian, a South African newspaper.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said in its 2024 annual global human rights report: “The administration of President Hakainde Hichilema increasingly exhibited tendencies toward authoritarianism … the authorities harassed and intimidated journalists, youth activists and political opposition leaders for expressing dissent or criticism of the government.”\n\nMeanwhile, a furious row is raging over the burial of Hichilema’s predecessor and bitter rival Edgar Lungu, who died in South Africa in June. Lungu’s family have been fighting the repatriation of the body for a state funeral, claiming he did not want Hichilema to attend. A South African court is weighing whether to allow the Lungus to appeal against an earlier decision that the body should be sent back to Zambia.\n\nAccusations of witchcraft are not uncommon in Zambian politics. Amid the legal battle over Lungu’s funeral, rumours have been circulating that Hichilema wants to use the body for occult purposes.\n\n“Personally I don’t believe in witchcraft, never believed in witchcraft, as a person, as a family, as a Christian,” Hichilema told the journalist Martine Dennis last month when asked about the allegations on her Africa Here & Now podcast.\n\nHowever, many people in Zambia argue that traditional spiritual beliefs should not be criminalised.\n\n“I hate that colonial piece of legislation that attempts to outlaw a practice that it does not understand,” Gankhanani Moyo, a cultural heritage lecturer at the University of Zambia, told Associated Press.\n\nAgence France Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "content": "Early on 18 March 1976, Francisco Tenório Cerqueira Júnior, a Brazilian pianist who had played alongside some of Latin America’s greatest musicians, disappeared from the streets of Buenos Aires.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, his fate has remained a mystery, sparking desperate searches, raising suspicions of government complicity, and inspiring international documentaries. Now the mystery has been solved, with forensic scientists formally identifying Tenório Júnior’s body – and confirming he was a victim of Argentina’s bloody dictatorship.\n\n“He left his hotel in the centre of the city and the earth ate him,” said Carlos “Maco” Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF). “Nothing more was ever known – until now.”\n\nTenório Júnior, known to most as Tenorinho, was regarded as one of the leading figures of the bossa nova movement – Brazil’s celebrated fusion of samba and jazz. One critic praised him as a pianist with “hands of gold” and an “enormous future”.\n\nOn 17 March 1976, during a South American tour, he performed alongside the Brazilian legends Vinícius de Moraes and Toquinho at the Gran Rex in Buenos Aires. Around 3am the following morning, the 34-year-old left his downtown hotel in search of cigarettes and aspirin, and was never seen again.\n\nIn the days that followed, his fellow musicians searched frantically, combing through the hospitals and morgues. Moraes, the lyricist of The Girl from Ipanema, filed a habeas corpus writ and appealed directly to the Brazilian ambassador. By then, Tenorinho, a husband and father of four, was already dead: he had been seized by the Argentinian military and executed, his body dumped in wasteland 30km away.\n\nHis killing came less than a week before a military coup d’état, which plunged the country into a dark chapter of fear, torture and forced disappearances.\n\nOver seven years, tens of thousands of political opponents, student activists, journalists, intellectuals – and countless bystanders – would be abducted, held in clandestine detention centres, tortured and killed. Some were thrown alive from planes, others disposed of in mass graves. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were disappeared.\n\nDecades after Tenorinho’s disappearance, at the 2014 National Truth Commission, his widow, Carmen Magalhães Tenório Cerqueira, demanded answers for what happened to her husband. “Where is Tenorinho?” she pressed. “Tenório was a person who never had any involvement with politics. He was a person who lived for music … And what happened to him is really something that … is absurd,” she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Carlos Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team. Photograph: Harriet Barber\n\nToquinho channelled his pain into a song called Lembranças, or Memories: “Tenório went out alone into the night / He disappeared / No one could explain.”\n\nOver the years, various witnesses came forward; a man working at a newsstand near the hotel said he saw Tenorinho taken away in a green Ford Falcon – the infamous car of choice used by Argentina’s death squads.\n\nOfficial confirmation of what happened would finally come thanks, primarily, to an Argentinian forensic team which to this day excavates and identifies those disappeared by the military regime.\n\nThe group was originally set up by the Texas forensic anthropologist Dr Clyde Snow – renowned for identifying the skeleton of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele – after Argentina’s return to democracy. They made an unusual team at first; unable to find willing colleagues, with many Argentinians still fearful of a return to the dictatorship, Snow had instead recruited a collection of anthropology students.\n\n“None of us were jumping with joy to do this, because if we started to work on this and a new military coup occurred, we would end up on the list of people who could disappear,” said Mercedes “Mimi” Doretti, one of the founders, last year. “But at the same time, we couldn’t say no.”\n\nDecades on, the group continues to search for the victims of the dictatorship, scouring archives, interviewing witnesses, corroborating timelines and conducting digs at suspected mass graves. Today, technological advances also have made it possible to conduct mass fingerprint comparisons – the technique that ultimately led to Tenorinho’s discovery. More than 1,500 bodies have been recovered, and more than 840 people identified.\n\n“At the same time that the state had been torturing, killing and throwing people from planes, they kept their bureaucratic ways of working, recording deaths, taking fingerprints of the corpses,” said Somigliana, who has worked with the EAAF since 1986. “In many cases, the state tried to avoid this, by burning the bodies, cutting hands off, but in others they left a chain of documents.”\n\nWhile the team had been seeking Tenorinho’s fingerprints for some years, his case gained momentum in 2024, when the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity found an old file containing the details of a murder victim who had “appeared in a small unoccupied piece of land” in the Tigre district on 20 March 1976.\n\n“The death certificate said ‘man with many gunshots, around 30 years old, with a beard’,” said Somigliana.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dr Clyde Snow and the EAAF. Photograph: No credit\n\n“We compared the fingerprints with all of those people kidnapped in Argentina, and there was no match. Why? Because he was not from Argentina. Then we asked for the fingerprints from Brazil, and when they came, we were able to confirm that this body was him.”\n\nTenorinho’s unnamed body was buried at the Benavídez municipal cemetery on 22 March 1976, but later excavated and put into a common grave. At present, there are no plans to begin exhumations of the common grave.\n\nWhile the identification does not in itself prove the military killed Tenorinho, the manner of his murder and the way his body was discarded mirror the fate of countless others disappeared by the military.\n\nHis remains were discovered in the same area where other victims of clandestine detention centres had been dumped, cases later proven to be linked directly to the regime. He was also shot more than once, the typical way the military killed victims. While the typical registration of the death – taking the fingerprints and photos of the body – was conducted, his identification was not completed, a further hallmark of state crimes. The EAAF said they had no reason to doubt Tenorinho was a victim of state terrorism in the days before the military coup.\n\nTenorinho, who was born in Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, was one of 11 Brazilians kidnapped in Argentina during the dictatorship. He had no political affiliations, and it has long been surmised that he was picked up for how he looked: he wore glasses and had a long beard, features the dictatorship associated with leftists.\n\nView image in fullscreen Tenorinho on his wedding day. Photograph: c/o Family\n\nHe left behind his wife, Carmen, who was eight months pregnant at the time of his disappearance, and four other children. His parents, who for years sought answers to their son’s whereabouts, died around the 10th anniversary of his murder. His surviving family was informed of the identification this week.\n\nCarmen has passed away, along with two of the children. In a statement, the three remaining children said: “We received the news of the identification of our father’s body with surprise, of course, and with a mixture of relief and sadness. Relief because, finally, we can know with more certainty what happened to him in that sad March of 1976. Somehow, we will be closer – saddened by the confirmation that Tenório was a victim of violence and buried as an unknown, far from family, friends, music colleagues.”\n\nThey said his death deprived them of his company and forced their mother to raise five children alone, one who was born a month after their father’s disappearance. “Tenório never met his youngest son, nor his eight grandchildren,” the children wrote. “We still want and need answers. Who killed Tenório? Why? Why kill a man with no political involvement, who only lived for music?”\n\nTenorinho’s identification comes against an emerging climate of denialism in Argentina.\n\nIn late 2023, Argentina elected Javier Milei as its president – a hard-right leader who has been accused by rights organisations of attempting to “rewrite the history” of the dictatorship’s crimes. He has previously declared “there were no 30,000” people disappeared, and called into question the extent of the military’s crimes. His party has also begun dismantling the Human Rights Secretariat, downgrading the body and recently laying off hundreds of workers.\n\nLast year six lawmakers from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party visited a jail to meet prisoners convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, including Alfredo Astiz, the so-called “Angel of Death”. The politicians later claimed they were reviewing the living conditions of the detainees.\n\nThe office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity, nonetheless, is continuing its dictatorship-era work and is reviewing cases involving the discovery of unidentified corpses in public streets in the province of Buenos Aires between 1975 and 1983.\n\n“We have already identified approximately 600 files, 475 of which are under analysis,” said María Ángeles Ramos, one of the country’s lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship-era crimes.\n\nThe EAAF, which operates as a non-profit, is also committed to continuing its work. The team has become world-renowned, finding and identifying remains all over the world including genocide victims in Darfur, and the bodies of the Chilean president Salvador Allende and the guerrilla Che Guevara.",

      "content": "South African prosecutors will reopen an inquest into the death of the prominent anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, nearly 50 years after he died in police custody.\n\nBiko, the founder of South Africa’s Black Consciousness Movement, died in a prison cell in 1977 aged just 30, after being beaten into a coma by police who had arrested him nearly a month earlier.\n\nThe death sparked outrage across the world and he became an international symbol of the struggle against the race-based apartheid system that denied South Africa’s black majority political and economic rights.\n\n“The main goal of reopening the inquest is to lay before the court evidence that will enable the court to make a finding … as to whether the death was brought about by any act, or omission, which prima facie involves or amounts to an offence on the part of any person,” the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Wednesday.\n\nThe case will be reopened on the 48th anniversary of Biko’s death on 12 September.\n\nA 1977 inquest accepted the police account that Biko sustained injuries when he hit his head against the wall and no one was prosecuted for the death.\n\nBut in 1997, former police officers implicated in the case admitted assaulting the activist during hearings by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) into atrocities committed during the apartheid era.\n\nThe TRC refused to grant amnesty to the officers, ruling that they lied in their evidence and failed to prove a political motive for killing Biko.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Long Wave Free weekly newsletter Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In April the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, launched an inquiry into whether past ANC governments interfered with the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes, amid criticism from the families of victims.\n\nIn June an inquest was opened into one of the period’s most notorious crime: the deaths of four men known as the Cradock Four, who were stopped at a roadblock in 1985 by security officers and beaten, strangled with telephone wire, stabbed and shot to death.",

      "content": "Thousands of Brazilians have taken to the streets to rejoice at Jair Bolsonaro’s conviction for plotting a coup, as progressive politicians celebrated the historic move and rightwing figures linked to Donald Trump responded with anger and threats.\n\nChile’s leftwing president, Gabriel Boric, led regional congratulations of the decision to jail Bolsonaro for 27 years for leading a criminal organisation that sought to seize power after the far-right populist lost the 2022 election.\n\n“My respect to Brazilian democracy which fended off a coup attempt and today judges and convicts those responsible for it. They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”\n\nColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted. Those are the rules of democracy.”\n\nIn Latin America, 11 September is a date deeply associated with authoritarianism and violence: it was on this day in 1973 that Gen Augusto Pinochet launched a US-backed coup in Chile that ushered in 17 years of brutal military rule during which thousands were killed or forcibly disappeared.\n\nBut on Thursday jubilant crowds in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, celebrated how Bolsonaro’s conviction had given new meaning to the notorious date.\n\n“I’m really overflowing with joy. This is such a symbolic day for us,” said Renan Vidal, a bank worker who was also celebrating his 37th birthday as Bolsonaro and seven co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy.\n\n“It’s the best birthday present ever,” said Vidal, who wore a rainbow flag over his shoulders. “I’m part of the LGBT community and our community was one of the worst affected by the Bolsonaro government. So for us it’s a moment to commemorate,” he added as fireworks exploded above the throng.\n\nYucca Nani, 34, said her generation associated 11 September with another terrible event: the 9/11 attacks in the US. “It was the day that changed the history of the modern world,” she said, adding: “Now in Brazil [the date] has a new meaning, which is Bolsonaro’s conviction.”\n\nAlso at the street party was Beatriz Matos, an anthropologist whose husband, the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, was murdered in the Amazon with British journalist Dom Phillips during Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. Many believe Bolsonaro’s violent, pro-gun rhetoric and dismantling of environmental and Indigenous protections helped create the backdrop for the crime.\n\n“I feel relief, happiness and fire in my eyes,” Matos said of Bolsonaro’s demise. “We must celebrate. Justice is being done!”\n\nBeto Marubo, an Indigenous leader who is godfather to Pereira’s son, said: “This is a special day for us Indigenous people and for minorities … We were the ones who most suffered under Bolsonaro and this is a breath of justice.”\n\nThose festivities contrasted with the ire of Bolsonaro backers, in and outside of Brazil.\n\nThe US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, accused Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge who oversaw Bolsonaro’s trial, of “laying waste to the rule of law” and “driving relations between our two great nations to their darkest point in two centuries”.\n\nBolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has spent months lobbying Trump officials over his father’s fate, told Reuters he expected “a firm response with actions from the US government” after Thursday’s ruling.\n\nDescribing Bolsonaro as the victim of a “political execution”, Trump has hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and announced sanctions and visa revocations against supreme court judges and other officials.\n\nAsked on Thursday if he was planning further sanctions, Trump replied: “I thought he was a good president of Brazil and it’s very surprising that [this conviction] could happen.”\n\n“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” he added.\n\nTrump’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, said: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch-hunt.​”\n\nAt the carnival-style party in Brasília, revellers shrugged off those US warnings – as did Brazil’s foreign ministry which said “threats like the one made today by [Rubio] … will not intimidate our democracy”.\n\n“Let them do it,” Vidal said of possible further US pressure. “I think Brazil’s institutions are very solid and we will not cave in to Trump’s sanctions, however powerful his country may be.”\n\nA carnival parade called the Victory of Democracy Procession is planned in Rio on Friday night.",

      "content": "At least 17 people have been confirmed dead in Bali, Indonesia, after the island’s worst flooding in more than a decade.\n\nTorrential rain last Tuesday and Wednesday triggered widespread flooding and landslides, leaving a trail of destruction. Eight victims were found in Denpasar, the island’s capital, and rescue teams continue to search for several others who remain missing.\n\nMost deaths occurred when victims were swept away by flood water. More than 385mm of rain was recorded within a 24-hour period, leading to the evacuation of hundreds of people. The floods submerged roads and damaged bridges, severely disrupting transport across the island.\n\nFlooding is common in Indonesia during the wet season, which typically runs from September to March. However, scientists say the climate crisis is intensifying the rainy season, bringing heavier rainfall and more frequent flash floods. Overdevelopment and widespread deforestation are believed to be worsening the impact of flooding.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian monsoon is in full force with devastating consequences. Half of the country is experiencing flooding, with the state of Punjab facing its worst floods since 1988. Landslides and flood waters have already killed hundreds of people across the country.\n\nIn neighbouring Pakistan, more than 2 million people have been evacuated from the eastern Punjab province. Since late June, monsoon-related floods have killed more than 900 people nationwide.\n\nThis year’s monsoon season began unusually early after India’s wettest May in 125 years. Traditionally, the monsoon starts in early June and lasts through to September.\n\nView image in fullscreen A tornado towers over the countryside near Young in New South Wales.

      "content": "President Donald Trump has said foreign workers sent to the United States are “welcome” and he doesn’t want to “frighten off” investors, 10 days after hundreds of South Koreans were arrested at a work site in Georgia.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize investment.\n\n“I want them to bring their people of expertise for a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very unique and complex products, as they phase out of our Country, and back into their land,” he wrote.\n\nAbout 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals, were arrested at the construction site of an electric vehicle battery factory, operated by Hyundai-LG, in the south-eastern US state of Georgia on 4 September.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials alleged South Koreans had overstayed their visas or held permits that didn’t allow them to perform manual labor.\n\nThe Georgia raid was the largest single-site operation conducted since Trump launched a sweeping immigration crackdown across the country.\n\nThough the US decided against deportation, images of the workers being chained and handcuffed during the raid caused widespread alarm in South Korea. Seoul repatriated the workers on Friday.\n\nThe South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, called the raid “bewildering” and warned on Thursday that the raid could discourage future investment.\n\nIn his post, Trump described the circumstances for temporarily allowing foreign experts into the US to build “extremely complex products”.\n\n“Chips, Semiconductors, Computers, Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others how to make, or, in many cases, relearn because we used to be great at it, but not anymore,” Trump wrote.\n\n“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime in the not too distant future,” the president added.\n\nKorea’s trade unions have called on Trump to issue an official apology.",

      "content": "British authorities may have certain concerns about the cyber-spying threat from vehicles made in China, but it turns out the country’s manufacturers have security worries of their own.\n\nInsurers have told Chinese carmakers they need critical modifications for vehicles on British streets: namely, tougher locking devices to make them harder to steal.\n\nWith an average of 11 reported vehicle thefts an hour in the UK, and car crime comparatively rare under Beijing’s strict authoritarian regime, industry sources said it had been a “swift learning curve”.\n\nAdditions to cars exported to the UK from China have ranged from the simply mechanical, such as lockable wheel nuts and an extra layer of steel around the car door locks, to software to detect and guard against unauthorised entry.\n\nSales of Chinese cars have risen sharply in Britain this year, now accounting for about one in 12 of all new cars sold, including those made by MG and electric car firm BYD. New entrants such as Chery, which started to sell its own-brand petrol SUVs this month, have sold about 20,000 new cars in the UK since launching the Omoda and Jaecoo brands here earlier this year.\n\nNew models for import are assessed for risk on behalf of insurers, with tests including a two-minute “attack test”, whose results led to a range of Chinese prototypes being beefed up against car thieves.\n\nBen Townsend, the head of automotive at Thatcham Research, a vehicle risk intelligence company, said: “We’ve worked closely with Chinese vehicle manufacturers advising on vehicle security enhancements for the UK market.\n\n“In China, vehicle crime is not the same challenge we experience in the UK and Europe, so certain anti-theft features – like immobilisers, door shielding to prevent access to internal locking mechanisms, and software-based intrusion detection – haven’t historically been prioritised.”\n\nHe added: “These features often don’t require major structural interventions, which means they can be applied to completed new models, and we’ve found Chinese brands to be highly responsive and agile in implementing improvements.”\n\nChery executives said modifications had been swiftly delivered in the Chinese production process. Factory and other staff typically work a six-day week, on lower wages that have contributed to Chinese cars underpricing western comparators.\n\nOli Lowe, the UK head of product for Chery UK, said the Chinese manufacturer had dedicated regional research and development centres to get its cars ready for sale here. He said: “Simple but crucial adaptations, such as the addition of locking wheel bolts, ensure that vehicles not only meet local requirements but also deliver enhanced security and customer confidence for our buyers in the UK.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "content": "China’s economy showed further signs of weakness last month as it comes under strain from Donald’s Trump trade wars and domestic problems, with factory output and consumer spending rising at their slowest pace for about a year.\n\nThe disappointing data adds pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to fend off a sharp slowdown, with a debt crisis denting the country’s once-booming property sector and exports facing stronger headwinds.\n\nEconomists were split over whether policymakers should introduce more near-term fiscal support to hit their annual 5% growth target, with manufacturers awaiting further clarity on a US trade deal and domestic demand curbed by an uncertain job market and property crisis.\n\nIndustrial output grew by 5.2% year on year last month, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Monday, the lowest reading since August 2024 and below the 5.7% rise in July. Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, expanded 3.4%, the slowest pace since November 2024, and cooling from a 3.7% rise in the previous month.\n\nA spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s ailing property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.\n\nChina’s economy remains heavily reliant on exports which have been dealt a blow by the trade war with the US. Although the two countries agreed a pause on tariffs until 10 November, China recorded a slump in US-bound exports last month. China’s exports to the US fell by 33.12% year on year in August, according to customs data. Overall exports increased by 4.4% in August.\n\n“The activity data point to a further loss of momentum,” Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. “While some of this reflects temporary weather-related disruptions, underlying growth is clearly sliding, raising pressure on policymakers to step in with additional support.”\n\nFactory activity was hit by the hottest conditions since 1961 and the longest rainy season for the same period.\n\nAuthorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to offset Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies and weak consumer spending.\n\nSeparate data this month showed factory owners have had some success diverting US-bound shipments to south-east Asia, Africa and Latin America, but the drag from the property crisis continues.\n\nLynn Song, the chief economist for Greater China at ING, suggested the weak data indicated “further stimulus support could be needed to ensure a strong finish to the year”.\n\nShe said: “While it is too early to gauge the impact of the consumer loan subsidies coming into effect in September, it is likely that more policy support is still needed, given the broader slowdown across the board.” Song said there was a “high possibility” of further interest rate cuts in coming weeks.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Images of the workers chained and handcuffed shocked South Korea, prompting a stern rebuke from Seoul.\n\nAfter delicate diplomatic negotiations, the detained South Korean workers were released and flown back to Seoul. Some of the workers told local media about appalling conditions during their arrest, including allegations they were held without being informed of their rights.\n\nWhen asked about those allegations, the presidential office in Seoul said it was conducting a “thorough review”.\n\n“Both our side and the US are checking if there were any shortcomings in the measures taken and companies are also looking into it,” the presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung told a press briefing. “Together with the company concerned, we are conducting a more thorough review into possible human rights infringements.”\n\nOne of the workers told Yonhap News Agency that their rights were not read when they were arrested. The worker also told the agency they were angry that Ice agents mocked them with remarks about “North Korea” and “rocket man” – an insult Trump has previously used about Pyongyang’s leader, Kim Jong-un.\n\nSouth Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, called the raid “bewildering” and noted it could have a chilling effect on future investment. South Korean companies “can’t help but question whether setting up a plant in the US is worth the potential risks”, Lee said.\n\nIn what seemed to be a response, Trump said on Sunday that foreign workers were “welcome” and he did not want to scare investors.\n\n“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize investment,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.",

      "content": "The conspirators used codenames to conceal their identities as they prepared for their mission: to plunge Brazil into chaos by assassinating a celebrity supreme court judge called Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nOn an encrypted messaging group, one plotter used the alias Brazil, another Japan and a third Austria.\n\n“Each of them had the name of a team,” Moraes said this week as he denounced the alleged plot to murder him as part of an attempt to destroy South America’s largest democracy.\n\nThe group of football-loving would-be assassins abandoned their task at the last minute.\n\n“I’m close to the position. Are you going to cancel the game?” the person codenamed Austria asked their associates on their Signal group at just before 9pm on 15 December 2022, as he lurked near Moraes’s home in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.\n\n“Abort,” replied “Germany”, according to a federal police report.\n\nThe cinematic plot, nicknamed Operation Copa 2022 (Operation World Cup 2022) and involving at least six special forces troops, was at the heart of this week’s historic trial of Brazil’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro. He was on Thursday sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stage a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula.\n\n“[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state,” said Moraes as he accused Bolsonaro of being the leader of a sprawling conspiracy, which included plans to assassinate Lula and the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, to stop them taking power on 1 January 2023.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters at a protest this month. Photograph: Luis Nova/AP\n\nMoraes said hitmen had planned to “neutralise” him using “extremely powerful weapons” capable of piercing his bullet-proof car; they also allegedly considered killing Lula during a public event with poison or drugs that would cause organ failure.\n\n“I’m someone who should be really thankful to be alive,” Lula said last year after the alleged poison plot was revealed.\n\nBolsonaro has denied engineering a coup or being involved in an assassination plot, calling such claims “a little story”.\n\nBut Moraes said there was “ample evidence” indicating the far-right politician was aware of Operation World Cup 2022, which the judge said was part of a larger intrigue called Green and Yellow Dagger.\n\nPolice investigators said a copy of the blueprint for a “clandestine operation” with “terrorist hallmarks” was printed out in the presidential palace on 6 December 2022 by an army general called Mário Fernandes. At the time Gen Fernandes, who was arrested last year, was a senior official in Bolsonaro’s administration.\n\n“This [plan] wasn’t printed out in a cave. It wasn’t printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government … at the same moment that president Jair Messias Bolsonaro was there,” Moraes told the court on Tuesday as Bolsonaro’s trial reached its conclusion.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alexandre de Moraes and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who said he was ‘someone who should be really thankful to be alive’. Photograph: Adriano Machado/Reuters\n\n“The planning is so detailed that it even details the chances of success, what the collateral damage might be, what weaponry should be used,” added Moraes.\n\nA copy of the Green and Yellow Dagger plan, obtained by federal police investigators, suggests plotters planned to use an arsenal that included assault rifles, a belt-fed machine gun and even a Swedish anti-tank weapon, used on the battlefield in Ukraine. “These are weapons of war commonly used by combat groups,” the police report says.\n\nAccording to the investigators, the plan to assassinate Moraes was aborted only because a court session was delayed – and, more importantly, the commanders of the army and air force refused to endorse Bolsonaro’s coup plot.\n\nBrazil has had more than a dozen coup attempts since it became a republic in 1889 but none, so far as is known, involved a plan to assassinate those being deposed.\n\nThe historian Lucas Pedretti said that did not necessarily mean such plots had not existed. Rather, the 2022 plot had come to light because, for the first time in history, the coup plotters had been investigated and put on trial.\n\nPedretti said the existence of the assassination plan was “shocking, but not so surprising”. The historian, who studies Brazil’s brutal 1964-85 military dictatorship, said the armed forces still promoted internally the idea that the bloody regime was a “necessary and legitimate response” to a supposed communist threat.\n\nQuick Guide Brazil's dictatorship 1964-1985 Show How did it begin? Brazil’s leftist president, João Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule. The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974. What happened during the dictatorship? Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”. It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay. But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel. It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures. How did it end? Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy. But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte. Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\n“And this is particularly true in the case of the special forces,” he said, referring to the army group to which the men accused of plotting to kill Moraes, Lula and Alckmin belonged.\n\nPolice believe the men involved in the Moraes murder plot were special forces operatives known as the “kids pretos” or “black cap boys” because of the black caps they wore. Pedretti said the group, set up during the cold war, still maintained the same “enemy elimination mindset”.\n\n“In Bolsonaro’s attempted coup, spearheaded by him and his generals, they simply put that logic and the expertise of the ‘kids pretos’ at the service of the coup-mongering political project,” Pedretti said.",

      "content": "A scam weight-loss treatment marketed to Australians as an “oral solution” that mimics the effects of Ozempic contains nothing more than a watery saline solution similar to eye drops, analysis has revealed.\n\nGuardian Australia revealed last month that online “ghost stores” masquerading as Australian businesses had expanded into advertising weight-loss treatments and were impersonating real people to recommend their products.\n\nScientists from the University of New South Wales school of chemistry analysed a sample of the “STDEI GLP-1 Weight Loss Oral Liquid”, which was bought from the website Maementcurves.com on 23 July, on behalf of Guardian Australia.\n\nAccording to their analysis, the solution contained only small concentrations of any detectable compounds.\n\nThese were preservatives commonly found in cosmetics and some food including methylparaben and benzenesulfonic acid.\n\nDr Jake Violi of UNSW said there was “definitely” no GLP-1 or any other identifiable drug molecules in the sample, which was very salty and appeared to be “simply eye drops or some similar product”.\n\nGLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone in the body that helps regulate blood sugar levels and appetite, which can be stimulated by injectable drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nDr Violi said there was no way the product he tested could help someone lose weight and, while the preservatives he detected were safe for human consumption, he was concerned that it “could have contained anything”.\n\n“Luckily, this sample was benign – it’s basically salty water,” he said. “Clearly, the sale of such products is a scam.\n\nView image in fullscreen Supposed oral weight loss treatments packaged in green boxes are readily available on the internet. Photograph: Greatrfg.com\n\n“Pharmaceuticals are a tightly regulated industry for the safety of our population, and any goods sold outside of the regulatory frameworks are a cause for concern.”\n\nThe Maementcurves.com site, portraying itself as Australian, claimed the product had even saved the life of a customer who had been “seriously obese and close to death”.\n\nIt claimed the solution was made in Australia and developed by a local, family-owned company, although the box Guardian Australia received said the treatment had been “made in the USA” and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe return address on the package was for an office tower in Sydney’s CBD. Guardian Australia contacted the Maementcurves.com site for comment.\n\nCustomers have reported seeing Facebook ads for similar “weight-loss drops” linking to an array of other websites.\n\nIn one example reviewed by Guardian Australia, the site Greatrfg.com uses an Australian flag banner and sells a “GLP-1 Oral Solution For Weight Reduction”. Guardian Australia attempted to contact the site for comment but received an email bounce-back saying its “remote server is misconfigured”.\n\nView image in fullscreen The box Guardian Australia received said the treatment had been ‘made in the USA’ and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Photograph: Jon Beves/UNSW school of chemistry\n\nThe site claims the product is made locally and approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). But the terms of service say the website is operated by Hamjouy Limited, a company in Hong Kong.\n\nSimilar “weight-loss drops” – which come in distinctive green boxes – are readily available elsewhere on the internet including on eBay and Amazon.\n\nIt’s not clear if companies selling these products are making other fraudulent claims or mimicking registered corporate and health logos on their packaging.\n\nThe TGA, Australia’s medicines regulator, would not comment directly on the UNSW analysis but urged consumers to “exercise extreme caution”.\n\n“Prescription medicines purchased online may contain undisclosed harmful ingredients or may be counterfeit/fake,” a TGA spokesperson said.\n\n“We strongly advise consumers against using prescription medications that are offered or issued without a valid prescription and consultation with a health practitioner.”\n\nThey said counterfeit therapeutic goods could not be imported, advertised or supplied under any circumstances.\n\n“So if this or similar products are found to be counterfeit, if intercepted at the border they will be seized and destroyed,” they said.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission earlier this year urged the e-commerce platform Shopify and Facebook owner Meta to take responsibility for enabling the creation of ghost stores and allowing them to run false advertising.\n\nThe ACCC declined to comment.",

      "content": "Israel’s attacks in Gaza and the West Bank are not only killing people, but destroying economy and means of living.\n\nUnited Nations experts have warned of catastrophic economic damage as a result of Israel’s relentless attacks on Gaza and its “wider financial stranglehold” across occupied Palestinian territory.\n\n“Economic life in Gaza has been decimated by sheer physical destruction, blockade and siege, and repeated forced displacement,” the experts, including a special rapporteur and three UN-backed independent experts, said in a statement.\n\nThey said that in the starved and besieged enclave, most commercial, agricultural and industrial assets have been damaged or destroyed, while unemployment has surged to over 80 percent, gross domestic product (GDP) has dramatically shrunk, and trade has stalled.\n\n“Poverty is endemic. Famine has been declared,” wrote the experts, in reference to the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report last month that officially declared famine in parts of Gaza.\n\nThey pointed out that there is a liquidity crisis in Gaza as most banks and ATMs have been destroyed, Israel has blocked the inflow of new currency, and wages are paling in comparison to stratospheric inflation caused by a total siege.\n\nAfter the war, cooking oil prices rose by 1,200 percent and flour by 5,000 percent by mid-2025, they said, adding that humanitarian workers are reportedly losing nearly 40 percent of their salaries just to access their wages, and digital payments are impeded by electricity and telecommunications outages.\n\nThe four experts noted that the occupied West Bank is also under increasing financial strain as Israel has arbitrarily diverted or withheld tax revenues owed to the Palestinian Authority in violation of the Oslo Accords.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wants to cancel annual waivers that allow Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks, something the experts said “would cut Palestinians off from the global financial system”.\n\nMeanwhile, work permits have been suspended for 100,000 Palestinian workers, slashing cash inflows that previously represented a quarter of all gross national income.\n\n“These measures exacerbate heavy economic losses from the illegal taking of land and the illegal exploitation of natural resources by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank,” the experts said.\n\nThey emphasised that Israel is violating its human rights obligations and its legal requirements as an occupying power, and is impeding the collective rights of the Palestinian people to economic self-determination and control over natural wealth and resources.\n\nIn July, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory released a report mapping the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians and its genocidal war on Gaza, in breach of international law.\n\nFrancesca Albanese’s report named 48 corporate actors, including United States tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet Inc, which is Google’s parent company. A database of more than 1,000 corporate entities was also put together as part of the investigation.",

      "title": "Can the EU and NATO impose tariffs on India and China, as Trump wants?",
      "description": "In an effort to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, the US president proposes tariffs targeting Putin&#039;s major trading partners.",
      "content": "In an effort to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, US president proposes tariffs targeting Vladimir Putin’s major trading partners.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has called on NATO and EU member states to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100 percent to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump, who previously pledged to end the conflict on “day one” of becoming president, made his demand during a meeting between United States and European Union officials last Tuesday. The move is seen as a way to try to expedite a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump’s request to Brussels, first reported by the Financial Times newspaper, follows remarks from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said that Washington was preparing tighter economic restrictions on Russia but needed stronger European backing.\n\nIn a letter posted on his Truth Social account on September 13, Trump said he was “ready to do major sanctions on Russia” once NATO had “agreed … to do the same thing”. He also claimed that elevated tariffs on China would weaken Beijing’s “control” over Russia.\n\nWhy is Trump making the request?\n\nChina and India buy Russia’s oil, which is helping to keep the Russian economy afloat.\n\nAs the largest buyer of Russian energy, China imported 109 million tonnes of crude oil last year, representing nearly 20 percent of its total energy imports, according to Chinese customs data. India, by contrast, imported 88 million tonnes of Russian oil in 2024, or 15 percent of its imports.\n\nAnd while Trump recently slapped an extra 25 percent tariff on India for importing Russian crude, he has so far refrained from imposing similar tariffs on China as his administration navigates a delicate trade truce with Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo sidestep the issue, Trump on Saturday asked NATO to impose 50-100 percent tariffs on China to weaken Beijing’s economic grip over Russia.\n\nIn the letter Trump posted on Saturday, he claimed the halt on Russian energy purchases, combined with heavy tariffs on China, would be of “great help” in ending the conflict.\n\nEurope’s reliance on Russian energy has fallen since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the time, the EU imported 45 percent of its natural gas from Russia. That is expected to fall to just 13 percent this year. But Trump wants Europe to do more.\n\nThe US president’s requests come amid heightened tensions between NATO and Russia. More than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace last Wednesday, and one entered Romanian airspace on Saturday. Poland and Romania are both members of NATO.\n\nWarsaw said the drone incursion was deliberate, but Moscow downplayed the incident and said it had “no plans to target” Poland. Bucharest, meanwhile, scrambled fighter jets to intercept the Russian drone on Saturday evening and has denounced Moscow’s “irresponsible actions”.\n\nFrance and Germany have notably joined a new NATO mission to bolster the group’s eastern flank and will move some military assets eastwards.\n\nIn a Fox News interview last Friday, Trump said his patience with Putin was beginning to run out following recent face-to-face talks in Alaska and amid Russia’s increasing aerial attacks on Ukraine, including its largest-ever air attack earlier this month.\n\nThe US president expressed frustration with Putin’s failure to halt the war and said he is considering additional sanctions on Russian banks and energy products.\n\n“We’re going to have to come down very, very strong,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s push for allied tariffs against China and Russia comes at a time when his own legal authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is being challenged at home. In May, a US trade court ruled that the tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. An appeals court upheld that ruling in August, and the case is now headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nA decision over the legality of Trump’s tariffs is expected in November.\n\nCan the EU easily impose sanctions on China and India?\n\nThe bilateral trade in goods between Brussels and Beijing reached approximately 732 billion euros ($860bn) in 2024. The EU ran a trade deficit in goods with China of around 305.8 billion euros ($359bn) last year, up from about 297 billion euros ($349bn) in 2023, making China the EU’s largest import partner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context, the US remains Europe’s largest trading partner. In 2024, the total trade in goods and services between the EU and the US amounted to 1.68 trillion euros ($1.98 trillion). Here, the EU had a goods trade surplus of 198 billion euros ($233bn), and an overall surplus of 50 billion euros ($59bn).\n\nThe bulk of Europe’s imports from China – roughly 40 percent – come in the form of consumer electronics, followed by heavy manufacturing equipment and then clothing and accessories.\n\nEuropean goods imports from India, comparatively, are small. In 2024, the EU ran a goods trade deficit – mostly in the form of electronic equipment, pharmaceuticals and base metals like iron and steel – of just 22.5 billion euros ($26bn) with India.\n\nThe upshot is that Europe is highly dependent on goods imported from China — and much less so on India. Chinese manufacturing imports are deeply integrated into European supply chains.\n\nSuddenly imposing tariffs, particularly at levels of 50-100 percent, would disrupt manufacturing, increase production costs and raise consumer prices across the EU, which is why the bloc will likely be wary of adopting unilateral punitive tariffs.\n\nStill, some EU member states have publicly backed targeted measures against China. On September 12, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) bloc of nations – which includes France, Germany and Italy – convened a call to discuss additional sanctions on Russia and possible tariffs on countries they see as “enabling” the war in Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Turkiye, which is a NATO member, is the third-largest buyer of Russia’s oil products, after China and India. Other NATO members that purchase Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nWithin hours of Trump’s September 13 pronouncement to NATO members, Beijing responded by saying that China does not participate in wars or help to plot them.\n\nWang Yi, China’s foreign minister, said that war cannot solve problems and sanctions only complicate them, according to a statement from China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Bessent will meet with China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid on Monday to try to de-escalate trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nAs for US-India relations, Trump said on September 9 that the two countries were “continuing negotiations to address the trade barriers” between them.\n\nHe plans to speak to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming weeks and expects a “successful conclusion” to their trade talks, he wrote on social media.\n\nIn response, Modi echoed Trump’s optimism that the talks would be successful and said the two countries were “close friends and natural partners”.\n\n“Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest,” Modi said. “I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump.”",

It will govern the country for six months until national elections are held in early March.\n\nTheir appointments come less than a week after veteran leader KP Sharma Oli resigned as prime minister amid unrest that deepened when demonstrators were shot dead by police on Monday.\n\nLed by Gen Z, the protests quickly escalated, with key public buildings, including Parliament, set ablaze.\n\nThe demonstrations started on September 8 over a short-lived social media ban and exacerbated burgeoning popular anger over systemic corruption and poverty.\n\nAt least 72 people died in last week’s violence, the Nepalese authorities said on Sunday.\n\nAfter young activists recommended Karki for the role, the 73-year-old former chief justice was named as the country’s interim leader late on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her first public comments, she said on Sunday that the country should come together to rebuild, promising that she would work “according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation”.\n\n“What this group is demanding is the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality,” she said.\n\nSpeaking from the Civil Service Hospital, Subash Dhakal, a 19-year-old protester who was shot in the knees, said he was proud of his role in bringing about a change in government.\n\n“I have no regrets at all,” he told the AFP news agency.\n\n“I have done it not only for me. It was for everyone, from my family to all brothers. This pain is ephemeral, but this will definitely bring about some changes.”",

      "content": "India boycotts Pakistan across all forums except multinational cricket. And that’s because it stands to lose too much money.\n\nIndia’s most recent encounter with Pakistan in the Asia Cup was celebrated as a patriotic spectacle: a win dedicated to the armed forces and those affected by the Pahalgam attack. Such declarations, however, expose something deeper: a strategy of playing politics with sport, hypocrisy masked as principle.\n\nBeneath this posturing and tokenism lies a contradiction too stark to ignore. This is not just sport. It is cynical theatre in which administrators, players and commentators attempt to ride on two boats at the same time. The hypocrisy is visible to anyone with a sane set of eyes.\n\nAt the heart of this contradiction is the relationship between India and Pakistan in cricket. Officially, India refuses bilateral cricket with Pakistan. The line is firm: no tours, no series and no diplomacy. The justification rests on national security, especially after the clash between the South Asian neighbours in May.\n\nIndian artists are banned from collaborating with their Pakistani counterparts. Pakistani singers and actors once popular in India have been cut off on social media and otherwise. Indian celebrities themselves are trolled and shamed for past collaborations done on neutral grounds.\n\nYet the same ecosystem explodes with excitement when India faces Pakistan in multination tournaments. Matches are packaged as spectacles, marketed as the “greatest rivalry” and cashed in for billions in advertising revenue.\n\nThis duality is not accidental. Jay Shah, now serving in International Cricket Council (ICC) leadership, has been accused of pressuring Team India into playing Pakistan despite reluctance from within the camp. Sanjay Raut, a member of parliament in India, recently alleged that Shah’s hand forced the decision, turning the match into an obligation rather than a choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf true, this signals how far politics has penetrated Indian cricket administration for the sake of money and clout. The game is no longer simply sport but a vehicle for symbolic battles decided in boardrooms, not dressing rooms.\n\nThe hypocrisy becomes sharper when one considers the home environment. While Indians in other spheres faced online lynching for working with Pakistani colleagues even before the war, cricketers are being placed on a pedestal for defeating Pakistan. It is not only about double standards. It is about a calculated exploitation of sentiment.\n\nCricket is permitted as the only arena of “contact” because cricket sells more than most things in India. The ban on cultural exchange is explained as nationalism, but cricket is exempted in the name of multilateral obligations and commercial survival. Dedications of wins to soldiers and terror victims act as moral cover for what is essentially a business transaction. This is sheer hypocrisy and tokenism.\n\nIf India insists on involving politics in sport, consistency demands more. Look at Muslim athletes and countries known for boycotting matches against Israeli opponents. They forfeit games, risk sanctions and face bans. Whatever one thinks of their politics, their actions are clear, uncompromised and costly. They make a stand and face consequences.\n\nIndia refuses bilateral cricket with Pakistan yet plays them in ICC tournaments because the money is too big to lose, especially when most of it comes home through viewership endorsements and advertisements. It tries to sail on two boats, waving nationalism with one hand while collecting profits with the other. The dedication of victories to the armed forces does not erase that contradiction. It exposes it.\n\nThe India-Pakistan rivalry itself is not what it used to be. Competitive balance has tilted drastically. India has dominated recent contests due to the Pakistani team’s poor form. Suspense is long gone, but the manufactured hype remains.\n\nBroadcasters and advertisers pump the match as if it still defines the fate of nations. In reality, it defines the fate of sponsorship deals. The sporting value is hollowed out. The symbolic gestures after each victory only add to the theatre. In their latest match on Sunday, Indian players refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts.\n\nSuch dissonance turns patriotism into branding and erodes the dignity of national discourse. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, the ICC leadership and political voices close to the game must confront this contradiction. Cricket cannot remain both business and battlefield. A rivalry stripped of sporting essence but inflated with symbolism cannot endure. The Pahalgam victims deserve solidarity but should not be used as props for cricketing theatre. Sport deserves freedom from tokenism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of continuing this hybrid model of opportunism, India can opt for one of two choices. It can refuse to play Pakistan entirely, across all formats, including ICC tournaments. That would align deeds with words at the highest level. It would be costly in terms of ICC sanctions and revenues, but it would at least be consistent.\n\nOr India can accept playing Pakistan as part of sport while removing politics and symbolic dedications from the game. That would mean treating cricket as cricket, not as a stage for nationalism.\n\nIndia’s cricket establishment must choose one path. If it wants politics in sport, it must show the courage of consistency. If it wants to keep politics out, it must strip away the hollow dedications and patriotic posturing. The current approach of trying to sail on two boats is not sustainable. It fools no one, neither at home nor abroad. Cricket is being diminished by this hypocrisy and so is national dignity.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

      "description": "A family member says he had turned political recently and hated Kirk. But Robinson&#039;s family is staunchly Republican.",
      "content": "A family member says he had turned political recently and hated Kirk. But Robinson’s family is staunchly Republican.\n\nConservative activist and social media personality Charlie Kirk was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University in the United States on Wednesday.\n\nAfter more than a two-day manhunt, authorities arrested and named 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson as the suspect in Kirk’s shooting.\n\nWhile naming Robinson, authorities said a motive was unknown. Since then, however, politicians and posts on social media platforms have speculated about what might have driven Robinson to allegedly shoot Kirk.\n\nHere is what we know so far about Robinson and potential motives:\n\nWho shot Kirk – and was he a Republican or a Democrat?\n\nOn Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox named Robinson as the person suspected of fatally shooting Kirk.\n\nRobinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St George, Utah.\n\nState records from Utah showed that Robinson is a registered voter in the state, but he is not affiliated with any political party. He did not vote in the two most recent general elections when he was of voting age.\n\nAt the beginning of the hunt for Kirk’s shooter, Utah’s Department of Public Safety released grainy surveillance camera photos of a white man wearing Converse trainers, jeans, a long-sleeved black T-shirt with a US flag and eagle on it, and a black baseball cap with a triangle.\n\nRobinson’s family: What do we know about their politics?\n\nRobinson’s listed address is his parents’ home near St George, about a 3.5-hour drive from Utah Valley University. Robinson’s parents are both registered Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther family members have spoken in news interviews about how the extended family too is Republican. On social media platforms, some of Robinson’s photos show him holding guns.\n\nBut in an affidavit filed by prosecutors against Robinson after his arrest, they said a family member had told them that he had “become more political in recent years”.\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent Robert Bohls described Robinson’s weapon as “a high-powered, bolt-action rifle”.\n\nAccording to the affidavit filed by prosecutors against Robinson on Friday, investigators found a .30-06-calibre, bolt-action Mauser Model 98 rifle wrapped in a dark coloured towel allegedly discarded by Robinson.\n\nWhat drove Robinson to shoot Kirk, according to prosecutors?\n\nWhile prosecutors have not spelled out a motive for Robinson’s alleged act, their affidavit details conversations with the family member who referred to the suspect’s increasingly political turn and to Robinson’s flatmate.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, one of Kirk’s family members told investigators that Robinson had visited for a family dinner before the shooting. While talking to another family member, Robinson had talked about his dislike for Kirk.\n\nThe other family member also echoed Robinson’s dislike, and both individuals said they did not like Kirk’s viewpoints. The family member also said Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.\n\nWhat has Utah’s governor said about Robinson’s possible motivations?\n\nCox, a Republican, told The Wall Street Journal that Robinson was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology“.\n\nCox referenced cryptic messages that prosecutors said were engraved on shell casings recovered with the rifle allegedly used in Kirk’s shooting.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, one fired casing read: “Notices, bulges OWO what’s this?”\n\nThree unfired shell casings also had messages. They read: “hey fascist! CATCH!” with an up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols; a reference to an antifascist Italian folk song, “O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!”; and “If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.”\n\nCox also referenced the sexual identity of Robinson’s flatmate and partner, who the governor said had been cooperating with investigators.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Cox said Robinson’s roommate was transgender, “a male transitioning to female”, who was romantically involved with Robinson.\n\nThe Utah governor said that unlike the suspect’s family and flatmate, Robinson himself was “not cooperating” with the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Robinson’s roommate revealed electronic messages that Robinson sent that could provide more clues about the suspected shooter’s motive.\n\nIn the messages, the sender, named “Tyler”, said he had left a rifle in a bush and had to retrieve it. “Tyler” also wrote that he wrapped the rifle in a towel. The messages also talk about engraving bullets.",

      "title": "Indonesia’s climate ambitions can’t shine in the dark",
      "description": "The Indonesian government cannot pursue an ambitious climate agenda while neglecting its human rights obligations.",
      "content": "On August 28, just before inequality protests spread like wildfire across Indonesia, the police blocked a peaceful climate march on the streets of Jakarta. Indigenous peoples, farmers, fisherfolk and people in wheelchairs carrying fairly innocuous signs that read, “Save the Earth! Save generations!” were pushed back by the police and prevented from reaching the State Palace, a frequent demonstration site.\n\nEven though climate advocates formally notified authorities of the march, held to urge the passage of a Climate Justice Bill, demonstrators still got a small taste of aggressive police tactics. These police tactics turned deadly later in the week in fiery youth-led protests against lawmaker perks, in which at least 10 people were killed and thousands detained.\n\nThere’s no sugarcoating what many Indonesians feel about the recent violence: anger but also dread and fear. We are a nation of survivors, having faced the brutality of a military dictatorship that lasted three decades and killed an estimated 500,000 to one million civilians. Our collective skins bear the scars of authoritarian rule, which still tingle. But we’ve also never allowed guns and tear gas to silence us – which is why civil society has pushed initial demands to scrap lawmaker perks even further.\n\nNow, people no longer want just piecemeal responses that try to put the lid on boiling rage. They want thorough reforms that would address the sources of pent-up anger: low wages and rising costs of living while oligarchs and big corporations bleed the people dry. This is scarcely a new narrative. But as the fiery protests show, people have to draw the line at some point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe climate movement, too, is drawing the line. We too are tired of being ignored while the planet keeps heating up, our rainforests are being cut down, “green” mining is driving Indigenous peoples from their land, and coal plants keep running despite repeated pledges by our leaders to phase them out.\n\nIndonesia is among the world’s top 10 emitters. It is also home to some of the world’s largest – and last remaining – carbon sinks. Both reducing emissions and protecting natural resources are crucial to keeping the planet cool and protecting the people from even more devastating climate impacts.\n\nBut instead of using these resources wisely for wealth redistribution and sustainable national development, our leaders have repeatedly been accessories to corruption and environmental plunder that benefit cronies and big corporations at the expense of the people and the planet.\n\nNext week, President Prabowo Subianto is expected to appear at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. It is the first time in a decade that an Indonesian leader will attend the forum. It is clear that the president wants to make his mark as a global leader of significance. But his ambitions can’t shine in the dark. To earn credibility and prove that his military past does not define his current leadership, he must first ensure that human rights are respected at home.\n\nPrabowo has made exceptionally strong statements on climate commitments. At the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro last year, he announced plans for the early retirement of all coal-fired power plants within 15 years. Even more dramatically, he said in July that Indonesia could achieve 100 percent renewable energy within the next 10 years.\n\nBut more than statements, we need action embodied in concrete plans and ambitious emissions reduction goals. Indonesia’s latest climate pledge, the Second Nationally Determined Contribution, which the government aims to submit before Prabowo’s UN speech, will be a litmus test – just like how he responds to demands for justice and reform.\n\nMeanwhile, as inequality deepens, the climate crisis rages on. Extreme floods, longer droughts and more intense heatwaves may hit us all, but their impacts are not equal. The poor and the working class are the ones suffering the most as they lose their livelihoods, their homes and, now, even their most basic human rights. And unless we act with urgency and courage, our children will inherit a planet where survival itself becomes a privilege, not a right.\n\nThere can be no climate justice without human rights. Whenever there’s injustice, we must put up a good fight – whether it concerns the climate or social injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

They closed Friday slightly lower for 2025 despite a recent rally, with the stock up more than 25% over the last three months.\n\nThese kinds of purchases are rare for Musk with him last buying about 200,000 shares worth around $10 million on Feb. 14, 2020, according to Verity data. It's his largest purchase ever by value, according to Verity.\n\nThe electric vehicle maker earlier this month said it would ask shareholders to approve a new pay package for Musk that could be worth up to $975 billion based on various ambitious milestones. Before the purchases Friday, Musk owned around 13% of Tesla.\n\nTesla shares this year have been weighed down by slumping sales partly tied to Musk's political activities hurting the brand, along with the end of certain incentives for electric vehicles by the Trump administration.\n\nAnalysts are torn on the stock with the consensus price target on Wall Street calling for about a 20% decline from here, according to Tipranks.com. Though many are optimistic over the long term if Musk can pull off a transformation of the company to focus more on autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and robotics. The CEO wants shareholders to approve an investment by Tesla into his latest company, xAI.\n\nThe insider purchase \"is a huge sign of confidence for Tesla bulls and shows Musk is doubling down on his Tesla A.I. bet,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush.\n\nThe pay package shareholders will vote on in November has an ultimate goalpost of an $8.5 trillion market value.

      "description": "Trump said the idea is \"subject to SEC approval\" and would \"save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.\"",
      "content": "President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is \"subject to SEC approval\" and would \"save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear the statement that, 'China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!'\" Trump said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to study the issue but no recommendations came of the matter.\n\nThe wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.\n\n\"In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,\" the pair wrote.\n\nCurrent regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.\n\nLogistically, the move would not require support from Congress but rather just a majority vote on the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a 3-1 voting majority, with one open seat. The process likely would take six to 12 months, said Sarah Bianchi, chief strategist of international political affairs and public policy at Evercore ISI.\n\n\"Administrations have to varying degrees given policy steers to the SEC, and with Trump's directive\n\nthis is now something that has to be taken seriously as a possibility,\" Bianchi, a former U.S. deputy trade representative, said in a note. \"However, the SEC has also historically been able to operate with some measure of independence.\"\n\nSEC Chair Paul Atkins has not spoken on the issue.\n\n\"If the effort at the SEC to reconsider quarterly reporting gains steam, it could also prompt conversations around when and how companies issue guidance and communicate with investors that would have important ramifications for public markets,\" Bianchi added.\n\nSupporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.\n\n\"When you weigh this out and put it on a whiteboard, the pros of quarterly reporting outweigh the cons,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth Management. \"Having to wait six months for official results, I just think would cause more difficulties than it would add benefits.\"\n\nWhile executives have come under some criticism for reporting misleading earnings, the use of generally accepted accounting principles — GAAP — has helped provide guardrails that ensure standardization. For that reason, U.S. reporting is considered among the most transparent and reliable in the world.\n\nDespite Trump's comments about China, companies there have reporting requirements that are similar to the U.S. if not more stringent. Chinese companies must file quarterly earnings reports as well as semiannual and annual reports.\n\nCompanies listed on the Hong Kong exchange, however, only report every six months.\n\nTrump's proposal would be more in line with practices in the U.K. and European Union, where companies are required to file semiannually but can issue quarterly reports if they choose.\n\nBut Hogan said the comparison between U.S. and European companies isn't valid.\n\n\"How many companies in the European markets have trillion-dollar market caps and are growing revenues at 60% a year or have gross margins that are north of 50%?\" he said. \"The investor is better suited to having more information than less or more frequent information.\n\nEarlier this year, Norway's sovereign wealth fund proposed switching to semiannual reporting, reasoning that lengthening the time frame would allow companies to focus on the longer term. The Long-Term Stock Exchange trading platform also has supported less frequent reporting.\n\nThe White House declined further comment on Trump's post. CNBC has reached out to the SEC for comment.\n\n(Learn the best 2026 strategies from inside the NYSE with Josh Brown and others at CNBC PRO Live. Tickets and info here.)",

      "content": "In this article KLAR Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nSpecialist traders work at the post for Swedish fintech Klarna, during the company’s IPO at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Sept. 10, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nAfter Swedish payments group Klarna's $17 billion initial public offering, investors are pondering which big fintech name will be the next to go public. Klarna popped as much as 30% on the day of its New York IPO, before settling to close around 15% higher. The stock declined further to $42.92 by Friday but is still up about 7% from its IPO price of $40. The debut demonstrated how Wall Street is becoming more welcoming of bumper fintech listings. Prior to Klarna, online trading platform eToro, stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish all went public to a positive first-day reception. Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, surged 14% in its IPO Friday. \"I think the Klarna IPO would be viewed positively by some of the other scaled-up vendors,\" Gautam Pillai, head of fintech research at British investment bank Peel Hunt, told CNBC. There's a crowded pipeline of fintech names that could be next to IPO after Klarna. CNBC looks at which companies look the most promising.\n\nStripe\n\nPatrick Collison, chief executive officer and co-founder of Stripe Inc., left, smiles as John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Studio 1.0 television interview in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Friday, March 23, 2018. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDigital payments firm Stripe has for years been viewed as an IPO contender. Stripe has remained a private company in the 15 years since it was founded, and founders and brothers John and Patrick Collison have long resisted pressure to take the business public. However, that doesn't mean a stock market listing hasn't been on Stripe's mind. The Collisons told employees in 2023 that Stripe would decide to either go public or allow employees to sell shares via a secondary offering within the next year. Ultimately, Stripe in January opted for a secondary share sale valuing the company at $91.5 billion — close to its peak valuation of $95 billion, which it achieved in 2021. That doesn't mean Stripe couldn't still pursue a stock market debut further down the line. Many fintech unicorn CEOs have been keeping a close eye on Klarna's IPO performance for signs of when will be the right moment to list.\n\nRevolut\n\nRevolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, Nov. 7, 2019. Pedro Nunes | Reuters\n\nRevolut is widely seen as a potential future fintech IPO candidate. The digital banking unicorn told CNBC last week that it recently gave employees the chance to sell shares on the secondary market at a whopping $75 billion valuation, placing it above some major U.K. banks by market value. \"As part of our commitment to our employees, we regularly provide opportunities for them to gain liquidity,\" a Revolut spokesperson told CNBC at the time. \"An employee secondary share sale is currently in process, and we won't be commenting further until it is complete.\" The secondary round buys Revolut some time to remain private for longer while still offering staff the chance to exit some of their holdings. At the same time, though, it now makes Revolut one of the world's most valuable private fintech firms. As to where Revolut lists, for now the U.S. appears the likeliest location. Co-founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky has spoken candidly about his preference to list in the U.S. due to issues with London's IPO market. Last year, he told the 20VC podcast that it was \"just not rational\" to go public in the U.K.\n\nMonzo\n\nMonzo CEO TS Anil. Monzo\n\nHaving recently reached a $5.9 billion valuation in a secondary share sale, British digital bank Monzo is another contender for the public markets. A report surfaced earlier this year from Sky News that said Monzo had lined up bankers to work on an IPO that could take place as early as the first half of 2026. However, in a fireside discussion moderated by CNBC at SXSW London, Monzo CEO TS Anil said that an IPO is \"not the thing we're focused on right now\" — it's worth noting though that this was back in June. \"The thing we're focused on is scale the business, continue to grow it, double it again, reach more customers, build more products, continue to drive great economic outcomes on the back of that,\" Anil said at the time. Anil wouldn't comment on where Monzo would list if it were to IPO, but he stressed the firm was \"deeply committed\" to being globally headquartered in London.\n\nStarling Bank\n\nRaman Bhatia, incoming chief executive officer of Starling. Bhatia moved over from OVO Energy Ltd., where he was CEO. Zed Jameson | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMonzo's rival neobank Starling Bank has reportedly been considering an initial public offering in the U.S. as part of expansion plans there. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Starling had hired Jody Bhagat, former president of global banking at software firm Personetics Technologies, to lead the growth of its Engine technology unit in the U.S. Starling declined to comment when asked by CNBC about its listing plans. Last year, Starling's CEO Raman Bhatia talked up the bank's plans to expand globally via Engine, a software platform that Starling sells to other companies so they can set up their own digital banks. \"I am very bullish about this approach around internationalization of what is the best of Starling — the proprietary tech,\" Bhatia said during a fireside chat at the Money 20/20 conference moderated by CNBC. Starling was last privately valued at £2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in a 2022 funding round. However, reports indicate the firm is looking to fetch a valuation of £4 billion in an upcoming secondary share sale.\n\nPayhawk\n\nSaravutvanset | Room | Getty Images\n\nThough a lesser known name, Bulgaria-founded fintech firm Payhawk also has IPO ambitions. The spend management platform was valued at $1 billion in 2022 and saw revenue surge 85% year-over-year in 2024 to 23.4 million euros ($27.4 million). \"We're definitely seeing the IPO window open,\" Payhawk CEO and co-founder Hristo Borisov told CNBC in an interview earlier this month. However, he stressed that \"we are looking at more of a five-year horizon there.\" \"If you look at the majority of the IPOs, the majority of those IPOs are companies with $400 million to $500 million-plus ARR [annual recurring revenue],\" Borisov said. \"That's our goal.\"\n\nSome honorary mentions",

      "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed a plethora of moral and ethical questions regarding his company and its AI chatbot in a sweeping interview with Tucker Carlson.",
      "content": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and Lisa Su, CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, testify during the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing titled \"Winning the AI Race: Strengthening U.S. Capabilities in Computing and Innovation,\" in Hart building on Thursday, May 8, 2025. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\n\nIn a sweeping interview last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed a plethora of moral and ethical questions regarding his company and the popular ChatGPT AI model. \"Look, I don't sleep that well at night. There's a lot of stuff that I feel a lot of weight on, but probably nothing more than the fact that every day, hundreds of millions of people talk to our model,\" Altman told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a nearly hour-long interview. \"I don't actually worry about us getting the big moral decisions wrong,\" Altman said, though he admitted \"maybe we will get those wrong too.\" Rather, he said he loses the most sleep over the \"very small decisions\" on model behavior, which can ultimately have big repercussions. These decisions tend to center around the ethics that inform ChatGPT, and what questions the chatbot does and doesn't answer. Here's an outline of some of those moral and ethical dilemmas that appear to be keeping Altman awake at night.\n\nHow does ChatGPT address suicide?\n\nAccording to Altman, the most difficult issue the company is grappling with recently is how ChatGPT approaches suicide, in light of a lawsuit from a family who blamed the chatbot for their teenage son's suicide. The CEO said that out of the thousands of people who commit suicide each week, many of them could possibly have been talking to ChatGPT in the lead-up. \"They probably talked about [suicide], and we probably didn't save their lives,\" Altman said candidly. \"Maybe we could have said something better. Maybe we could have been more proactive. Maybe we could have provided a little bit better advice about, hey, you need to get this help.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nLast month, the parents of Adam Raine filed a product liability and wrongful death suit against OpenAI after their son died by suicide at age 16. In the lawsuit, the family said that \"ChatGPT actively helped Adam explore suicide methods.\" Soon after, in a blog post titled \"Helping people when they need it most,\" OpenAI detailed plans to address ChatGPT's shortcomings when handling \"sensitive situations,\" and said it would keep improving its technology to protect people who are at their most vulnerable.\n\nHow are ChatGPT's ethics determined?\n\nAnother large topic broached in the sit-down interview was the ethics and morals that inform ChatGPT and its stewards. While Altman described the base model of ChatGPT as trained on the collective experience, knowledge and learnings of humanity, he said that OpenAI must then align certain behaviors of the chatbot and decide what questions it won't answer. \"This is a really hard problem. We have a lot of users now, and they come from very different life perspectives... But on the whole, I have been pleasantly surprised with the model's ability to learn and apply a moral framework.\" When pressed on how certain model specifications are decided, Altman said the company had consulted \"hundreds of moral philosophers and people who thought about ethics of technology and systems.\" An example he gave of a model specification made was that ChatGPT will avoid answering questions on how to make biological weapons if prompted by users. \"There are clear examples of where society has an interest that is in significant tension with user freedom,\" Altman said, though he added the company \"won't get everything right, and also needs the input of the world\" to help make these decisions.\n\nHow private is ChatGPT?\n\nAnother big discussion topic was the concept of user privacy regarding chatbots, with Carlson arguing that generative AI could be used for \"totalitarian control.\" In response, Altman said one piece of policy he has been pushing for in Washington is \"AI privilege,\" which refers to the idea that anything a user says to a chatbot should be completely confidential. \"When you talk to a doctor about your health or a lawyer about your legal problems, the government cannot get that information, right?... I think we should have the same concept for AI.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nAccording to Altman, that would allow users to consult AI chatbots about their medical history and legal problems, among other things. Currently, U.S. officials can subpoena the company for user data, he added. \"I think I feel optimistic that we can get the government to understand the importance of this,\" he said.\n\nWill ChatGPT be used in military operations?\n\nAsked by Carlson if ChatGPT would be used by the military to harm humans, Altman didn't provide a direct answer. \"I don't know the way that people in the military use ChatGPT today... but I suspect there's a lot of people in the military talking to ChatGPT for advice.\" Later, he added that he wasn't sure \"exactly how to feel about that.\" OpenAI was one of the AI companies that received a $200 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to put generative AI to work for the U.S. military. The firm said in a blog post that it would provide the U.S. government access to custom AI models for national security, support and product roadmap information.\n\nJust how powerful is OpenAI?\n\nCarlson, in his interview, predicted that on its current trajectory, generative AI and by extension, Sam Altman, could amass more power than any other person, going so far as to call ChatGPT a \"religion.\" In response, Altman said he used to worry a lot about the concentration of power that could result from generative AI, but he now believes that AI will result in \"a huge up leveling\" of all people.\n\nGet a weekly round up of the top tech stories from around the world in your inbox every Friday.

      "description": "Fitch downgraded France's credit rating on Friday, and analysts say other agencies could follow suit.",
      "content": "A protester brandishes a smoke flame by a barricade on fire during a demonstration part of the \"Bloquons tout\" (\"Let's block everything\") protest movement, in the south east of Paris, on September 10, 2025. The broad anti-government campaign, dubbed \"Bloquons tout\" (\"Let's block everything\"), calls for a ahutdown of France on September 10 with a string of protest actions and civil disobedience around the country. Alain Jocard | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFrance's borrowing costs ticked higher on Monday as traders reacted to Fitch's decision Friday to downgrade the country's credit rating amid ongoing uncertainty over the country's political leadership. Fitch downgraded France's credit rating from 'AA-' to 'A+' with a stable outlook, citing a \"high and rising debt ratio\" and warning that \"political fragmentation\" was hindering fiscal consolidation. On Monday morning, the yield on France's benchmark 10-year government bond initially moved 7 basis points higher to 3.5132% at 7.40 a.m. London time, whereas the yield on the 30-year bond , or OATs as they're called in France, rose 8 basis points to 4.3351%.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nBoth yields have since retreated in early deals, and were broadly flat around 9:13 a.m. London time, perhaps reflecting the fact that credit rating downgrades were expected in the days after the collapse of former Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government on Monday following a confidence vote. Cognisant of the wary and weary eyes of investors — who have followed more than a year of tumult in French politics amid stark disagreements about the 2026 budget — French President Emmanuel Macron quickly elected a new prime minister, France's fifth in less than two years. Whether his ally, former Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, will fare any better as PM remains to be seen, with analysts predicting he will face the same opposition to spending cuts and tax rises (Bayrou had targeted 44 billion euros, or $51.5 billion, worth of cuts), necessary to reduce France's budget deficit. There was no honeymoon period for Lecornu, with protests erupting on the day he was sworn in as PM, and more union-backed demonstrations due this week, with major disruption expected on Thursday.\n\nwatch now\n\nFor its part, Fitch projected that France's fiscal deficit would stand at 5.5% of gross domestic product in 2025, down from 5.8% of GDP in 2024, but warned this was still high compared with the projected euro zone median deficit of 2.7%. In addition, Fitch forecast that French debt would increase to 121% of GDP in 2027 from 113.2% in 2024, \"without a clear horizon for debt stabilisation in subsequent years.\"\n\nMore downgrades ahead?\n\nWorrying for France, Fitch's latest appraisal of France's credit-worthiness was the first of several rating reviews on the horizon. Moody's is due to announce its latest review of the risks associated with investing in the nation's debt on Oct. 24, and Standard and Poor's (S&P) is expected on Nov. 28.",

      "content": "China's economic slowdown deepened in August with a raft of key indicators missing expectations, as weak domestic demand persisted and Beijing's campaign against industrial overcapacity curbed output.\n\nRetail sales last month rose 3.4% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday, missing analysts' estimates for 3.9% growth in a Reuters poll and slowing from July's 3.7% growth.\n\nIndustrial output growth slowed to 5.2% in August, compared to the 5.7% jump in July, marking its weakest level since August 2024, according to LSEG data. Economists had expected the data to be unchanged from the previous month.\n\nFixed-asset investment, reported on a year-to-date basis, expanded just 0.5%, a sharp slowdown from the 1.6% expansion in the January to July period, and undershooting economists' forecasts for 1.4% growth.\n\nWithin that segment, the contraction in real estate investment worsened, slumping 12.9% in the first eight months, government data showed. Investment in the manufacturing and utilities sector — including electricity, fuel and water supplies — increased 5.1% and 18.8% from a year earlier, respectively.\n\nFixed-asset investments have been largely propped up by state-owned enterprises, with investments from the private sector contracting from a year earlier, said Yuhan Zhang, principal economist at think-tank The Conference Board's China Center.\n\nInvestments in manufacturing overall have seen \"modest and uneven growth,\" Zhang added, mainly supported by policy-driven state investment in infrastructure, high-tech and industrial upgrading, while real estate activity remains weak.",

The day will end with a state banquet, during which both the king and president will make speeches.\n\nOn Thursday, it's down to business.\n\nTrump will head to Chequers, the country house of sitting U.K. prime ministers, where he'll meet Keir Starmer for a series of bilateral meetings, followed by a joint press conference later that day.\n\nFrom a foreign policy perspective, the timing is awkward.\n\nStarmer has just fired the U.K.'s U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson, citing fresh details over his connections with disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Downing Street had pinned much hope on Mandelson to reinvigorate the \"special relationship\" between the two nations.\n\nInterestingly, just two weeks ago, the Telegraph reported that Trump had invited Mandelson's predecessor, Karen Pierce, to this week's state banquet, in a sign that trouble may already have been brewing.",

      "description": "With a fall rate cut looking likely now, households may finally get some relief from the sky-high borrowing costs — depending on a few key financial moves.",
      "content": "watch now\n\n1. Pay down high-interest debt\n\n\"Rate cuts are welcome news for Americans with debt, but one small reduction won't make much difference when bills come due,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst. With a rate cut, the prime rate lowers, too, and the interest rates on variable-rate debt — most notably credit cards — are likely to follow. But even then, APRs will only ease off extremely high levels. \"Borrowers should get some relief in the coming months, although it's worth pointing out that interest rates are still elevated,\" said Ted Rossman, Bankrate's senior industry analyst. \"Especially credit cards, which carry an average rate of 20.13%.\" That means that if the central bank cuts rates by a quarter point, it won't have a significant impact on your credit card rate. \"Existing borrowers could see their rates go down by half a point or so,\" Rossman said.\n\nRather than wait for a small adjustment in the months ahead, borrowers could switch now to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidate and pay off high-interest credit cards with a personal loan, experts often say. \"For people who have high-interest debt — credit cards or double-digit interest on car loans — that is the priority, you want to target that as much as possible,\" said Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and financial analyst at Bankrate. Although auto loan rates are fixed for the life of the loan, ballooning payments have become another pain point for consumers. Experts say many car shoppers could benefit from paying down revolving debt and improving their credit scores, which could pave the way to even better loan terms in the future.\n\n2. Put your savings to work\n\nSince rates on online savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit are also poised to go down with a Fed rate cut, experts say this is the time to secure some of the best returns available. \"Many high-yield savings accounts and CDs currently offer rates over 4% — more than 10 times the national average,\" said Swati Bhatia, head of retail banking at Santander Bank. Even once the Fed lowers interest rates, savers can still benefit from those competitive rates, especially with a CD, which allows them to lock in a higher interest rate for a set term, she said.\n\nJohner Images | Johner Images Royalty-free | Getty Images\n\nA typical saver with about $8,000 in a checking or savings account could earn an additional $320 a year by moving that money into a CD or high-yield account that earns an interest rate of 4% or more, according to a recent survey by Santander Bank. Still, many Americans keep their savings in traditional accounts, Santander found, which FDIC data shows are currently paying 0.39%, on average.\n\n3. Consider making a big move\n\n\"The housing market would be the biggest beneficiary of lower rates as they would unlock frozen sales by homeowners who are reluctant to give up the low-rate mortgages taken out in the decade following the Great Recession,\" Bob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email. Although mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the economy, they've already come down significantly from their peak at over 7% back in January. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is now just under 6.3% as of Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\n\"Over the last several weeks, the consumer sentiment around mortgages has become a little healthier, we are starting to see some nice momentum,\" said John Hummel, head of retail home lending at U.S. Bank. As more potential home buyers enter the market, that frees up more inventory, Hummel added. And, \"if we see some additional rate cuts, that bodes well as we get into the later half of the year.\"\n\n4. Improve your credit score\n\nUltimately, across virtually all consumer products, those with better credit will qualify for the best loan terms at the lowest interest rate. Boosting your credit score largely comes down to paying your bills on time every month, keeping balances low and only applying for credit as needed, according to Tommy Lee, senior director of scores and predictive analytics at FICO. As a general rule, keep revolving debt below 30% of available credit and \"don't go out and open 10 credit cards,\" Lee said.\n\nwatch now",

      "description": "More drivers are rolling negative equity into new car loans. Here’s how to minimize the cost as much as possible in this situation, experts say.",
      "content": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty Images\n\nHow drivers end up 'underwater'\n\nTo be sure, it's not unusual to see underwater auto loans. You may already be underwater on your loan from the moment you drive out of the dealer with the new vehicle, as cars are depreciating assets, said Brian Moody, senior staff writer at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. But other choices you make, such as taking on a longer loan term or making a smaller down payment, can exacerbate the issue.\n\nwatch now\n\nStill, lengthening an auto loan's terms is \"the one thing consumers can do to decrease costs,\" said Drury. It has gotten to the point where 84-month auto loans have become \"increasingly common,\" he said. In the second quarter of 2025, 84-month auto loans comprised of 21.6% of new auto loans, up from 19.2% the quarter prior, according to Edmunds data provided to CNBC. To compare, 72-month loans were at 36.1% in the second quarter, down from 38.6% in the same timeframe, according to the data. It isn't a problem to have negative equity when you still own and drive the car, Moody said. It becomes an issue when you need to sell or trade it in. Negative equity can also be problematic if your vehicle is totaled. After an accident, your insurer will typically pay the actual cash value of the car. If that's less than what you owe on your loan, you're responsible for the remaining cost.\n\nHow to buy a new car when you're underwater\n\nKeep your current vehicle if you can, experts say, to avoid having to roll that debt into a new loan or come up with cash to cover it. If you truly need a new car, it's important to do preliminary research before you even walk into a car dealership. If you have negative equity from a prior auto loan, rolling it over to a lower-interest car loan can help you save on borrowing costs, Drury said. First, understand what your credit score is, said Moody. Generally speaking, the higher your score, the better the interest rate and loan terms lenders offer you. \"Knowing your credit score and knowing what interest rate you qualify for is important to know upfront,\" Moody said. Try to get pre-approved for different auto loans across several banks or lenders, said Drury. This helps you get a better gauge of the terms you can qualify for and distinguish the best offers. Once you're ready to buy, the auto dealer might either try to match the deals you have or offer better financing options, he said.",

      "description": "\"Trust can catch fire or die out right away, all due to small signals in those first seconds of an interaction,\" writes psychology expert Vanessa Van Edwards.",
      "content": "The worst thing you can ask at the start of any interaction is: \"How are you?\" You're essentially telling the other person that the interaction will be like every other interaction. They'll most likely respond, \"My day's been busy. Good but busy.\" It's boring and generates a social script. I've spent the last 17 years studying human behavior and what sparks connections between strangers. I've learned that trust can catch fire or die out right away, all due to small signals in those first seconds of an interaction. Here's what to do if you really want to instantly gain trust.\n\n1. Skip the boring scripts\n\nDon't ask what everyone else is asking, like \"What's up?\" or \"Been busy lately?\" Try a question that's still casual, but looking for excitement. This sets you up for a better interaction. A few examples: Don't ask: \"How's it going?\" Instead, ask: \"What's the highlight of your week so far?\"\n\nDon't ask: \"Have you been keeping busy?\" Instead, ask: \"Any big wins lately?\"\n\nDon't ask: \"Working on anything lately?\" Instead, ask: \"Working on anything exciting these days?\" DON'T MISS: How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work\n\n2. Look for the joy in their lives\n\nIf you want to generate trust with anyone, encourage them to tell stories about their lives. Be known for asking others what they are most looking forward to. Here's my trick: On Mondays and Tuesdays, I ask everyone, \"Did you do anything fun this past weekend?\"\n\nOn Thursdays and Fridays, I modify it to, \"Are you doing anything fun this upcoming weekend?\"\n\nOn Wednesdays, I ask, \"Working on anything fun or exciting this week?\"\n\nBefore any holiday or break, I ask, \"Looking forward to anything fun for the holidays?\" Everyone on my team and in my life knows I'm going to be asking for fun or exciting plans, so they save them up to tell me all about them (or avoid me when life is boring). It's a win-win!\n\n3. How to answer when someone asks 'How are you?'\n\nWhen it comes to building trust, it isn't just the questions you ask, but how you respond when someone tries to connect with you, too. The biggest mistake I see people make is that when they start conversations, they immediately lead with negativity: \"Ugh this terrible weather!\" or \"My schedule has been crazy!\" Instead, save one interesting thing to lead with and be ready when someone asks you a boring question. The next time someone asks, \"How are you?\" try to respond with some humor or whimsy instead. You might try a reply like: \"Good enough that I remembered to floss. So, a win.\"\n\n\"Running on caffeine and a dream.\"\n\n\"10 of 10 today, I just got one new follower on Instagram.\"\n\n\"Hanging in there like a cat on a motivational poster.\" Essentially, anything other than the standard \"Busy, but good\" will wake people up.\n\n4. Your body language matters as much as your words\n\nWords matter, but your body talks louder. Keep arms uncrossed and face them square to seem open. An open stance invites reciprocity; a closed one sparks doubt. A solid handshake — one to three pumps, firm but easy — says you're sure of yourself and can even signal your personality traits. On video calls, lean in a bit to close the gap. If they nod, try nodding back. Matching or mirroring their body signals tells their brain you're safe.\n\n5. Practice in your everyday life",

      "description": "For Panama Canal, drought is an economic and existential risk. New dam and land bridge projects will help trade move, but won't be ready before next El Niño.",
      "content": "After a historic drought that paralyzed vessel transits through the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Authority is moving ahead with major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate future droughts and the risk of low water levels that in recent years plagued the key global trade gateway.\n\nThe Panama Canal depends on fresh water for its operations and is rainfall dependent.\n\n\"We use about two and a half times the amount of water a city of the size of New York uses for the canal operation,\" Ricaurte Vásquez, Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC.\n\nIn a good year of rain, that means over 50 vessel transits through the canal's locks a day, but in recent years, weather has not cooperated. Severe drought conditions hit the region from late 2022 to 2024, forcing the canal to reduce transits and put in place vessel weight restrictions in an effort to conserve water.\n\nThe canal is critical to the U.S. economy and trade. The U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal, with total U.S. commodity export and import containers representing about 73% of Panama Canal traffic, and 40% of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year. In all, roughly $270 billion in cargo is handled annually.\n\nIn April, Canal administration began the pre-qualification and selection process for concessionaires to build a land bridge, including what it describes as a flagship natural gas pipeline line to move natural gas liquids (NGLs) without relying on the canal itself. A road connecting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as port terminals built on either coast, would also be constructed, with the terminals also able to accommodate containers and roll-on and roll-off cargo.\n\nThe pipeline would allow for the transport of liquified petroleum gas, ethane, butane, and propane from the Atlantic side to a Pacific-side terminal, where another vessel would be loaded and carry the product to Asia. Canal officials hope this will attract more LNG transits through the canal.\n\nThe Panama Canal Authority reported a 29% drop in vessel transits during fiscal year 2024, with the biggest hits in LNG and dry bulk transits. LNG transits were down 66 percent, while dry bulk transits were down 107 percent.\n\nEven though water levels are back to regular operating conditions, LNG traffic has not returned to pre-drought transit activity, with carriers continuing to choose the longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, according to S&P Global data.\n\nVasquez tells CNBC that U.S. energy companies are \"drooling at the possibilities\" of this alternative way to move the commodity. Transit time-wise, Vasquez said the pipeline would be competitive versus traversing the canal, and reliability would be higher because it is now water-dependent. \"This is important because with many of these products, reliability and delivering on time are critical,\" he said.\n\n\"We decided to do a land bridge to complement the waterway,\" Vásquez said. \"We are aware that these are high-value products that have a destination in Asia,\" he said, noting the project was announced in Tokyo, which is the largest buyer of these energy products.",

It was the first I was hearing of the change. Since I finished graduate school in 2017, my servicer has been Nelnet.\n\n\"The U.S. Department of Education (ED) authorized the transfer of your federal student loan(s) from Nelnet to CRI,\" the message said.\n\nI searched through my emails to see if I'd missed a message about the transfer of my loans, but I couldn't find one. Finally, I realized that I had received notice of the upcoming change in my Nelnet account inbox (which I don't remember ever checking). The letter was posted in mid-July.\n\nAfter I created a new account with CRI, or Central Research, Inc., as the message instructed me to do, I panicked when I saw that my loans had been placed in an administrative forbearance. I'd never requested that my loan payments be put on pause, and I've written extensively about how costly these reprieves can be, thanks to the accrual of interest.\n\nI couldn't figure out how long my loans were in that status, and why my next due date wasn't until the end of October.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nHow to get a better mortgage rate as the 30-year fixed nears 1-year low\n\nHere's how to handle your student loans after losing a job\n\nGold is on a record run — here's how to invest\n\nOther borrowers are also reporting their student debt has recently been transferred, with similar headaches, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.\n\n\"CRI is a relatively new servicer, and it seems that ED is slowly transferring accounts from other servicers to them,\" Nierman told me.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education contracts with different companies to service its over $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio, including Mohela, Nelnet and EdFinancial. It pays the servicers more than $1 billion a year to manage roughly 42 million borrowers' accounts, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\n\nI spoke to experts about what borrowers — me included — should know and do if their federal student loans are transferred from one company to another.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education, Nelnet and CRI did not respond to a request for comment.",

With Lossless audio now finally rolling out to paying subscribers, the music streaming service has announced that it’s also allowing non-paying listeners to search, play, and share any song they want, without having to upgrade to a Premium subscription.\n\nThe update is being rolled out globally and addresses one of the most annoying limitations of Spotify’s shuffle-only free experience. Instead of playing the specific song a free user had searched for or selected in an album or playlist, Spotify would previously launch tracks in a randomized order that forced users to skip songs until they reached the one they actually wanted to play, with skips limited to six per hour.\n\nNow, non-paying users can “pick and play any song you want,” according to Spotify. There are still some restrictions in place, however, with CNET reporting that free users can only listen to one song before the app starts shuffling, and an undisclosed limit on how many on-demand minutes a user has per day, according to Music Business Worldwide. We’ve reached out to Spotify for comment and will update if the company responds.\n\nThe free experience will also still include ads, but this update gives free listeners fewer reasons to use rival streaming services like YouTube when they want to play a specific song without dancing around shuffle-skipping requirements. This also helps Spotify’s desire to get users sharing music links online, given that non-paying users previously couldn’t immediately play songs that friends had shared on social media platforms.",

      "content": "Google Gemini is breaking out of ChatGPT’s shadow, likely on the wings of its Nano Banana image editor and the viral trend of AI-generated, lifelike figurines.\n\nGoogle launched Nano Banana in late August. It hyped the model as a way to “transform images in amazing new ways” inside the Gemini app. To get the “perfect picture,” you simply pop an image into Gemini and “tell it what you’d like to change,” the company said. Google’s suggestions include redecorating your house, giving yourself a ’60s beehive, putting a tutu on your chihuahua, and seeing how many wrinkles you’ll have acquired in 10 years. You can also combine different pictures and create a “fun video” of your new reality by plugging the finished product back into Gemini.\n\nOn X, Gemini and Google Labs vice president Josh Woodward said the Gemini app had added 23 million users in the two weeks since the editing model launched. In the same time, he said Gemini has been used to transform 500 million images.\n\nThe surge has likely propelled Gemini to the top of various app stores around the world. At the time of writing, Gemini is the leading iPhone app on Apple’s App Stores in the US, UK, Canada, France, Australia, Germany, and Italy. In many cases, it reached the prime position by surpassing OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which now sits in second place.\n\nOn September 11th, Woodward said “India has found” the image editor and later said that Google was going to have to implement “temporary limits” on usage in order to manage extreme demand. “It’s a full-on stampede to use” Gemini, he said, adding that the “team is doing heroics to keep the system up and running.”\n\nSo, what’s driving the surge? While a variety of edits have been popular, the runaway hit of Nano Banana has people turning themselves — or their pets — into 3D figurines. All you need to do is to give Gemini an image of yourself and some pretty detailed instructions to get a realistic miniature doll version of yourself on a desktop, complete with a box that it presumably came in and a wire-frame model presumably used to design it flashing on a computer screen behind it. While the prompt is detail-heavy, easily copied versions have spread online. Google has even supplied its own in order to keep the trend going.\n\nAfter playing around with Nano Banana for a bit, it’s easy to see how Google has earned its viral AI moment. The image editor is simple and convenient to use inside the Gemini app. It’s also fast, with little of the waiting around for images that has turned me off other tools like ChatGPT. To be clear, there are still issues that frustrate me. Like other image apps, the results are not always what I imagined, and Gemini sometimes decided to just ignore my prompt entirely and return my image with no changes.\n\nDespite my troubles, there is one element of Nano Banana’s editing capabilities that amused me enough to think it has earned its time in the spotlight and will likely spawn a few new viral trends before a better model takes its place: the images that it gave me still look like me. While many AI editing tools have been infuriating for their tendency to change facial features and create creepy facsimiles of the original, Google’s Nano Banana swiftly returned a cutesy desktop doll that was still quite recognizably me.",

Musk bought $1 billion in Tesla stock through an irrevocable trust on September 12th, according to a regulatory filing released Monday. Tesla shares were trading up over 5 percent on the news, pushing the company’s value into positive territory for the year.\n\nIt was Musk’s first open-market purchase of Tesla stock in over five years, according to Bloomberg. He offloaded more than $20 billion of the company’s shares in 2022, which was the year he acquired Twitter. Other Tesla executives have similarly sold off some of their shares this year, including several board members.\n\nThe purchase comes more than a week after Tesla’s board proposed a pay package that, if enacted, would make Musk the world’s first trillionaire. Musk would need to meet a series of ambitious milestones to receive the compensation, including producing over a million robots, a million robotaxis, and creating $7.5 trillion in value for Tesla’s shareholders.\n\nIt was Musk’s first open-market purchase of Tesla stock in over five years.\n\nMusk is currently Tesla’s largest shareholder, with a 13 percent stake in the company. But the CEO has said that he wants more control over the company in order to have more sway over its mission — which the board’s plans aims to produce. Musk’s purchase of 2.57 million shares last week increases his stake in Tesla by less than 1 percent.\n\nTesla’s stock price has been on a rollercoaster this year, as rising competition in the EV market combined with Musk’s political activities have weighed on the once high-flying company. The company’s share of the EV market in the US slipped below 40 percent recently, as EV sales continue to slow and other models lure buyers away.\n\nMusk is betting the company’s future on AI and robotics, recently releasing a new master plan that appears to downplay Tesla’s core business of making and selling electric cars. But he has also cautioned that the company could be in for a “few rough quarters” as the US government phases out EV incentives and sales are expected to fall even more.",

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nThe US and China have reached a “framework” deal to divest TikTok from its Chinese parent company, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters during trade talks in Madrid on Monday. As noted by Reuters, Bessent confirmed that “the framework is for a switch to a U.S.-controlled ownership.” He said Trump will confirm the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday — two days after the latest deadline to sell or ban the app.\n\nThe preliminary deal comes after months of rocky negotiations between TikTok and the Trump administration. The app faced a ban in January, but President Donald Trump granted TikTok an extension to work out a deal to sell its operations in the US, as required by the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Trump granted TikTok two more extensions after that, giving it until September 17th to reach an agreement. It’s unknown whether he will formally extend the deadline or consider this announcement sufficient to count as a divestiture; it’s also unclear whether the deal will satisfy the requirements laid out in the law.\n\nBessent told reporters that the US and China are “very close” to reaching a deal, but that China had some “very aggressive asks,” according to The New York Times. (The parties were close to a deal earlier this year too, but it fell through thanks to Trump’s trade war.) In July, reports from The Information and Reuters suggested that Oracle and several other investors, including Susquehanna International Group and Andreessen Horowitz, would make a bid for TikTok, while its China-owned parent company, ByteDance, would get a minority stake. TikTok is reportedly working on a new version of the app with an algorithm trained only on data from US users.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the meeting between China and the US went “VERY WELL,” adding that “a deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.”",

The 990 Evo Plus can achieve sequential read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s, and write at up to 6,300MB/s.

      "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nHello, and welcome to Decoder! This is Hank Green, the cofounder of Complexly, where we make SciShow, Crash Course, and a bunch of other educational YouTube channels. I’m back in the Decoder guest host chair for another couple of episodes while Nilay is out on parental leave.\n\nToday, I’m talking with Digitas CEO Amy Lanzi, who runs a major marketing and ad agency. You might remember Amy; Nilay interviewed her for Decoder live at an event in New York City almost a year ago. But Nilay, who runs what might be called the last website on Earth, has a very different perspective on the world of digital marketing than I do. So, as a career YouTuber, I had a lot of questions for someone in a position like Amy’s.\n\nI’ve been making videos on the internet for close to two decades now, and all the while, I’ve relied on advertising for a healthy chunk of the revenue my channels take in. I also run an e-commerce site, Good.Shop, and then, of course, my big online education brand, Complexly.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nOne might think I’m a marketing and advertising expert. But this stuff is really, really complicated — almost like they’re trying to make it that way, and, frankly, there is a whole lot of it that I do not understand. For a lot of us, I suspect the world of digital marketing is a bit of a mystery. So, I was happy to have Amy really break down how some of this works and why her industry feels like it sits at the center of almost everything that happens on the internet today.\n\nOn the surface, this all sounds pretty simple. You build a brand, you try to create a story around that brand so people associate ideas and loyalties and all sorts of other warm fuzzy feelings with the brand, and then you show them some ads to sell products or experiences or subscriptions or whatever it is you sell. But I know from experience that that is far from the whole story. And as you’ll hear Amy say, that old-school Mad Men-style of advertising is really a relic of the past.\n\nToday, marketing and advertising are increasingly digital and diversified, spread out across a lot of different channels and coming in all shapes and sizes. The ads you see are different from the ones I see, and the ways that brands market themselves online can involve everything from brand deals with creators like me, big TV and movie promotion tie-ins, and then really analytics-driven, algorithmic tech stuff that can feel almost impenetrable to the average person.\n\nYet, as you’ll hear Amy lay out, there is still a huge, expensive draw for what you might call a collective shared experience, something that resonates with a lot of different people all at once. Like, say, a Super Bowl commercial that plays on TV — even if more people might watch it after the fact on YouTube.\n\nThere’s also the AI of it all, which really seems like it’s on a collision course with both the creator economy and the entire economic structure of the open web. I know this because Nilay can’t stop talking about it on Decoder.\n\nSo, I also had Amy walk me through what a modern digital marketing company really does, how different kinds of ads operate in this ecosystem, and how she sees all this changing in the future. And we had to hash out the difference between influencer and creator, because that debate isn’t dying anytime soon.\n\nOkay: Digitas CEO Amy Lanzi. Here we go.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmy Lanzi, you are the CEO of Digitas. Welcome back to Decoder.\n\nThank you for having me. I’m thrilled to be back.\n\nI’ve been on Decoder. It’s kind of scary. Is it scary sometimes?\n\nIt’s not kind of scary, but it’s good scary, because it makes you, I don’t know, really be with it on what you’re going to be talking about, because we know the audience is very with it, so I like that.\n\nThey’re very with it.\n\nYes.\n\nI was just talking to your colleague before you showed up, and we were saying, “Hey, if the questions aren’t hard, you don’t get a chance to look smart.”\n\nThat’s right.\n\nWe have faith that you’re going to look smart. I have a question, though, that may be a weird one. I did a deep dive on your whole career, and I want to ask you a question.\n\nFor most of my life, I had assumed that the number of seats on an airplane determined the number of tickets sold for that airplane, and now I have in front of me a person who can tell me why that is not the case. So, of course, we all have heard that our airplane is in an oversold situation, and they start giving away free things in order for people not to use their ticket, and you used to be part of that system.\n\nHow does it work? And back when you did this decades ago, what was the algorithm? How did you decide this?\n\nWell, it was at a time when it was really all human, which is interesting. We did have models. It was my first job after college. I went to SMU, and I was a yield management analyst at American Airlines, and basically, that job is how do you extract the most yield out of each flight? And the assumption is that all seats are sold at the same price, as well as you can only sell the number of seats that exist, but have you ever missed a flight?\n\nI have.\n\nYes. That’s why there’s this whole team called yield management, and so you essentially look at the patterns of the flight. So I was assigned to LaGuardia, New York. I’m sorry, from Dallas to LaGuardia.\n\nOh, you had one flight?\n\nYeah, we would get assigned different routes.\n\nOr not a flight, but a route.\n\nYeah, you’d get assigned different routes, so I’ll give you two points here. The first was LaGuardia to Dallas, and so you assume a lot of business travel. Someone may, like you or me now, think, “Okay, I’m on the 6AM, maybe on the 7AM, or my meeting’s running late, so I’ll get on a later flight.” So, therefore, you get to make some assumptions on how many x-\n\nThat’s really specific.\n\nHow much can you overbook this flight?\n\nThis makes sense. So, if it’s like a bunch of families going to Orlando, it’s much less likely that they’re going to miss their flight.\n\nYes. So as a kid, I really didn’t pick up some of those consumer triggers as we would today, and I was assigned Dallas to Albuquerque. I didn’t really think much about it, but that was also when the hot air balloon festival was taking place. I did not calibrate accordingly, and we had a gigantic oversold problem because everyone showed up, because this is a big sojourn for many. I totally missed it.\n\nYeah. There’s a takeoff time. You have to make it.\n\nI missed that people were traveling and planning to go from Dallas to Albuquerque to make the flight, and they weren’t going to risk it like you and I might risk it if we are going for a business meeting or whatever it is. And so then you get into that oversold situation, and then you’re the one who’s figuring out how you are basically burning the profitability of this flight because you’re prompting people to get off a plane for a planned trip, which is very different now if you’re getting off for a business trip, for example.\n\nSo yeah, that was it, and what was great about that job — and I was also right out of college — was that it was non-revenue travel, so you could fly for free in the places that were a low load factor. You could basically just pay for the taxes on it, so we would play gate roulette, and we would pick places that we could all go to. For the weekend, we went to Des Moines, to all kinds of weird places we wouldn’t plan.\n\nYou never know where you’re going to go. I love a weird accidental travel trip, like you get stuck in Denver for 48 hours and you’re like, “I guess Denver. Sure. It’s got stuff. We’re going to Meow Wolf, I guess.”\n\nBut it was great, and my thing too is just wow, I had a front row seat to customer service and what that means.\n\nI bet they don’t do that anymore. I bet they don’t, because I read this, that they also were like, “And now you have to go and actually do the job of telling people that their flight is oversold.”\n\nYes. American Airlines was great about this. They had us go work at an airport, so I worked in Miami, which then all of a sudden, you’re like, “Hi, Hank. I see you’re a Super Whiz Bang traveler and you’re oversold, and I’m not going to get you on this flight.” And then you’re calling the people, and you’re like, “Oh, do me a solid. I got to get them on the flight.”\n\nSo yeah, it was great. It was a reminder of customer service, everything matters. Decisions you make in one place have a real impact on other people, even if they’re invisible to you in the moment. It was a fantastic experience.\n\nWell, now you’re the CEO of Digitas, which is an advertising agency inside of an advertising agency inside of an advertising agency, as far as I can tell, something like that. Is that right?\n\nSomething like that, yes.\n\n[Laughs] And your parent company has been around for 100 years.\n\nNext year is 100 years, yes.\n\nWow. Oh wow. So that’s real. I was guessing.\n\nNo, it’s real. Next year is 100 years.\n\nMy god. So I have to say, I don’t understand advertising, and I know that you also don’t, all the way, because what a mystery it all is to try and change people’s behavior with messages that are paid for. But I want you to explain something else that I have never understood, and I really want to know.\n\nSo, you’ve told me about how overbooked flights work, so now help me with this. I’ve been part of the advertising industry for 20 years now because I make stuff and then I sell ads on that stuff. It feels like magic, though, how any of this works. I guess, how does it work? What are you doing?\n\nThat’s a big, wide question.\n\nHow do you explain it? I don’t know. It feels like it’s all obvious and everybody’s seeing it all the time, but I’m in it and I still am very confused.\n\nYes. A couple of things. First, I would say there’s a bit of a reframe from advertising, like the Mad Men days, where you were in a room and you made a thing, and then you watched ABC, NBC, or CBS, and you saw this, or you saw a bus. Like in New York, it’s great to go see the Out-of-Home ad that was inside a bus, and those were the only things. We lived in a very static world.\n\nThere’s so much now, it’s so fractured now, which I feel like maybe is good for you?\n\nWell, so for me, Digitas is really a modern marketing agency versus an advertising agency, so that’s a shift — because the job is really building out a capability versus just the wallpaper you see. It’s so that I can figure out how much more I know about you through data, and I can magically surprise and delight Hank by understanding, “I think I can get Hank to do the one more thing.” Whether it’s buying a confectionery brand or booking a trip to wherever, I know a little bit about you because I’m picking up on the signals that you’re putting out there. Then I’m able to, one, create a relationship with you, but two, get you to do the thing that I think will make you better, faster, stronger. That’s how it works.\n\nIn the past, like 100 years ago, it was much more static. You had a story, you saw a thing, and most people did that thing. Now, everyone is so distributed. You talk a lot about this in terms of distribution when you think about where you and Nilay speak. This is really about understanding how to make meaning around the machines. This is what has become very hard.\n\nSo, if you are constantly just trying to win that algorithm, that gets hard unless you really stand for something in the world of AI. You need to actually make the market for yourself before you’re just trying to bid through terms to be able to beat the algorithms. It’s very difficult to do that. You have to really break through with real stories, but then you also have to be very smart about being in tune and picking up those signals to then say, “Okay, I see you. I see that you’re interested in something, and now I’m going to stay with you along that path to purchase or path to loyalty,” or whatever the job to be done is from the client.\n\nThis sounds extremely personalized. You’re going for me specifically, you’re talking about my story and how you connect with Hank Green, which is wild. Of course, you’re not theoretically marketing to any individual, though with certain products, it feels like maybe you’re aiming for a total of 25 people who make decisions, but whatever.\n\nWell, there are cohorts that exist that then enable us to do this in a scaled manner. It’s a very good question. That’s where the magic of media and creative come together, so I can start to understand that there’s a sizable group. I’m not going to be weird, and also, no one can afford to go find 25 people to be able to say, “Okay, how do I do a better job with first-time expectant moms? How do I become the brand of choice for first-time expectant parents?”\n\nThat’s the way to think about it, and there are a lot of people — and we think about ages and stages — that are in similar spots to create these big frameworks. So then you can start using the power of all the data and technology that’s in the market to be able to fine-tune those messages to feel relevant to you.\n\nAnd follow me through that. Can I ask a YouTuber-specific question, and then I’m going to zoom back out?\n\nSure, please.\n\nSo imagine that there are two ways to advertise, to show a 15-second spot, and one of those ways lets you target people with a ton of specificity, there are relatively fewer ads per minute of content. It’s newer, it’s a hipper place, it has higher-value demographics, and it has really good analytics for you.\n\nAnd then another place, you have no idea whether the people are watching the ads, the targeting is really broad. You’re often only able to hit people over 65 years old. Your ad’s going to be sandwiched between five other ads. Which one of those would you think would have a higher [cost-per-mille]? Which one of those would you think I would be getting paid more for as a creator on that platform?\n\nI would think that the first one.\n\nYeah. And yet I feel as if, and correct me if I’m wrong, but I get paid less per advertisement (by a lot) than somebody who’s making content for cable TV.\n\nI think this is where you get into the definition of, first of all, the way in. Did I find you on a creator platform, or did I find you because I went through and did a deal with one of these previously known as broadcast networks, or whatever? So now the entry point is much more around a media approach, versus I really want to find people who are into Hank. Those are two different ways in.\n\nI’m confused by the difference between those two things.\n\nSo, let’s say I want to do something on one of those major cable networks. I might go in because I’m going through the media partner that represents those assets that are on that cable network, and I’m going to do a media deal that also enables me to have access to one of their stars.\n\nOh, really? It’s like part of a package deal, and one of those stars is like a Property Brother or something.\n\nYeah, potentially, and you’re leveraging your position to be able to then create a special integration for the brand they’re representing. That’s one way to do it. That’s a different value, that’s a different pricing mechanism than going into a creator platform, which is, for us, we have Influential, and I want to find someone who is very into someone like you.\n\nI’m talking about buying just on YouTube, like buying through YouTube.\n\nWell, but the logic is a little similar in terms of how it happens, where YouTube is a whole different process in terms of the engagement model, on how you’re able to think about buying within that world.\n\nI’m going to act like a little baby and ask you to tell me what an engagement model is. I feel confused.\n\nThat means in terms of how I go out to the market and buy certain things. So if you’re asking about why one is more valuable than the other, the market controls what is priced at what level. Also, YouTube is very dynamic.\n\nAren’t you the market? Aren’t you the buyer? So you determine what the prices are. You determine what you’re willing to pay, right?\n\nWell, it’s a big market first of all.\n\nBut you, the advertising industry. I would assume it’s worth more to you to advertise on TV than it is to advertise on YouTube per 15-second spot. I know that because you pay more for it. Why is it worth more to be on TV?\n\nDo you think that the people in television are just better at selling you stuff? They work with you more, or it’s not an auction?\n\nI think it’s just a different market. So that’s what I mean by engagement model. So the model is different in terms of how we are able to buy things from different partners, just like it’s different when you buy something at Walmart versus somewhere else.\n\nSo, that’s why I’m saying the engagement model is different, and so biddable spaces are different. There’s so much more dynamic activity that’s happening on digitally native platforms versus some of the other ones, although they are starting to converge with the rise of [connected TV]. So you are seeing these worlds more blurred, but that doesn’t mean the commercial models have converged.\n\nThe models and measurements for each of these are different, so there’s a little bit of making all of those things work together. Because they’re not exactly all the same, but some companies use certain analytic modeling that is also favorable for certain channels.\n\nSo it’s not as simple as it seems, in terms of putting money in like it’s a calculator, and voila, this is what happens. That’s not how it works because they’re not all the same. Some are brand new. TikTok is relatively new versus some of these other partners you’re talking about, and so they’re all not exactly the same. Every impression isn’t the same, I guess, is the way to think of it, and they’re not all measured the same.\n\nFor sure. Yeah. Well, that is a real mess, like how you measure an impression. Maybe we should get into this for a second: what do you think of a platform where everybody can skip the ad instantaneously and has been trained by the platform to skip the ad? So with all these swipeable platforms, there’s no ad that you hit that you can’t swipe away from. Does that pose even some kind of threat to you?\n\nIt’s wild. And then what you see on those platforms, what you get, is just a preponderance of ads for things that you can really tightly measure how much you spend versus how much you make. So it’s a very Home Shopping Network kind of experience.\n\nYes, it is a threat, or compare that to someone who is watching a more traditional experience, and they have their phone in front of them, so they’re passively paying attention. In one way, you’re actually legitimately measuring whether someone skips or not, if you think about it, versus if you’re like my mother’s phrase, “I leave my TV on for company.” That’s also a whole other thing that I don’t think we’ve talked about that exists.\n\nThat’s an amazing thing that makes me feel like YouTube is a really valuable place to advertise. Not to rep my home base here. For an unskippable ad on YouTube or… YouTube reports whether or not someone skipped a skippable ad; you know that that person is there. They could mute their phone or their monitor or TV or whatever, but they aren’t probably for the most part. And maybe for some of those mid-roll ads, people could be in the other room, and they’re leaving YouTube on for company, just like they did with TV.\n\nBut it just feels like, at this point, YouTube is TV, and it’s surprising. If I were an advertiser, I’d be like, “Why would I ever, ever — unless I was trying to reach a very specific demographic — go on TV, where it remains more expensive?”\n\nIt depends. If you’re in sports, that’s an interesting place. There are some moments that push you to not be on YouTube. I am a big fan of YouTube. Many of my clients love the YouTube experience. If you can search, shop, socialize, and have all of those things coexisting in one place, and it is the most watched thing that is horizontal in your living room.\n\nIf I look at my 11-year-old, where they spend time, it’s watching Minecraft creators on YouTube in our living room, when I would have watched whatever show was on. So, I agree with you, but sometimes you’re not going to get things like the Super Bowl.\n\nFor sure. Those things you can’t get, for sure. So help me understand what Digitas does, because I think that Digitas is a very interesting piece of the advertising industry. To really get down to the nuts and bolts, can you imagine for a moment that you are approached by a brand? They do about $10 million in business per year; they’re small. They donate all their profit to charity, and they sell a variety of products. The idea is they’re a store, maybe it’s Good.Store. This is a thing that I run.\n\nSo they have coffee and they have soap, and they’re to figure out how to do marketing. If they approached you and were like, “We’re going to go big. We’ve got some money. We’re going to try and get into this space,” what would Digitas do? What services would they provide? How would they start? How would we start working together? What does that look like?\n\nSure. So first, we would think about how we describe the value prop of this company. What is your right to win, and how do we start to tell our story?\n\nMy right to win?\n\nYes. Why are you better than somebody else?\n\nThat’s why you’re in this business. My right to win. I deserve your money. I deserve to destroy my competition.\n\n[Laughs] Yes. So what is the single thing that these consumers are going to rush to your connected ecosystem to purchase and tell everyone about? So what do we stand for? How are we going to tell our story to the world? That’s part one.\n\nSecond, how are we investing those dollars you might have to recruit and retain consumers? What makes sense? Are we spending all of our money on YouTube? It sounds like that’s what you would like to do.\n\n[Laughs] I’ve had success on a variety of platforms, but I don’t think that we’re going to hit HDTV anytime soon.\n\nSo then we think about how we are going to be able to both recruit and retain the consumers you want so that you can grow. Third, and I am guessing, but this feels like a very socially relevant type of organization, as well as the value prop you’re putting out there. We might want to have creators who are also loving this and want to make the market for you. That’s something we call “social as a system.”\n\nNow I’m going to go out and say, “We know that cat video makers and people that make cooking videos and travel videos, those that follow those types of creators are also going to want to come and buy something from our store, so we’re going to co-create with them so that they are then able to bring more understanding of our offering as well as eventually drive more sales,” as an example.\n\nIt’s interesting, and I like this, that you talk about the role of marketing in the acquisition of a customer, but also the retention of that customer, which I completely agree with. I often find that when I’m working with marketing agencies, it’s very acquisition cost-focused and not thought about later. Retention is on us. We think about retention, and that’s not really integrated into our marketing strategy.\n\nTo me, I grew up on the 80/20 rule.\n\nIn this context, what is the 80/20 rule?\n\nThat 80 percent of your sales come from 20% of your customer base. So, when you’re obsessed with acquisition, you might not be getting incremental value out of your core. You also might be losing them because you’re doing things to drive acquisition that may turn off your core audience. So you should be thinking about recruiting and retaining always as a way to think about creating your own brand flywheel.\n\nWell, thank you for my free consultation.\n\n[Laughs] No problem.\n\nSo tell me about Digitas. I guess we should Decoder it. You’ve been here before, but how is Digitas structured?\n\nDigitas is structured… We are a modern marketing agency. We have five different practices that work together to deliver what we call network experiences. That means, “How do I build experiences to be able to get Hank to move from like to love to loyalty with the brands that we represent?” The practices are creative experiences, integrated media, CRM, commerce, and social transformation. We are powered by data and analytics.\n\nOkay, I’ve got to make you define all those terms now.\n\nSo you asked me about creative experiences. You asked me about this mythical company. That means, what do I sound like? What do I look like? What are the types of creative that I need to be able to engage with the consumers? Integrated media: how am I able to take the money that you have to spend in media, and I’m going to tell you where to spend it.\n\nCRM, or customer relationship management — this is loyalty. How am I texting and sending you emails so that you do more things with me and like me even more? Commerce is about how I make sure that I’m showing up in easy and seamless ways for you to buy my things. And then the last one is social: how am I using creators? How am I showing up on social so I am making the market for myself?\n\nSo Digitas refers to itself, describes itself, as a networked experience agency.\n\nYes.\n\nAgain, I’ve got to ask you to define the terms. There are so many words in that order. I’m not quite sure. I think… actually, I’ve done a little research. So I think I know, but please tell me.\n\nSure. Networked experience is essentially how we’re delivering an experience around the consumer so that we earn our way into your networks. You can’t just put comms out there and put any communication out there and think that consumers are just going to take it. They’re very hard to find, and we are in an attention battle, so I have to earn my way in as a brand that you go to and you pay attention to.\n\nThat comes from a combination of the things I talked about, which is: what I stand for. How am I going to, as a brand, make you faster, smarter, stronger? How am I going to find you in the places you’re spending your attention, whether you’re watching sports or whatever that is? And then how do I bring in some of those other services I talked about so that I’m continuing to drive growth for the brands we work with?\n\nSo we have also noticed in our background research that things at Digitas are described as unicorns. Digitas AI is the unicorn of AI operating systems, and SWOT is run by our team of social unicorns. The headline on your careers page is “Unicorns welcome.” I was just talking to your colleague, and in the background, there was an inflatable unicorn.\n\n[Laughs] Yes. So our people are unicorns, and the people power the offerings from Digitas.\n\nPart of this… It’s a weird thing. So Publicis has a bunch of different agencies inside of it, so I assume to some extent, you’re competing with your colleagues for business.\n\nWe are not competing with each other. So that’s a very good question.\n\nDoes it ever feel like you are?\n\nNo, because the culture of Publicis Groupe is very much around, we have the promise of the power of one, which is what my boss’s boss’s boss says to our clients. What that means is we are committed to bringing the very best talent and solutions to clients, and those come from all different types of agencies, not just one agency. We’re not biased by the one agency perimeter. This is very true. This is not true for every holding company. This is very much the core of Publicis Groupe. Otherwise, it’s bad for clients. If I’m in a fight for revenue for me versus my sister agency, that’s just not good for clients. That’s a distraction.\n\nFor me, Digitas, when we think about ourselves as unicorns, the culture of Digitas is we’re fearless, inventive, and generous, and our role is really finding those new inventive things that clients that come to us want and expect. That’s a little different than some of the places my sister agencies sit and where they focus on.\n\nSo, I’ll give you an example. We worked with Reddit to build out their community insights AI product. This is something that we co-created with them, because we found so many of our strategic planners were coming in looking for unique insights around what’s going on on Reddit. How are people talking about these brands? What can we find that would help me understand my right to win? See, I used it again?\n\n[Laughs] Mm-hmm.\n\nSo then we said to Reddit, “Let’s make a product, because this is something that we can do more with.” That’s a little bit of the things that Digitas would do. Some of the other agencies may not focus on that, and then we build that into our value prop to clients. It also might be something that we give to other clients through the power of one model.\n\nSure. And can you explain that product to me? So, if I have a brand, if I sell candy, is Reddit providing you reports of the buzz of communication of what’s going on with M&Ms or whatever?\n\nThat’s exactly right, and it’s basically what I can learn from the chatter on Reddit that bubbles up into insights, so I can learn something that may not be expected but is showing up there. Reddit is the gossip channel of the internet.\n\nA lot of it, yeah.\n\nAnd so this is a place for you to be able to look for those insights that might be the edges that then help you break through for that confectionery brand, for example.\n\nAnd then you can do a Harry Styles-flavored Oreo, because that’s what everybody wants.\n\nExactly. I’ll give you a real example. When we were working on Rivian, we were pitching their business, and Rivian is one of the most talked-about auto brands on Reddit. You [wouldn’t] think that just because they’re an EV and they’re not as giant as some of the other brands you might think of, but because the core of Reddit is really quite tech-oriented, or the original power users of Reddit, it makes sense.\n\nA first adopter place.\n\nYeah. This is a place for Rivian. You may not spend more money on Reddit. You may spend more money on other places because they’re trying to get moms to buy their product, so don’t fish where you already have won the people. This is your recruit and retain story.\n\nInteresting.\n\nSo that was an example. And so we had a couple of those come our way, and then we said to Reddit, “Hey, we think this could be a really interesting product for us to build together so that we can get to these insights faster for our clients.”\n\nHave you thought about doing that with other platforms? Twitter, YouTube? It seems like there’s a lot of insight, a lot of what happens in comments and various places.\n\nWe have different engagement models and products with different partners. Four years ago, we built the TikTok community commerce effort. This was really before TikTok understood the power or potential of TikTok Shops.\n\nOh, I think they understood it.\n\nIn the US, this is a US story. So what does that mean if a brand wants to do something on TikTok Shops? What do they need? What does TikTok need to do? What do I, as a brand, need to do to be able to stand that up, etc.?\n\nSo we worked with them to build that out, and then part of it is being able to get the connection so that you’re able to understand what’s possible, and also, is it moving? What insights are driving that assortment I should be selling on TikTok shops, for example?\n\nAnd is that a revenue generator for Reddit? Are you paying for that insight?\n\nNo, it’s not something like that. It’s more like the more you use a product like that, the more partners want to do more things with Reddit. Whether it’s more media investment or more content, they’re creating content specific to Reddit. So think of it as more of a lead-gen opportunity for Reddit.\n\nRight. And that’s something that you helped Reddit build internally?\n\nYes, we helped them on the product roadmap.\n\nInteresting. Weird. We’re talking about AI. We’re talking about AI. Everybody’s talking about AI. We’ve brought up AI several times already.\n\nYes.\n\nI don’t know. First, is there a threat there? Is there a world where a lot of this work is just being done by machines?\n\nThis is the big hot topic in my industry, and of course, there is a threat that there is a CMO who decides they’re just going to pick an AI partner and dump everything into that, and let the robots take over. But I think we’ve also determined that humans matter. Humans matter to be able to come up with actual creative ideas, not just content. It also matters when you think about brand governance and brand safety.\n\nWhen you think about AI for creative, and if you’re familiar with programmatic and the amount of brand safety that’s required to make sure that you are putting content in the right areas, all of that is even more important. So there’s governance that’s required so that the brand is holding up to the integrity of what the brand should be and what it stands for, and that’s still humans that need to be able to do that.\n\nTo me, the future is around how these things work together. As you mentioned, Digitas AI, for me, we’ve been working on that for two years, and it really is about how we create agents to minimize low-value activity that our clients don’t care about, but we need to do. So then you’re freeing up your time to do things that are human-based and more strategic, and that’s more valuable to them.\n\nSo, like reporting, pulling a report. Sure, we did the report, great. The insights around the report come from your brain, so let’s make sure that, whether it’s through automation or it’s through AI agents, we are able to get to that level of output, but then be able to take the brand and our clients to the next place they should be based on what we’ve learned from this assessment because we’ve done that much faster.\n\nI don’t know, I’m of the opinion that this transition happens more slowly than we might expect it otherwise would, because people have relationships with people, and ultimately, Digitas, an advertising agency, might be able to introduce some efficiencies.\n\nBut ultimately, a lot of what I would be paying for if Good.Store was working with Digitas, would be someone whom I trust. [Someone] who can explain the choices that are being made with my money, and then start from a place of a little bit of trust and work toward a lot of trust.\n\nI guess I could probably develop that with an AI agent at some point, but I feel as if that is going to take a lot of time. And a lot of CMOs… I don’t know, you let me know, but maybe they’re not actually the most innovative thinkers? I’m sorry, I feel mean saying that.\n\nNo, no, I think it is a people business. Clients call me because they say, “I don’t know what to do. What should I do?” And that sometimes is a technical question, and to your point, CMOs need to now be full-stack operators, and that means you now need to be technically advanced to be able to choose between all these AI products that are coming at you, which is not really the core of most of them.\n\nIt’s not that they can’t get there. It’s just that they don’t have a new team as well as that. That’s a full other day job to be able to determine all of that and the modern tech stack. The promise of it is great, not to mention that brand managers aren’t trained in business school to figure out how to use the Adobe or Salesforce AI products.\n\nSo, let’s pretend everything turns over. Then all of a sudden, they graduate and they suddenly get out of business school or whatever, and they go to CPG XYZ. They don’t know how to use that. They don’t know how to use Adobe Journey Manager. It gets very technical very fast, and it’s important because we want to have — where we started the call — greater personalization.\n\nYou’re a busy person, so I would hope the communications I send you are more on par with what you need versus waste, but that doesn’t mean we don’t need to thoughtfully think about the brand, what it stands for, what you want to engage with through culture, or what you don’t. What kind of new products you want to make, that takes time. And so I agree with you. I think it’s an important thing to bring into the fold, but I don’t see it completely just collapsing in the next quarter.\n\nCan I hit you with an assumption, and you can tell me where my assumption lies in your view of the world? There’s this narrative that this has all gotten really hard for advertising agencies because it’s very fractured, and there’s so much more data. So instead of vibing and being like, “Well, this is the kind of advertisement that would resonate with me, so maybe it’s going to resonate with other people,” that has made it much more difficult for advertising agencies.\n\nBut I think that while that might be true, my assumption is that this is better for advertising agencies because when things are more complicated, people are more likely to need a partner who understands that world rather than trying to figure it all out themselves.\n\nSo, two things: it’s an exciting time to be in an agency because all of the complexity enables us to see what actually worked, because we have so much data. At the core of Digitas is data and analytics. It was born to compete with the more traditional creative agencies that were just making ads for TV, and it was born on the promise of direct marketing. If I know more about you, I can think about what I should be sending to your house.\n\nNow, when you think about what’s happening, it’s like I can tell you, no, no, no. Your question earlier was, “Did this perform? Is my investment in YouTube performing harder than my investment in other places?” When we think about closed-loop measurement, I can pretty much start to figure out what’s working and what isn’t. So that’s pretty exciting, and if you’re okay with following the data versus wanting to put out things you think are cool, you’re in the right business. And I think that’s a change in the market where you need big ideas, but the ability to be humble to say, “Well, that didn’t work,” and we need to do something else faster.\n\nI do not know you, but do you feel like on the scale of quant to creative, that you are more in the quant part?\n\nI’m a quant. My dad was a physicist.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah, I’m a quant. I don’t know. I grew up in finance as an analyst and in yield management.\n\nBut then you’re managing a lot of creative people.\n\nSure.\n\nHow does that go? Is that ever a source of friction and conflict?\n\nNo, because the business is really about balancing art and science. So the founder that I worked for at an agency that was eventually acquired by Omnicom, he would say, “There are people who are linear thinkers and gut thinkers. Know the difference, and you need to be able to walk right down the middle.”\n\nSo if you’re always leaning on the data, you may do nothing that’s very interesting perhaps, but if you’re always focused on that gut feeling of “I think this is cool,” that may not be the thing that breaks through. You have to be able to harness both to really do something that’s going to deliver breakthrough thinking and growth.\n\nThe nice thing about being a creator in this day and age is that you can make something and then get direct feedback from an audience very quickly, and I assume that that is also the case for the creators who work for Digitas, making things with brands.\n\nI wanted to ask also, so there’s Publicis and there’s Omnicom, which are two giants in this space, and there’s a ton of smaller agencies that they now have gobbled up, and they’re part of them. When you get down to it, it’s basically just two very large companies controlling a lot of this world. What else is the competition for y’all?\n\nThe competition is wider than what I’ll call the holding companies, or holdcos, you’ve identified. So there’s Publicis, there’s Omnicom, there’s WPP, there’s a handful of them. I think there are about six that you would look at in terms of holdcos, then there are many independents that come in with a point solution that are fantastic at creative product, or they’re fantastic at CRM, and there are many of those that may be part of a holding company or are more independent.\n\nWhat is the advantage of the holding company? Can you articulate?\n\nScale.\n\nSo what’s the scale advantage? Just having HR and finance?\n\nNo, it’s like that Reddit example because they’re a gigantic partner of ours, so I’m able to work with them because we are a scaled partner, and I’m able to make things because of that scale. That is really important.\n\nSo in my world, if I don’t have that and a client calls me and says, “I want sports consulting,” that is not what we do. I can say, “Great, I can call Agency X, and I’m going to bring my friends into this session. They’re trusted partners.” I brief them, it’s much faster for the client. They don’t have to worry about all the other things.\n\nThis is such a complicated and multifaceted world with so much expertise necessary. It sounds like it would be very difficult to compete as a smaller agency.\n\nYou need to be very good to compete as a small agency, and if you’re very good, you can do well because most scaled clients also have determined a partner that’s large that can do the big things like media, your media partner, so then that enables some of these smaller players to come in and out because someone else has solved the big infrastructure need in the marketing world.\n\nOkay, last question, maybe a bit of a biggie. So I was listening to the last time you were talking to Nilay, and you talked last year about advertising being a thing that usually runs with some other kind of media, so it runs against a YouTube video, against a TV show, against a print magazine.\n\nI think we’re in a transitional moment, a bit of a crisis moment for media. I think media is getting passed over by Google. Those page views aren’t coming in because there are a lot of different ways that Google is eating up that traffic. [Journalism] has had its revenue eaten by platforms like Facebook and Google; that’s been going on for decades now. So, where does advertising go when there isn’t any media left for it to be placed upon?\n\nEvery brand has a different version of this depending on how they-\n\nEvery brand, like a partner, like someone you’re partnering with?\n\nYeah, think of a retailer versus a packaged good brand versus a travel partner. Some of them are more dependent on paid than others. So if you’re a brand today, you have to really be thinking about how you get closer to my consumers so that I can act as a brand, as a publisher.\n\nSo think about certain brands that you might’ve downloaded their app, and they’re already in your phone. You already have a relationship with that brand, and therefore, I’m not as dependent on investing more dollars in Meta or Google or whoever, because I have you already. I’ve won the battle of the storefront on your phone.\n\nGotcha. That is a battle.\n\nEspecially in the world of search and AI, this is an interesting thing when you’re watching that shift. You, as a brand, really have to be the answer for something. So then I know, “Oh, this brand is the answer for this, and then how they’re going to help me be a better runner, how they’re helping me to be a better parent.” I’m not dependent on what is fed to me through search platforms, and I’m going to make that decision: “Oh, I know that this brand is going to be my brand.”\n\nYou’re probably thinking of certain brands you just automatically go to, and you need to be able to figure out how you’re balancing out your need for paid to basically engage with those that are your fans, and then you keep them to be your superfans.\n\nWhat you just described is making content, right?\n\nContent distribution. Brands need to be content distribution systems to be able to play within and outside.\n\nDo you think that the bigger part of that will be partnering with influencers and creators and stuff?\n\nI do.\n\nOr will it be themselves as the internal content creation?\n\nI think that creator collabs are a must for modern brands. Bringing creators in is like bringing in a series of best friends. We all follow creators who feel like they’re your friend, and then all of a sudden, you’re believing them.\n\nBut even that is very fractional. It’s not like there’s a Michael Jordan anymore. If you’re working with creators on Instagram… In a market that I’m super interested in, like science communicators, there might be somebody who has 100,000 or 500,000 followers that I have never heard of, and that’s my business. So it’s crazy how much work that can be, and I assume that you’ve acquired or built a big thing like that internally.\n\nYes. We first acquired Influential and then Captivate. This enables us to have access to 15 million creators globally. And so then that enables you to quickly find these micro-influencers or creators, whatever language you want to use. We had a lot of debate about this the last time I was on.\n\nYeah, actually, I wanted to ask you about that.\n\nYeah, my position is the same. Every time I hear it and I see a client brief, it’s wildly “is it a creator? Is it an influencer?” I would say creators don’t want to be treated as influencers, but they all really want to be Hollywood stars eventually, so it is still a very interesting, fluid space. It hasn’t changed incidentally.\n\n[Laughs] I’ll push back against that. So “influencer” is a big pet peeve of mine, and I have appreciated that you don’t default to that term. And I think that there are definitely people who are influencers. I think that we may use that [label] differently, though. What I hear you say, influencer tends to mean that it’s a person with a larger following.\n\nYes.\n\nIs that how you consider it?\n\nThat’s how I consider it, and to me, the future is collaborating with creators big and small. Your brand has to show up with a place and a point of view so that the creator feels connected to it authentically, and then you co-create what makes sense. And then the community can feed back on how I should make the next product extension. What is that thing that I should be doing? The community is fantastic at feeding your pipeline, and I think the more you have a fluid relationship with creators, the more you will be successful, because consumers see themselves in creators before they see themselves in a brand.\n\nAgreed, yes. This is why creators are creating brands, because it’s easier to draw the line for your audience from, “This is me to this is the thing I made,” than it is from, “This is me to this is the thing someone else made that I like.”\n\nYes. But then I think some creators, that’s their hope and dream is to create a brand, but also you get into supply chain dynamics and distribution.\n\nOh yeah, it’s hard.\n\nIt gets hard. It sounds great, but it’s hard.\n\nNo, it is. It’s not something I would have gotten into if I hadn’t had 15 years of messing around in this space before.\n\nOf course.\n\nI’ll hit you with my influencer definition, which is that the reason I don’t like it is because it defines my job as what I do for you rather than what I do for my audience. So my job isn’t to influence my audience. My job is to make things that they will like, and then I am paid to influence them by companies sometimes.\n\nSo my job isn’t influencer, my job is a creator, but absolutely, I see that the job that I do when someone buys a brand deal on Hank’s channel, the job that I do for that person is influencing. But the job that I do for my audience is delighting and educating and having a good time, and giving them something that they’re part of and having fun with.\n\nYeah, I love that distinction. I’m going to steal it.\n\nGreat. This is the whole reason I agreed to do this for Nilay, so that that would happen.\n\nI’m starting today. But I would say that one of the main reasons I stay away from using the word influencer is when I watch my daughter, who’s in college, react, she’s like, “Ugh.” She can tell.\n\nRight. Well, that’s the good thing, is that the people whose whole job is working for marketing companies, they’re not making very authentic content.\n\nRight. So I don’t love the influencer concept. I like the idea of creators informing, and again, being a brand’s best friend and saying, “Hey, maybe you should do this.” That’s how I think of creators and how I counsel our brands, and how creators are a meaningful part of almost their marketing organization, really.\n\nOkay, last last question. Is advertising getting easier or harder right now?\n\nI think it’s the same.\n\nOkay. That is the hottest take I could have imagined you having. Everything feels like it’s changing so much right now.\n\nRight, but it’s always been changing, and here’s why I think it’s the same. My orientation is around: did this drive my client’s business? So if that’s always been your orientation and you’re using the data to say: did this sell more things, did I recruit more consumers in? It’s the same. If you’re holding on to what you think it used to be, which is that we’re setting culture, everyone will do exactly what we want them to do, then it’s really hard.\n\nAgain, I’m a quant. The founder that I work for picked people who weren’t really marketing and advertising people, and he trained all of us to have a consulting point of view. The only thing that matters is if you’re surprising and delighting consumers and if they’re buying more things, so if that’s always been your North Star, it’s the same.\n\nWell, but is it not harder to get people to buy more things? I guess not. People are buying.\n\nSo what’s harder now is determining what the single source of truth is and how you measure that. That’s hard because there are a lot of new ways to get to that same North Star.\n\nDo you mean the truth in terms of the message you’re getting to consumers?\n\nNo. When you think about all the different data and tech partners, everyone comes in with, “It did this, it did that, it did this, it did that.” And to our previous commentary on different media partners and how they measure things, it’s not all the same, so getting to the single point of truth is hard.\n\nThat’s got to be so frustrating.\n\nThat part is hard.\n\nWho’s the worst at it? Who do you trust the least with their data that they show you in terms of how your answers might-\n\n[Laughs] I can’t. I’ll get in trouble if I answer that.\n\nOkay. But there’s somebody in there?\n\nOf course. And my thing is that you can’t trust any of them. You need a healthy, unbiased partner to look across to be able to really have the right point of view on what happened in the market. And again, sales matter. Sales are a pretty good outcome of “Did we sell more things?”\n\nThat’s the easy one.\n\nVersus brand favorability or some of these other loose things that do matter, but can be a little squishy.\n\nYep. Yeah, I wish there were more brand-favorable advertising in my world. I feel like I’m really sales-focused. The partners that I work with are very much like, “I don’t really care how you did. As long as we made more money than it cost us to advertise with you, that’s all we care about,” which is understandable, but sometimes I just wish I could have a big old Toyota sponsorship or something.\n\nWell, brands need both. You need to be thinking fast and slow, because if everything is focused on, “Buy now, do this,” then you don’t remember that brand. So you do need to create these emotional structures with consumers.\n\nWell, keep me in mind, that’s all I’ll say.\n\nI’ll keep you in mind.\n\nI’ve got a whole company of educational media. It’s very brand safe, good people doing interesting things. A big halo around it. You can help make the world better. Just advertise with Complexly.\n\nAll right. I’m into it. Send me your stuff, okay?\n\nOh, well, of course. All right, Amy, thank you so much. For coming on Decoder.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nI learned so much.\n\nIt was great.

      "description": "The Israeli government ordered the seizure of 187 wallets it said belong to the IRGC, which have over time received $1.5 billion in crypto, according to a blockchain analysis firm.",
      "content": "Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced on Monday that it was ordering the seizure of 187 crypto wallets that allegedly belong to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC.\n\nIn a document detailing the seizure order, the ministry’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) said it was “convinced that the cryptocurrency wallets” in the list are property of the IRGC and are “used for the perpetration of a severe terror crime.”\n\nThe IRGC is sanctioned as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and Israel, among other countries.\n\nAccording to blockchain monitoring firm Elliptic, the named wallets have received $1.5 billion over time in Tether’s stablecoin USDT. Elliptic’s co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson said that the company cannot confirm whether those wallets do indeed belong to the IRGC. Robinson also said that the wallets currently only hold $1.5 million, a fraction of the funds that moved through them until today.\n\nIsrael’s Ministry of Defence did not respond to TechCrunch request for comment, asking questions on how it was able to establish that those 187 wallets are linked to the IRGC.\n\nIn a blog post, Elliptic said that “some of the addresses may be controlled by cryptocurrency services and could be part of wallet infrastructure used to facilitate transactions for many customers.”\n\nAmir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Iran-focused nonprofit Miaan Group, said it’s possible Israel found information about these wallets by hacking into Iran’s infrastructure. Rashidi added that “there were always rumors that the IRGC was using cryptocurrency to circumvent sanctions.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The hackers stole around $90 worth of crypto and then “burned” by sending it to inaccessible wallets, effectively destroying the digital funds.\n\nCrypto intelligence firms like Elliptic and TRM Labs previously said that Nobitex was used by the IRGC.",

The edges of app icons look like they’re carved out of a chunk of glass. When you press and hold on text to get a closer look at it, a glass-like bulb will magnify what you’re looking at. As you’re scrolling websites in Safari, you’ll see content slide under the translucent search bar and back button. Clear notifications float in on your homescreen and while you’re browsing your phone. The edges of your app dock and the buttons in Control Center even catch light differently based on the way you hold your phone.\n\nCheck out this gallery to get an idea of some of the ways that Liquid Glass shows up in iOS 26.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11 The iOS 26 homescreen.\n\nIt all feels very Apple: a bold new design that looks splashy and fancy and is suddenly everywhere on your phone. But it might also be pretty jarring when you first start using it. Ever since iOS 7 — this new update would have been iOS 19 had Apple not jumped all the way to 26 — things on your iPhone have generally looked pretty flat. Liquid Glass adds a little bit of virtual texture, and while the translucency can be an impressive visual effect, it takes getting used to for your day-to-day activities.\n\nInitially, Liquid Glass had a few major legibility problems, and throughout many betas, Apple has tinkered with many elements of the OS. And once the software is officially rolled out to everyone, I imagine Apple will tweak things even further in response to broader opinions and critiques.\n\nI’ve been living with Liquid Glass on my primary iPhone since it was announced three months ago, and I’ve gotten used to it. It’s fine. Even though iOS 26 makes things look way different, your iPhone, for the most part, will still work the same as it did on iOS 18.\n\nI’m sure a lot of people are going to say the design is Liquid Ass, and I’m sure Apple will tweak elements of it in response to the criticisms, like it did over the course of the iOS 26 betas. But Apple seems committed to Liquid Glass — it’s showing up across Apple’s other products today, too — so like it or not, you might just have to find a way to get used to it.",

      "content": "When it comes to mainstream gaming appeal, it’s hard to beat Mario Kart. Break out some controllers at a party and you’ll likely get a grid full of eager racers. The game’s seamless way of balancing disparate levels of skill and aggression creates an addictive experience for just about everyone.\n\nReal-world karting, on the other hand, remains more of a niche affair. Sure, plenty of people race karts at theme parks and putt-putt parking lots, but this style of racing isn’t on the radar for your average group of friends looking for a Friday diversion.\n\nWhat if you could do Mario Kart IRL without risking life and limb at some questionably safe theme park in China? That’s basically the question that RPM Raceway is answering with the launch of Kart Klash. Debuting today at three of RPM Raceway’s tracks in the northeast (Stamford, CT, and Long Island, NY), RPM has developed a way to bring a taste of Nintendo into reality. It’s only a taste, and it has room for improvement, but after getting an early go behind the wheel, I’m itching for more.\n\nSoftware meets hardware meets racetrack\n\nKart Klash is a new experience at RPM’s existing indoor tracks running electric Sodikart RSX2 karts. These machines offer variable levels of performance but can hit a maximum speed of 45 mph, which I can assure you feels pretty quick when your posterior is two inches from the floor.\n\nThey’re light-years more advanced than the smoky, lawnmower-engined rigs that you’ve probably experienced at some roadside tourist trap.\n\nAs someone who’s raced two-stroke performance karts in the past, I’m always skeptical at venues like this, but RPM’s karts did not disappoint. While not as fast as my old racer, in full-power mode, the Sodikart is plenty quick enough to make the tight, twisting, two-level track at RPM a real challenge in a straight race.\n\nBut things got way more fun when adding in rockets, land mines, and EMP bursts. After two races to learn the track, it was time to enable Kart Klash. While the team at RPM loaded up the prerelease software and rebooted the course, I was given a run-through of how to play.\n\nWhile a typical race is based on lap time — which is to say that you can finish last on the track but still win with the quickest lap — in Kart Klash, whoever crosses the finish line first after eight laps wins.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 9 Image: Tim Stevens\n\nA plethora of power-ups\n\nRacers grid up for a standing start, but starting up front isn’t necessarily an advantage. As in Mario Kart, the farther from the lead you are, the better the power-ups you receive. What kinds of power-ups? Well, they might sound a little... familiar.\n\nBoost — a quick shot of extra speed (mushroom)\n\nMissile — tracks and hits the kart immediately ahead of you (red shell)\n\nTop shot — a more powerful missile that tracks and hits the leader of the race (spinyblue shell)\n\nEMP — slows down every kart on the track except yours (lightning)\n\nTNT — an explosive surprise dropped behind your kart (banana)\n\nShield — protects you from attacks\n\nHyper — gives you both a boost and a shield (star)\n\nIs the arsenal in Kart Klash fresh and original? Absolutely not. It’s basically a one-to-one copy of the weapons you can find in Mario Kart, suitably changed to (hopefully) avoid any copyright concerns. But, if it ain’t broke, why fix it?\n\nTo collect these power-ups, you drive over a spot beamed onto the race track by an overhead laser projector. The result is little more than a spinning icon on the track, far from the dramatic floating 3D object shown in RPM’s promo videos. Still, you do at least get a notice on the LCD display on your kart’s steering wheel telling you which power-up you received, and then you can mash the right button on the steering wheel to fire.\n\nWhen you’re hit with a weapon, your kart slows down dramatically for a few seconds, just long enough to be intensely frustrating. You also get a little notice on the LCD display, telling you not only what weapon hit you, but who shot it.\n\nThat makes your eventual revenge all the sweeter.\n\nImage: RPM Raceway\n\nThe on-track experience\n\nWhat’s missing is visual cues for the weapons. You won’t actually see rockets firing ahead of you or TNT dropping behind, but the track uses a system of positional speakers sprinkled around, so you will hear the rocket roaring its way to the next target. Meanwhile, those watching the action trackside have an animated view that overlays the weapons on the track.\n\nSo the mechanics are all very familiar, but what I quickly learned after getting behind the wheel is that the video game experience doesn’t really translate to the real world. That’s primarily because this track isn’t anything like those in Mario Kart. RPM’s circuit may be twisty and lit with technicolor LEDs, but it’s no Rainbow Road.\n\nFor one thing, a single lap takes around 30 seconds, which is far shorter than your average Mario Kart track. It’s also significantly narrower, which dramatically changes the equation of most of the power-ups.\n\nFor example, if you get hit with a shell in Mario Kart, it’s very difficult to maintain your position. In Kart Klash, blocking is all too easy. If you get hit, you can just move to the middle of the track. You really need to time your shots perfectly to make a clean pass.\n\nThe other big change from Mario Kart is just how manic Kart Klash is. You can collect three or four power-ups per lap, which means one every 10 seconds or so. And, since your next power-up overrides your last one, you’re heavily incentivized to just mash that fire button.\n\nThose who save the most desirable power-ups in Mario Kart for the perfect moment, then, will be a little disappointed with the spray-and-pray nature of Kart Klash.\n\nDifferent, but still damned fun\n\nDespite those significant changes, Kart Klash still captures the core fun of the Mario Kart experience. It’s nowhere near as finely honed or perfectly balanced as Nintendo’s iconic race, but Andrew Farage, CEO of RPM Raceway, told me that his team will be eagerly listening to player feedback and adjusting details like weapon spawn rates and power-up positioning.\n\nTo provide that feedback, though, you’ll need to go out and try it for yourself. I went in as a skeptic, thinking there was no way the joyous, accessible fun of Mario Kart could possibly be replicated in real life. And to some degree that’s true. At its best, Kart Klash doesn’t quite achieve the same humorous heights as the game, if only because you can’t look your opponent in the face when your perfectly timed shell strikes true, but the added thrill of driving for real makes this far more exciting.\n\nAnd it had better be, as it’s a lot more expensive. The game launches today at $30 per race for RPM members and $40 for nonmembers. That’s about $10 more than a regular kart race, a premium well worth spending with the right crowd.",

      "content": "Last September, Snap revealed its fifth-generation Spectacles, upgraded AR glasses with a twist: they were only ever released to developers. One year later, we still haven’t seen even a glimpse of the consumer-ready version of those glasses, which the company still says is coming in 2026, but Snap is ready to show off Snap OS 2.0, a software update to those developer Spectacles that signals its plans for mainstream AR.\n\nThe big changes are actually surprisingly boring. A better web browser, a gallery app, some translation tools. These aren’t the fun, whimsical AR experiences that Snap has pushed in the past — they’re the functional things, the ones that might make next year’s new version of Specs a practical product rather than a glorified tech demo. They help sell Specs as a product you’d actually wear, beyond your living room or office and out there in the rest of the world.\n\nTake the browser. Snap says it’s been optimized for faster page loading and less power usage, but it’s also added more of the conveniences you expect from a browser, like bookmarks and resizeable windows. Now you can either awkwardly type a URL into the address bar using the virtual keyboard, or simply speak it out loud. I made the obligatory visit to www.theverge.com, which loaded up only a little slowly, in a mobile view that makes sense for the glasses’ simplified pinch-and-drag gesture controls. But more demanding sites work too — I pulled up YouTube and streamed a couple videos, with access to full playback controls and comments too.\n\nYouTube videos stream pretty well through the new browser app. GIF: Snap\n\nThere’s no dedicated YouTube app, though Snap is pitching its own content instead. There’s now a gallery app which lets you play back any videos you’ve recorded from the Specs’ own cameras, which wasn’t possible on the glasses themselves until now. A new Spotlight app lets you watch trending videos from Snapchat’s take on TikTok, which it’s keen to put front and center. Unlike on mobile, this app lets you pull comments up in a separate window to the side, making the most of the extra space that AR offers, furthering the feeling that this is partly a final feature, and partly proof-of-concept for future apps from other social platforms.\n\nThe Gallery app finally lets you watch Spectacles recordings from the glasses themselves. GIF: Snap\n\nAI-enabled live translation is closer to the sort of attention-grabbing announcement you might expect, even if it feels like we’ve seen a version of it at every single tech launch of the past few years. Snap shows me two different apps for the purpose. Translation provides voice-to-text translations from over 40 languages, albeit a little slowly. You can’t select the source language — it only offers automatic detection — which I suspect is part of the reason its translation took 10 seconds or so every time, which doesn’t exactly lend itself to free-flowing conversation. I was actually more impressed by the fact that it overlays text in speech bubbles below the speaker, whether it’s translating or not, giving it a neat secondary function as closed captions for the hard-of-hearing.\n\nSuper Travel is closer to Google Translate’s camera mode, letting you select text in your field of view to get a translation. Right now that pops up in its own window, though a future version should overlay that translation directly on the source text, which will prove much more useful for its primary purpose: pointing at something on a menu abroad and hoping you’re right about which dish is going to turn.\n\nThese apps are a mix of in-house development and those produced by the third-party developer community that’s likely to be integral to Specs’ eventual success. Snap needs to prove it can handle the boring infrastructural work of building an AR OS, but these glasses won’t get far with only Spotlight and a web browser, and it will need more devs to jump on board to build out the platform further. That’s part of the point of today’s announcement, I suspect: to convince more developers that Snap’s vision has legs.\n\nSnap isn’t ready to show off its next hardware just yet, so I tried last year’s model. A camera next to each lens helps the glasses “see” the world. There’s a button on each side too, with one used for power and the other to start screen recording. There’s a screen for each eye, though the field-of-view is fairly narrow.\n\nOf course, all of this is moot without the hardware. Snap’s current developer-only Spectacles are bulky, ugly, and get uncomfortable after more than a few minutes of use — not that you can use them for much longer than that, with a battery life of 45 minutes or so (Qi Pan, Snap’s director of computer vision engineering, tells me that battery is a “very tricky problem” for glasses like this that don’t use an external battery pack). The company is all too aware that this is not hardware ready to compete with the likes of Meta’s smart glasses, which do a lot less but blend in better thanks to partnerships with Ray-Ban and Oakley. Snap still isn’t ready to talk about what its next pair of consumer Specs will offer — all we know for sure is that they’re coming next year, and will cost less than Apple’s Vision Pro — but Pan clearly knows what they need to be: smaller, more stylish, and longer-lasting too.\n\nThe hardware is a work-in-progress then, and it’s clear that the software is too. The gesture controls are finicky, causing me to click when I don’t mean to or scroll haphazardly up and down, and the less said about the experience of trying to type in thin air, the better. But that’s fine — Snap has months to carry on refining its OS and enhancing its apps. What matters right now is the big picture stuff, its vision of what AR glasses are and why the makers of Snapchat, of all people, should be the ones to put them on your face.\n\nSnap’s going to have to shrink the Specs down considerably before they’re ready for the mass market.\n\nAccording to CEO Evan Spiegel, that vision is “a new kind of computer,” one that’s AI-first, that knows you, knows what you’re doing, and knows who you’re doing it with: “personalized, contextual, and shared.”\n\nIt’s that last word, more than any other, that seems to lie at the heart of Snap’s plan for Specs. Pan says Snap is keen to avoid the “social isolation” of full VR, maintaining the sense that “you can see the outside world, and everyone can see your eyes.” It speaks to the company’s history, first and foremost as a social app, something that seems to run through it in a way I’m not sure is any longer true of Meta. Snap OS 2.0’s updates may not include snazzy social features beyond its Spotlight support, but that’s partly because that social side has been baked in from the beginning, with multiplayer tech demos and silly AR lenses. Tellingly, there’s also no sign of any equivalent to Apple’s pitch that you should move your work life into AR.\n\n“Taking you out of the real world is not what we imagine the future spatial computing device to do,” as Pan puts it. “We want to just make your existing world slightly better, and not take you away from it.”\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge",

      "content": "PayPal is introducing a new way for people to send money to one another through peer-to-peer (p2p) payments made via personalized, one-time links. The system, called PayPal Links, complements the company’s existing feature called PayPal Me, which will continue to exist as a way to share your profile information and make it easier to get found and paid.\n\nThe company explains that PayPal Me links are not payment requests tied to a specific amount — at least until the receiver inputs how much they plan to pay.\n\nPayPal Me links were only used to get paid. The new PayPal Links, however, allow customers to either request or make a payment to another person by selecting the link option, inputting the amount, and then copying the link into a conversation. This makes the feature more useful for one-time payments or requests directly with another person without needing to identify and verify their profile or account information. As a result, there are fewer steps involved, making the payments faster.\n\nIn addition, PayPal links will soon be able to support crypto in the U.S., allowing users to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, PYUSD, and more to PayPal, Venmo, and other digital wallets that support crypto and stablecoins.\n\nThe feature will first be available to users in the U.S., but will expand later this month to other markets, including the U.K., Italy, and elsewhere.\n\nTo create a PayPal Link, users open the PayPal app and enter the details of the payment or request to generate a unique, one-time link. This link is private and is associated with just that transaction.\n\nThese PayPal Links can then be used in online conversations, texts, and DMs where money, costs, and purchases are being discussed. Any unclaimed links expire after 10 days, though users can send out a reminder or cancel the payment link at any time, if needed.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "description": "This LA-based startup raised $48M to tackle brand abuse",
      "content": "When Mark Lee was a law student at Harvard, a trademark class exposed him to the staggering scale of counterfeiting, an illicit industry worth more than $3 trillion annually, and set him on an unexpected path to entrepreneurship.\n\n“I was always broadly interested in technology and startups, but I never really thought I’d be an entrepreneur. I assumed I was set to become a lawyer; most of my family members are lawyers, and practicing law felt like a natural path,” Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. But when he got to Harvard Law, the education wasn’t quite what he expected, Lee said, adding that he began to question whether a career as a corporate lawyer was the right fit.\n\n“So I started exploring different ideas. One day, I took a trademark class and learned that counterfeiting is the world’s largest criminal enterprise, $3 trillion in counterfeit products traded every year, about 8% of global commerce. What struck me was that during COVID, as everything was moving online, this already massive market was growing 20% a year, fueled by marketplaces and social media,” Lee continued. “I saw it as a universal problem—and one that could be solved with the technology I was passionate about at the time: computer vision.”\n\nThat insight became the seed for MarqVision, the company he later co-founded in 2021. The name itself reflects its origins: “Marq” from trademark, and “Vision” from computer vision. The mission was straightforward but ambitious: harness AI-powered computer vision to fight counterfeiting and trademark infringement on a global scale.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and the LA-headquartered AI startup has closed a $48 million Series B round, bringing its total capital raised to about $90 million.\n\nRoughly half of the fresh capital will go toward expanding its AI and engineering teams to accelerate automation and integrate generative AI across its product suite. Another $10 million is earmarked for making the platform enterprise-ready as the company moves upmarket to target larger brands, while an additional $10 million will fund regional expansion. Already active in the U.S., Korea, China, and Europe, MarqVision is now entering Japan, highlighting the borderless nature of IP law and the company’s push to scale globally.\n\nThe financing was led by Peak XV Partners — formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA — with participation from Salesforce Ventures, HSG (formerly Sequoia China), Coral Capital, and Michael Seibel, partner emeritus at Y Combinator. Returning backers, including YC, Altos Ventures, and Atinum Investment, also joined the round.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

While many early-stage companies are experimenting with AI to disrupt labor-intensive service industries, very few have reached the early growth stage with the scale and traction.”\n\nMarqVision serves more than 350 customers worldwide across industries ranging from fashion and luxury to gaming, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, automotive, and consumer electronics. The startup reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue within eight months, $10 million in three years, and recently crossed $20 million after four years, doubling annually along the way.\n\n“Our goal is $100M ARR by mid-2027,” Lee said. “Growth could have been faster, but we prioritized two things: delivering the best customer experience and building a scalable AI-driven foundation. As a managed service, we can monetize many offerings, but everything ties back to one core promise—helping global brands control their digital presence and grow revenue.”\n\nOnce considered an unappealing category in technology, “services” is being redefined by AI, which brings software-like scalability and efficiency. This shift has fueled investor interest, with Peak XV, HSG, and Salesforce Ventures backing the company’s vision. The rise of large language models has reframed its positioning from a “software company with humans in the loop” to a leader in the emerging AI-led services space, drawing strong competition in its latest funding round.\n\nMarqVision started out fighting counterfeits, using AI to spot and remove fake products online. As the technology advanced, the startup shifted its focus toward helping brands directly recover lost revenue. Today, many clients report a roughly 5% boost in sales, making the platform valuable not just to legal teams but also to go-to-market organizations tracking revenue impact, according to Lee.\n\nWhen Lee first pitched MarqVision, he envisioned a $5 billion software company, selling $50,000 tools to 10,000 IP teams worldwide. But YC partner Michael Seibel urged him to think bigger — beyond software — by reimagining how IP and brand professionals work. MarqVision has since expanded into end-to-end managed services, an opportunity Lee now believes is 100 times larger than his original plan.\n\nBrand protection typically involves detecting and removing infringements like counterfeits and impersonations, while brand control goes further, giving companies the ability to manage their presence across e-commerce, social media, websites, and chat platforms, Lee noted. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes brand intelligence, offering insights into supply chains, pricing strategies, and reseller networks.\n\n“Our vision is to be the backbone of every global brand that owns IP — becoming the AI-led services platform for IP, content, and brand professionals worldwide,” Lee said.",

      "content": "Following its long-awaited launch of lossless streaming for paid subscribers, Spotify is upgrading its service for free users, too. On Monday, the company announced that free users globally will now be able to search and play any song they want or play a song shared by a friend or an artist they follow on social media.\n\nThe company calls the new features “Pick & Play,” “Search & Play,” and “Share & Play,” respectively. With the former, free users can hit play in the Spotify app to pick and play any song they want, or can even search for a particular song and play it.\n\nThe latter, “Share & Play,” could encourage free users to open Spotify when they come across music on social media. For instance, Instagram lets users share a Spotify track to Stories with sound and allows users to share music on Instagram Notes.\n\nPreviously, free users could shuffle songs with limited skips on mobile devices.\n\nSpotify says the new features will roll out globally to free users, but there will still be some restrictions that Premium users won’t face.\n\nIn recent months, Spotify’s ad business has been struggling, with CEO Daniel Ek telling investors the company has been “moving too slowly” on this front. The streamer wants ad revenue to make up 20% of its overall revenue, but has grown it only to 11% as of June. By adding new free features, Spotify could boost engagement among its free user base, who would then be exposed to more ads.\n\nSpotify says that other features, like its support for lossless, AI Playlists, and Mix, will remain Premium-only offerings, while others like the newly launched Messages and personalized playlist daylist, available to global users, will span both the free and paid experiences, as they had before.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "content": "Carla Rover once spent 30 minutes sobbing after having to restart a project she vibe coded.\n\nRover has been in the industry for 15 years, mainly working as a web developer. She’s now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces.\n\nShe called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be “worse than babysitting,” she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.\n\nShe had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools.\n\n“Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review,” she said. “When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more. And I learned my lesson.”\n\nShe and her son wound up restarting their whole project — hence the tears. “I handed it off like the copilot was an employee,” she said. “It isn’t.”\n\nRover is like many experienced programmers turning to AI for coding help. But such programmers are also finding themselves acting like AI babysitters — rewriting and fact-checking the code the AI spits out.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nA recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly found that at least 95% of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers.\n\nThese experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.\n\nWorking with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it’s given rise to a new corporate coding job known as “vibe code cleanup specialist.”\n\nTechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go.\n\n“Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, ‘Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,’” Rover said.\n\nCan they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren’t going to tell you. “It doesn’t make the kid less clever,” she continued. “It just means you can’t delegate [a task] like that completely.”\n\n“You’re absolutely right!”\n\nFeridoon Malekzadeh also compared vibe coding to a child.\n\nHe’s worked in the industry for more than 20 years, holding various roles in product development, software, and design. He’s building his own startup and heavily using vibe-coding platform Lovable, he said. For fun, he also vibe codes apps like one that generates Gen Alpha slang for Boomers.\n\nHe likes that he’s able to work alone on projects, saving time and money, but agrees that vibe coding is not like hiring an intern or a junior coder. Instead, vibe coding is akin to “hiring your stubborn, insolent teenager to help you do something,” he told TechCrunch.\n\n“You have to ask them 15 times to do something,” he said. “In the end, they do some of what you asked, some stuff you didn’t ask for, and they break a bunch of things along the way.”\n\nMalekzadeh estimates he spends around 50% of his time writing requirements, 10% to 20% of his time on vibe coding, and 30% to 40% of his time on vibe fixing — remedying the bugs and “unnecessary script” created by AI-written code.\n\nHe also doesn’t think vibe coding is the best at systems thinking — the process of seeing how a complex problem could impact an overall result. AI-generated code, he said, tries to solve more surface-level problems.\n\n“If you’re creating a feature that should be broadly available in your product, a good engineer would create that once and make it available everywhere that it’s needed,” Malekzadeh said. “Vibe coding will create something five different times, five different ways, if it’s needed in five different places. It leads to a lot of confusion, not only for the user, but for the model.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rover finds that AI “runs into a wall” when data conflicts with what it was hard-coded to do. “It can offer misleading advice, leave out key elements that are vital, or insert itself into a thought pathway you’re developing,” she said.\n\nShe also found that rather than admit to making errors, it will manufacture results.\n\nShe shared another example with TechCrunch, where she questioned the results an AI model initially gave her. The model started to give a detailed explanation pretending it used the data she uploaded. Only when she called it out did the AI model confess.\n\n“It freaked me out because it sounded like a toxic co-worker,” she said.\n\nOn top of this, there are the security concerns.\n\nAustin Spires is the senior director of developer enablement at Fastly and has been coding since the early 2000s.\n\nHe’s found through his own experience — along with chatting with customers — that vibe code likes to build what is quick rather than what is “right.” This may introduce vulnerabilities to the code of the kind that very new programmers tend to make, he said.\n\n“What often happens is the engineer needs to review the code, correct the agent, and tell the agent that they made a mistake,” Spires told TechCrunch. “This pattern is why we’ve seen the trope of ‘you’re absolutely right’ appear over social media.”\n\nHe’s referring to how AI models, like Anthropic Claude, tend to respond “you’re absolutely right” when called out on their mistakes.\n\nMike Arrowsmith, the chief trust officer at the IT management software company NinjaOne, has been in software engineering and security for around 20 years. He said that vibe coding is creating a new generation of IT and security blind spots to which young startups in particular are susceptible.\n\n“Vibe coding often bypasses the rigorous review processes that are foundational to traditional coding and crucial to catching vulnerabilities,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nNinjaOne, he said, counters this by encouraging “safe vibe coding,” where approved AI tools have access controls, along with mandatory peer review and, of course, security scanning.\n\nThe new normal\n\nWhile nearly everyone we spoke to agrees that AI-generated code and vibe-coding platforms are useful in many situations — like mocking up ideas — they all agree that human review is essential before building a business on it.\n\n“That cocktail napkin is not a business model,” Rover said. “You have to balance the ease with insight.”\n\nBut for all the lamenting on its errors, vibe coding has changed the present and the future of the job.\n\nRover said vibe coding helped her tremendously in crafting a better user interface. Malekzadeh simply said that, despite the time he spends fixing code, he still gets more done with AI coders than without them.\n\n“‘Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress,” Malekzadeh said, quoting the French theorist Paul Virilio, who spoke about inventing the shipwreck along with the ship.\n\nThe pros far outweigh the cons.\n\nThe Fastly survey found that senior developers were twice as likely to put AI-generated code into production compared to junior developers, saying that the technology helped them work faster.\n\nVibe coding is also part of Spires’ coding routine. He uses AI coding agents on several platforms for both front-end and back-end personal projects. He called the technology a mixed experience but said it’s good in helping with prototyping, building out boilerplate, or scaffolding out a test; it removes menial tasks so that engineers can focus on building, shipping, and scaling products.\n\nIt seems the extra hours spent combing through the vibe weeds will simply become a tolerated tax on using the innovation.\n\nElvis Kimara, a young engineer, is learning that now. He just graduated with a master’s in AI and is building an AI-powered marketplace.\n\nLike many coders, he said vibe coding has made his job harder and has often found vibe coding a joyless experience.\n\n“There’s no more dopamine from solving a problem by myself. The AI just figures it out,” he said. At one of his last jobs, he said senior developers didn’t look to help young coders as much — some not understanding new vibe-coding models, while others delegated mentorship tasks to said AI models.\n\nBut, he said, “the pros far outweigh the cons,” and he’s prepared to pay the innovation tax.\n\n“We won’t just be writing code; we’ll be guiding AI systems, taking accountability when things break, and acting more like consultants to machines,” Kimara said of the new normal for which he’s preparing.\n\n“Even as I grow into a senior role, I’ll keep using it,” he continued. “It’s been a real accelerator for me. I make sure I review every line of AI-generated code so I learn even faster from it.”\n\nThis post was updated to reflect the proper title of Mike Arrowsmith.",

      "content": "In Brief\n\nAI-powered chatbots play a growing role in spiritual life, according to a New York Times story that examines the popularity of religious chatbots and apps.\n\nThe Times notes that an app called Bible Chat has been downloaded more than 30 million times, while another app, Hallow, reached the number one spot in Apple’s App Store last year.\n\nFor the most part, these apps are supposed to point people to religious doctrine and scripture to answer their questions, although at least one website purports to allow users to chat with God. Rabbi Jonathan Roman suggested chatbots could be a “way into faith” for “a whole generation of people who have never been to a church or synagogue.”\n\nHowever, these chatbots are built on top of AI models that are designed to validate users’ opinions, to the point that they can reinforce delusional or conspiratorial thinking. Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M professor who studies the intersection of digital culture and religion, warned that chatbots “tell us what we want to hear.”\n\n“It’s not using spiritual discernment, it is using data and patterns,” Campbell said.",
