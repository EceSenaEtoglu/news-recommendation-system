Turning Point USA, the organisation Kirk co-founded, made the announcement on social media, inviting the public to celebrate his \"remarkable life and enduring legacy\". Kirk, 31, was shot dead on Wednesday during an open-air speaking event in Utah. His suspected killer, Tyler Robinson, was arrested on Thursday night after surrendering to police. President Donald Trump is expected to attend the memorial service, along with Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nBefore departing for Israel on Saturday, Rubio said he would be back in time for Kirk's memorial and remembered him as a \"great young man\". \"I admired all the stuff he said and did on campuses, and again, an enormous influence on young people, primarily,\" he said. Arizona marks an important place for Kirk - it's the location of Turning Point USA's headquarters and where he and his wife lived with their two children before his death. Shooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divide\n\nThe conservative influencer who rallied a youth movement\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson, the shooting suspect? Earlier on Saturday, Kirk's widow, Erika, made her first public remarks after her husband's death, pledging to keep his legacy alive. In a livestream broadcast from Turning Point USA's headquarters, Mrs Kirk, 36, addressed what she called the \"evil doers\" responsible for her husband's death. \"You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife, the cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry,\" she said. \"They should all know this: if you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before you have no idea, you have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country and this world.\" In a later Instagram post, Mrs Kirk reiterated those comments and posted videos and photos of her sitting over her husband's open casket and kissing his hand.\n\nWatch: Charlie Kirk's widow Erika makes first public statement since deadly shooting",

      "content": "Trump 'ready' to sanction Russia if Nato nations stop buying its oil\n\nHe described the purchases of Russian oil as \"shocking\" and also suggested that Nato place 50 to 100% tariffs on China, claiming it would weaken its \"strong control\" over Russia.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened tougher measures against Moscow, but has so far failed to take any action when the Kremlin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, he said he was \"ready to do major sanctions on Russia\" once Nato nations had \"agreed, and started, to do the same thing\".\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he is ready to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if Nato countries meet certain conditions which include stopping buying Russian oil.\n\nIn what he called a letter to Nato nations, Trump said: \"I am ready to 'go' when you are. Just say when?\"\n\nHe added \"the purchase of Russian oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia\".\n\nTrump also claimed the halt on Russian energy purchases, combined with heavy tariffs on China \"to be fully withdrawn\" after the war, would be of \"great help\" in ending the conflict.\n\nEurope's reliance on Russian energy has fallen dramatically since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2022, the EU got about 45% of its gas from Russia. That is expected to fall to about 13% this year, though Trump's words suggest he feels that figure is not enough.\n\nThe US president's message came during heightened tensions between Nato allies and Russia after more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace on Wednesday.\n\nWarsaw said the incursion was deliberate, but Moscow downplayed the incident and said it had \"no plans to target\" facilities in Poland.\n\nDenmark, France and Germany have joined a new Nato mission to bolster the alliance's eastern flank, and will move military assets eastwards.\n\nLast week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also made a demand to European nations over the purchase of Russian oil and gas.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, he said: \"We have to stop [buying] any kind of energy from Russia, and by the way, anything, any deals with Russia. We can't have any deals if we want to stop them.\"\n\nSince 2022, European nations have spent around €210bn (£182bn) on Russian oil and gas, according to the think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, much of which will have funded the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe EU has previously committed to phasing out the purchases by 2028. The US want that to happen faster - partly by buying supplies from them instead.\n\nTrump's message was to Nato, not the EU, therefore including nations such as Turkey, a major buyer of Russian oil and a country that has maintained closer relations with Moscow that any other member of the alliance.\n\nPersuading Ankara to cut off Russian supplies may be a far harder task.\n\nTrump's most recent threat of tougher sanctions on Russia came earlier in September after the Kremlin's heaviest bombardment on Ukraine since the war began.\n\nAsked by reporters if he was prepared to move to the \"second phase\" of punishing Moscow, Trump replied: \"Yeah, I am,\" though gave no details.\n\nThe US previously placed tariffs of 50% on goods from India - which included a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for the war in Ukraine.",

      "content": "Rubio in Israel as IDF destroys more Gaza City buildings\n\n25 minutes ago Share Save Thomas Spender Share Save\n\nWatch: Huge explosions as Israeli strikes hit residential buildings in Gaza City\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said US-Israeli relations have \"never been stronger\", as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio visits to discuss the war in Gaza following Israel's attack on Hamas members in Qatar. He told reporters the relationship was as strong and \"durable as the stones in the Western Wall\", while at the holy site in Jerusalem on Sunday. Earlier, Rubio said US President Donald Trump was unhappy with the Israeli strike on the key US ally, but stressed that the US-Israeli relationship was \"very strong\". His visit comes as Israeli forces continue to destroy residential buildings in Gaza City, forcing thousands to flee ahead of an expected ground offensive to seize the city.\n\n\"Obviously we're not happy about it, the president was not happy about it. Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next,\" Rubio said before he departed for Israel. In his remarks at Joint Base Andrews, Rubio added that Trump's priority remained the return of all hostages and an end to the war. Hamas members had been in Doha to discuss the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza when Israel launched its strikes. When asked whether the strike on Doha complicated Qatar's willingness to work with the US, Rubio said \"they've been good partners on a number of fronts\". Qatar - a key US ally in the region and the location of a major American air base - will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit on Monday to discuss next moves. Doha has condemned Israel's attack as \"cowardly\" and a \"flagrant violation of international law\". Netanyahu said the move was \"fully justified\" because it targeted senior Hamas leaders who organised the 7 October 2023 attacks. Some 48 Israeli hostages, of whom 20 are believed to remain alive, are being held by Hamas in Gaza. Their families have said Netanyahu is the \"one obstacle\" preventing their return and reaching a peace deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum wrote on social media that Israel's strike on Qatar last week shows \"every time a deal approaches, Netanyahu sabotages it\".\n\nReuters Rubio and Netanyahu visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem\n\nNetanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City has drawn international criticism, with the UN warning a military escalation in an area where famine has been declared will push civilians into an \"even deeper catastrophe\". Footage from Sunday verified by the BBC showed bombs hitting the al-Kawthar tower. Local officials told Reuters that at least 30 residential buildings had been destroyed. Israel said it had completed five waves of air strikes on the city over the past week, targeting more than 500 sites including what it said were Hamas reconnaissance and sniper sites, buildings containing tunnel openings and weapons depots. Israel has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave the city and head south and on Saturday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated about 250,000 Palestinians had fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area. Hamas has called on people not to leave. Some say they cannot afford to go while others say southern Gaza is not safe either as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. \"The bombardment intensified everywhere and we took down the tents, more than 20 families, we do not know where to go,\" Musbah al-Kafarna, displaced in Gaza City, told Reuters.\n\nReuters Palestinians continue to flee Israel's bombardment of Gaza City, heading south",

It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.",

Staff and some 75 cats and dogs were evacuated from the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter in Billings, Montana, when the building filled with smoke on Wednesday. The incinerator is usually used by animal control officers to dispose of euthanised animals, but local authorities said it can also be used by law enforcement to burn seized narcotics. The cats and dogs have been relocated, and the animals which experienced the most smoke exposure are now under supervision.\n\nThe incident was caused when smoke was pushed in the wrong direction because of negative pressure, according to Assistant City Administrator Kevin Iffland. Shelter executive director Triniti Halverson said she was unaware that a drug burn was happening. \"I can firmly and confidently say that, as the Executive Director, I did not know that they were disposing of extremely dangerous narcotics onsite,\" she wrote in a statement. \"My team and my animals had been confirmed to have been exposed to meth,\" she said. Before evacuating themselves, many employees put on masks and helped get the animals out. Some staff were exposed to the smoke for more than an hour, and several began to feel sick. All 14 went to the emergency room, where they spent about three hours in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to combat the effects of smoke inhalation. FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker told CBS News that the agency routinely uses outside facilities for controlled drug evidence burns.\n\nAP An employee walks a dog outside of the shelter on Friday",

The event saw drivers compete in a series of tram-based challenges, including quirky tasks of bowling and curling using the vehicle.

A total of 25 teams from across the globe battled out on a 250 metre long course. The world's tram-driving pros were tested on their ability to operate the vehicles in eight challenges, which included braking and accelerating smoothly. One test saw a bowl of water strapped to the front of the tram, with the driver tasked with braking smoothly in an effort to not spill any liquid. Another challenge - tram curling - saw the drivers push a bicycle trolley so it halted at a specific spot. Tram bowling, in which a giant ball is used to knock down inflatable pins, was another fan favourite.\n\nReuters Among the challenges was the unique idea of 'tram bowling'",

The Foreign Office (FCDO) said it was supporting the family of a couple being held in Afghanistan.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast in her first interview since being released, Ms Hall broke down in tears when asked what she would like to tell the couple. \"I love them, I know they will be out very soon, don't ever give up.\" Mr and Mrs Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years prior to their arrest - the reason for which has not been confirmed despite four court appearances. The pair had Afghan citizenship and ran a charity programme in the country, approved by the Taliban when they took power in 2021. Ms Hall said the group, which also included an interpreter, had flown from Kabul to Bamiyan Province in a privately chartered plane when they were stopped at a check point. They then spent days on the road being driven between police stations and prisons. She described the conditions in which they had been held, including cramped cells and a maximum security prison holding \"murderers\", fenced with barbed wire and where guards carried machine guns.\n\nPA Media Peter and Barbie Reynolds lived in Afghanistan for 18 years prior to their arrest in February\n\nShe warned that their health had rapidly deteriorated in prison, with Barbie losing significant weight and unable to stand or walk on one occasion. She also cautioned that Peter had been getting sicker despite receiving medication from the Qatari government, which he required daily after undergoing heart surgery and cancer treatment. \"We just have these elderly people, they're literally dying, and time is running out.\" She stressed that the conditions were taking a mental toll as well as physical, because \"every day you do not know where you'll be tomorrow\". \"It's not a healthy environment and we were the only foreigners there,\" she added. The pair's son previously told the BBC he feared they would die in prison, cautioning that Peter had suffered serious convulsions and Barbie was \"numb\" from anaemia and malnutrition. The UN warned in July that the couple could perish \"in such degrading conditions\" if they did not receive medical care at once, calling their detention \"inhumane\".\n\nReuters Faye Hall at the Qatari embassy in Kabul after being released in late March",

      "content": "Press freedom around the world has suffered its sharpest fall in 50 years as global democracy weakens dramatically, a landmark report has found.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), democracy has declined in 94 countries over the last five years and only a third have made progress.\n\n“Democracy faces a perfect storm of autocratic resurgence and acute uncertainty, due to massive social and economic changes,” Kevin Casas-Zamora, the secretary-general of the thinktank, said.\n\n“To fight back, democracies need to protect key elements of democracy, like elections and the rule of law, but also profoundly reform government so that it delivers fairness, inclusion and shared prosperity.”\n\nThe International IDEA’s survey – the Global State of Democracy Report 2025 – is published annually and considered the most comprehensive of its kind, covering 174 countries and measuring democratic performance from 1975.\n\nThe survey found that the freedom of the press had worsened in a quarter of the countries, marking the broadest deterioration since the beginning of the dataset.\n\nThe three largest declines were seen in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso and Myanmar, all suffering historically high levels of civil conflict, poverty and political instability. The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his government used defamation lawsuits to silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year.\n\nThe report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. In New Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently.\n\n“Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes.\n\nChile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families.\n\nThe thinktank highlighted some positive developments: Africa recorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too.\n\nBut the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote.\n\n“These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said.\n\nIn 2021, International IDEA added the US to its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019.\n\nOne measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues.\n\n“Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.",

      "title": "After a fatal crash, Sikh truck drivers in the US fear blowback",
      "description": "Sikh truck drivers say they've experienced an uptick in harassment after a fatal crash thrust them into the national spotlight.",
      "content": "After fatal crash, Sikh truck drivers in the US fear blowback\n\n16 hours ago Share Save Gagandeep Singh Reporting from Stockton, California Share Save\n\nGagandeep Singh\n\nThe trucks keep rolling on Highway 99 in California, the route bustling with freight traffic through the Central Valley. And behind the wheel is often a turbaned Sikh man, their cabs adorned with religious symbols, portraits of Sikh Gurus, or posters of Punjabi singers. Sikhs, a religious minority group from India, have become a large part of America's trucking industry, helping to deliver everything from California strawberries to lumber across the country. But a crash in Florida and its aftermath have sent shivers through the Sikh trucking community that could have economic consequences. There are approximately 750,000 Sikhs in America, and about 150,000 working in the trucking industry, mostly as drivers. The role they play in this essential industry is evident from the names on their trucks' doors - Singh Trucking, Punjab Trucking - to the curry served at rest stops along the west coast, where approximately 40% of all truck drivers are Sikh, according to the North American Punjabi Trucking Association. Many have limited English skills but years of driving experience. This has put some drivers in a precarious position, as the Trump administration has moved to tighten language requirements for commercial drivers. In response, many Sikh temples are offering language classes to help drivers pass their language tests. \"Many drivers stayed home out of fear of the new laws. We started the class in mid-July, to help them return to work,\" said Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal, who volunteers with a Sikh temple in Stockton, California. At an English class at the temple on Sunday, several drivers practised introductions and reviewed highway signs and regulatory signs. Many drivers felt shy about speaking but were motivated. Narinder Singh, a 51-year-old driver who has been working in America for eight years, says he's taking classes at the temple in Stockton because he thinks it's important to try to be a good citizen, and comply with the law. \"Sometimes an individual's actions may cost the entire community,\" he said, referencing a fatal crash on the other side of the country that has shone a harsh spotlight on Sikh drivers in California.\n\nA tragic crash shakes the industry\n\nOn 12 August, Harjinder Singh, an Indian-born truck driver, made a U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, crashing into a minivan and killing three people. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed that Harinder entered the US illegally from Mexico in 2018 and obtained a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) in California, despite having no legal right to be in the United States and failing an English proficiency exam. However, California officials say federal authorities told them he had a legal work permit when the state issued him a driver's licence. Harjinder now faces manslaughter and vehicular homicide charges in Florida and has been denied bail. His arraignment is slated for the end of September. The crash has had a ripple effect on Sikh truck drivers. Two weeks after the Florida crash, Secretary of State Marco Rubio paused the issuing of work visas for foreigners looking to become commercial truck drivers in the United States. There has also been an uptick in harassment against Sikh drivers, industry insiders tell the BBC. Raman Singh Dhillon, chief executive officer of North American Punjabi Trucking Association, said many drivers are now afraid of becoming targets. \"Sikh drivers are being harassed at truck stops. In some cases, even local law enforcement has been unresponsive,\" he says. While he supports Trump's calls for more regulation of commercial licenses, and English proficiency requirements, Raman is concerned that harassment and increasingly strict immigration laws will make it harder for Sikhs to work in the industry. \"The trucking industry will soon face a serious driver shortage,\" he said. It's a concern shared by many.\n\nGurpratap Singh Sandhu, who runs a Sacramento-based trucking company, reveals his cousin, a US citizen truck driver, was harassed last week in Florida just because of his ethnicity. \"People honk at Sikh truckers or throw water bottles at truck stops. They're being ridiculed and harassed. They're being called by racial slurs, like 'diaper-head' and 'towel-head', referring to their turbans,\" Gurpratap says. He worries about his drivers' security. The harassment impacts Gurpratap's business directly. \"Sikh drivers in my company are scared to go to Florida, Alabama, and Arkansas because of Immigration and Customs raids after the Florida crash,\" Gurpratap said, adding that immigrant drivers were once hailed as warriors during the pandemic, when supply backlogs made the value of the industry evident. Arjun Sethi, a law professor at George Washington University, said that the social media accounts in the United States and India, as well as some politicians, have used this tragedy to target the entire Sikh community. \"This episode should be treated as a singular, tragic event and not be weaponized to target the entire Sikh community,\" Arjun said. He also worries that rhetoric may lead to violence. \"We have seen for years how inflammatory rhetoric can lead to violence against those same communities. Sikhs have already faced this in the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh Temple mass shooting, in which six Sikhs were killed\", Arjun added. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2024 annual hate crime statistics show Sikhs remain the third most-targeted religious group behind the Jewish and Muslim communities. Following the crash, Special US Envoy Richard Grenell met with a group of Sikh representatives in Sacramento and took to social media to decry verbal attacks against Sikhs as \"un-American\" behavior.\n\nGagandeep Singh Raman Singh Dhillon, CEO of the North American Punjabi Trucker Association, and his wife Rupinder Kaur teach drivers in Stockton\n\nLearning in sacred spaces",

      "content": "Politicians in at least 51 countries used homophobic or transphobic rhetoric during elections last year, from depicting LGBTQ+ identity as a foreign threat to condemning “gender ideology”, according to a new study of 60 countries and the EU.\n\nHowever, there were also gains for LGBTQ+ representation in some countries. Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time in Botswana, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil.\n\nAs the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems.\n\nThere is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nHe said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … or Hungary or the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.”\n\nLGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as the first transgender member of the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according to data from advert tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nIn the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”.\n\nDuring election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+.\n\nBefore the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right parties made big gains, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally.\n\nIn Indonesia, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote.\n\nThe Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”",

      "content": "Six people have been shot dead in two days in a crime-plagued area of Cape Town, adding to the death toll in a city already reeling from the scourge of gang-related violence.\n\nAt 11.30pm on Monday, two women, aged 19 and 25, were killed and a 24-year-old woman injured in a shooting in Wallacedene, an informal settlement on Cape Town’s north-eastern edge, South African police said. About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked.\n\nThe suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal.\n\nOn 5 September, a man was shot dead at a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, the third killing in a Cape Town court since April.\n\nCape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according to data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz, a Mexican NGO.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according to city authorities, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950.\n\n“Our communities are fearful,” Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. “We don’t have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.”\n\nWestern Cape police said last week they were carrying out “targeted operations” in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: “The message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.”\n\nThe acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for “intelligence-driven operations” to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime, local media reported.\n\n“There is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,” said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance.\n\nMore than 26,000 people were murdered in South Africa last year, South African police data shows. Almost 3,500 of those were in Cape Town, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz.",

      "content": "'We knew the family': Utah town in disbelief after local resident accused of killing Charlie Kirk\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Kayla Epstein Washington, Utah Share Save\n\nGetty Images Forensic agents are seen at the house where Tyler Robinson is said to have been living\n\nWashington, Utah, located just south-west of Zion National Park, is surrounded by cinematic, flat-topped mountains and has long been a hub for exploring the natural wonders of the American west. Yet, the last 48 hours have left residents wondering how the portal to the most beautiful parts of the country may have produced one of its ugliest acts of political violence in years. Tyler Robinson, the man authorities accused of killing the conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University this week, resided in the area, according to police. He is now in custody after his father apparently persuaded him to surrender. Local and federal law enforcement officers descended on typically quiet blocks in Washington and nearby St George, banging on doors and closing off streets as they carried out a high-stakes investigation. Outside the Robinson family home in Washington, neighbours expressed shock that a fellow resident could have committed such an attack.\n\n\"It shakes up a community because you don't expect it,\" said Addi Jacobson, 20, who recently moved into her grandmother's house in the neighbourhood. Ms Jacobson said she did not personally know the Robinson family, but her grandmother did. \"She just was saying that she thinks that, from what she's seen and what she knows, they're a great family, just regular citizens,\" Ms Jacobson said. \"She used the words, 'very patriotic people'.\" \"We knew their family. Our whole neighbourhood is so close,\" said another neighbour who lives around the corner. She asked the BBC not use her name due to the heated political and online discussion Mr Kirk's murder. The woman recalled Tyler Robinson \"was a pretty quiet kid\", though his younger brothers were more involved in community activities and sports. She called his mother \"an amazing parent\" and his father \"a hard worker\". Both occasionally attended a nearby Mormon church, she said. \"That just even goes to show, you can be an amazing parent, and your kid still just chooses what they choose,\" said the neighbour. \"This is a good family,\" Utah Governor Spencer Cox told CNN on Saturday. \"A normal childhood. All of those things that, that you would hope would never lead to something like this. And sadly, it did.\" On 10 September, Charlie Kirk was shot in front of hundreds of students and observers, and later pronounced dead at the hospital. Videos of the carnage spread across social media, and President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, and leaders of both major US political parties condemned the assassination. \"If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea. You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country,\" the activist's wife, Erika Kirk, said in her first public statement on Friday evening.\n\nSearching for clues about Tyler Robinson in his home town",

      "content": "South African prosecutors will reopen an inquest into the death of the prominent anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, nearly 50 years after he died in police custody.\n\nBiko, the founder of South Africa’s Black Consciousness Movement, died in a prison cell in 1977 aged just 30, after being beaten into a coma by police who had arrested him nearly a month earlier.\n\nThe death sparked outrage across the world and he became an international symbol of the struggle against the race-based apartheid system that denied South Africa’s black majority political and economic rights.\n\n“The main goal of reopening the inquest is to lay before the court evidence that will enable the court to make a finding … as to whether the death was brought about by any act, or omission, which prima facie involves or amounts to an offence on the part of any person,” the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Wednesday.\n\nThe case will be reopened on the 48th anniversary of Biko’s death on 12 September.\n\nA 1977 inquest accepted the police account that Biko sustained injuries when he hit his head against the wall and no one was prosecuted for the death.\n\nBut in 1997, former police officers implicated in the case admitted assaulting the activist during hearings by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) into atrocities committed during the apartheid era.\n\nThe TRC refused to grant amnesty to the officers, ruling that they lied in their evidence and failed to prove a political motive for killing Biko.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Long Wave Free weekly newsletter Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In April the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, launched an inquiry into whether past ANC governments interfered with the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes, amid criticism from the families of victims.\n\nIn June an inquest was opened into one of the period’s most notorious crime: the deaths of four men known as the Cradock Four, who were stopped at a roadblock in 1985 by security officers and beaten, strangled with telephone wire, stabbed and shot to death.",

      "content": "More children around the world are obese than underweight for the first time, according to a UN report that warns ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets.\n\nThere are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10 – Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases.\n\nCatherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children.\n\n“Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health.”\n\nWhile 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sulakshyan, 10, and his brother Subharna, 7, watch videos at home in Kathmandu. Nepal’s urbanisation has made ultra-processed food more widespread. Photograph: Bishal Bisht/Unicef\n\nObesity has overtaken being underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is a problem even in countries with high numbers of children suffering from wasting or stunting due to a lack of food.\n\nThe report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children, used data from more than 190 countries and sources including Unicef, the World Health Organization and the World Bank.\n\nIt revealed that one in five of those aged between five and 19 are overweight, with a growing proportion of those 291 million individuals falling into the obese category: 42% in 2022, up from 30% in 2000.\n\nObesity was highest in Pacific Island countries, where there has been “a shift from traditional diets to cheap, energy-dense, imported food”, the report found. In Niue, 38% of five to 19-year-olds are obese, and the figure is 37% in the Cook Islands. Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%).\n\nIn the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%.\n\nThe steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”.\n\nChildhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life.\n\nThere is growing international concern about the damaging health impacts of UPFs, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt.\n\nUPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sweets on sale at a roadside stall in Nairobi. In the past 20 years, the percentage of obese adolescent girls in Kenya has more than doubled to 13%. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nNomathemba Chandiwana, chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Cape Town, South Africa, said: “We often only think of malnutrition here as underweight or stunting, but obesity has the same long-term consequences.\n\n“About one in eight children are overweight or have obesity, while one in four are stunted. That double burden is shaping a generation’s health,” she said, adding that children were targeted by “relentless” marketing of fast food, even in schools.\n\n“It’s really tough trying to tackle both undernutrition and obesity at the same time. South Africa is a middle-income country, but still deeply unequal. Many children grow up both hungry and surrounded by cheap, poor-quality food.\n\n“Most of the attention and resources go to undernutrition and stunting in the early years, which of course matters, but obesity isn’t always seen as malnutrition, so it slips under the radar,” she said.\n\nGrowing rates of childhood obesity will have a major impact economically. The World Obesity Federation has previously estimated that by 2035, the global cost of overweight and obesity will surpass $4tn (£2.9tn) annually.\n\nView image in fullscreen Children in Kampala, Uganda, consume snacks and sugary drinks during a school break. Obesity is not always seen as malnutrition. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nThe report highlighted the positive action of Mexico’s ban on the sale and distribution of UPFs in schools.\n\nBut it added that “the unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments”.\n\nUnicef called on governments to act on this by using labelling, marketing restrictions, taxes and subsidies. It suggested banning junk foods and their marketing in schools, and better programmes for vulnerable families to afford nutritious diets.\n\nThere should be “strong safeguards to protect public-policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry”, it said.",

      "content": "A congressional staffer from Mexico’s ruling party has resigned after being called out online for comments he made on a major Mexican television news program about Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk’s murder.\n\nThe news network, Milenio, also released a public apology after the United States’ deputy secretary of state – a former ambassador to Mexico – evidently threatened to have Donald Trump’s presidential administration revoke any US visas on which it may count.\n\nThe episode that unfolded at Milenio continued a trend of people losing their jobs over commentary about Kirk – a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate – deemed offensive by American conservatives, though in this instance it was outside the US.\n\nKirk, a close Trump ally, was shot dead Wednesday while speaking at a university in Utah. Following his death, conservative commentators, activists and public officials in the US have engaged in social media campaigns against people accused of disrespecting Kirk’s memory.\n\nA Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended.\n\nOn Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador, warned on X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”.\n\n“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the state department can protect the American people,” said Landau, who was appointed US ambassador to Mexico and served from 2019 to 2021 during Trump’s first presidency.\n\nPeople began responding to Landau’s post with examples of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk’s death. Among those was a clip of Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for the ruling Morena party, speaking on a television news program on Milenio.\n\nRamírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk’s killing.\n\n“I think if Charlie Kirk lived, he may like what I am about to say, because what I am about to say is very ‘anti-woke’,” Ramírez facetiously said. “He was given a spoonful of his own chocolate. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. They gave a spoonful to someone who was financed by the National Rifle Association – a political association that is of the extreme right, pro-Trump, of the most radical wing of the Republicans.”\n\nRamírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”.\n\nAfter a post tagging Milenio and the Morena party made Landau aware of Ramirez’s comments, he responded with an image reading “El Quitavisas”, roughly meaning “the visa remover”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico.\n\n“Really, Milenio? This is the level of ‘discourse’ that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,” Landau wrote.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later that evening, Ramirez officially announced his resignation from the parliamentary group for the Morena party within the Mexican house of representatives.\n\nOthers who had similarly lost their jobs or been disciplined at them over commentary about Kirk’s killing have included journalists, academic workers, teachers, nurses a Secret Service employee, a firefighter and a worker for an NFL team.\n\nPreviously, the Trump administration has targeted people, including students and academic workers, for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments on social media and for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nThe FBI announced on Friday that Kirk’s alleged killer had been arrested after a two-day manhunt.",

      "content": "What to expect from the Emmys and how to watch the ceremony\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Owen Cooper (left, with Stephen Graham), could become the youngest ever male winner of an acting Emmy\n\nAdolescence, The White Lotus, Severance and The Penguin are a few of the TV shows that will battle it out later at the Emmys, the television industry's most prestigious awards ceremony. Owen Cooper, the 15-year-old British star of Adolescence, Netflix's series about a teenager accused of murdering a classmate, could become the youngest male actor ever to win an Emmy. Elsewhere, a campaign led by US chat show hosts following the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert could see the programme win outstanding talk series for the first time. The ceremony will take place on Sunday evening at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Studio, Andor, Hacks, Slow Horses, The Bear, Nobody Wants This and The Last of Us are among the other shows competing for the top prizes. Here's everything you need to know ahead of TV's biggest night:\n\nWho is hosting the Emmys?\n\nGetty Images Nate Bargatze, pictured on stage at the Golden Globes in January, is known for his family-friendly comic style\n\nUS comedian Nate Bargatze is this year's Emmys host. He may not be a household name in the UK, but Bargatze is well known to American viewers and he sold more tickets to his shows than any other stand-up in the US last year. As well as his own TV stand-up specials, Bargatze has appeared on a string of late-night talk shows including Seth Meyers, Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon, as well as variety show Saturday Night Live. The 46-year-old is unlikely to go the Ricky Gervais route with a controversial opening monologue. He is known as a more family-friendly comedian who often uses observational humour. Bargatze has said it is a \"huge honour\" to be hosting the event, and he has some interesting rules too. He plans to tell nominees that he will donate $100,000 to charity on the night, but the donation will decrease for every acceptance speech that goes over the time limit. \"So is thanking your second manager worth taking food from a child?\" he asked. \"I don't think so, but we'll see what Hollywood thinks.\"\n\nWhich TV shows are nominated?\n\nGetty Images Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri are both nominated again for their performances in The Bear\n\nThe Emmys split their nominations into three categories: comedy, drama and limited series. Outstanding drama is traditionally seen as the most prestigious award of the night, and the field is wide open this year in the absence of last year's winner Shogun, which has not yet started production on its next season. Instead, this year's contenders include wealth satire The White Lotus, Star Wars spin-off Andor, dystopian drama Paradise and sci-fi thriller Severance. They are joined in the category by video game adaptation The Last of Us, medical series The Pitt, espionage drama Slow Horses and political thriller The Diplomat. The comedy categories see two former winners compete to take the title again - kitchen drama The Bear and entertainment satire Hacks.\n\nGetty Images British actress Aimee Lou Wood is nominated for The White Lotus, as is her co-star Walton Goggins\n\nThey face competition from the school-based Abbott Elementary, romantic comedy Nobody Wants This, and crime mystery Only Murders in the Building. The category is completed by vampire mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows, therapist comedy Shrinking and Hollywood satire The Studio. Emmys 2025: The key nominees Meanwhile, the limited and anthology series category is led by Adolescence, a show which enjoyed as many headlines for its one-take shooting style as it did for its exploration of the impact of smartphones' on teenagers. It faces competition from the dystopian Black Mirror, Batman spin-off The Penguin, erotic cancer comedy Dying for Sex, and true-crime adaptation Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.\n\nRecord breakers and controversies\n\nGetty Images Roxana Zal, pictured in 1984's Something About Amelia, is the youngest ever Emmy winner for acting\n\nAt 15, Cooper would not be the youngest winner for acting in Emmys history. That record is held by Roxana Zal who was 14 when she won in 1984 for her role in TV movie Something About Amelia. Other notable teenage winners over the years include Kristy McNichol and Scott Jacoby, while the list of youngest nominees includes Frankie Muniz, Claire Danes, Millie Bobby Brown and Keshia Knight Pulliam, who was just six when she was nominated for The Cosby Show. But Cooper would be the youngest ever winner in his category - best supporting actor in a limited series - as well as the youngest male winner overall in any acting category. Other supporting actors and actresses nominated at the Emmys this year include Aimee Lou Wood, Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs, Catherine O'Hara, Sam Rockwell, Colman Domingo, Harrison Ford, Javier Bardem and Erin Doherty. In the lead categories, nominees include Cate Blanchett, Jake Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell, Ayo Edebiri, Jean Smart, Kathy Bates, Jeremy Allen White, Bella Ramsey, Gary Oldman, Pedro Pascal, Michelle Williams and Stephen Graham.\n\nGetty Images Kimmel (right), pictured with Colbert at the 2019 Emmys, has said his fellow nominee should win best talk show\n\nThere is also a lot of interest in the variety talk series category this year, after a turbulent year for the late-night circuit. CBS announced in July that it would be cancelling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which he has hosted since 2015. The network said it was a financial decision, but there was surprise in the industry given its relative popularity, and some suggested political pressure might have played a role in its cancellation. Other talk show hosts, including some of Colbert's fellow nominees, have publicly supported him by saying they will be voting for him at the Emmys this year, and have encouraged others to do the same. A billboard ad in West Hollywood taken out last month by Jimmy Kimmel, one of Colbert's rivals in the category, saw the talk show host declare: \"I'm voting for Stephen.\" The Late Show already won its first Emmy last week, when it won a directing prize at the Creative Arts Emmys, a separate ceremony which precedes the main event.\n\nHow to watch the Emmy Awards\n\nGetty Images Abbott Elementary's Quinta Brunson (left) and Sheryl Lee Ralph are among the comedy series nominees",

      "content": "Early on 18 March 1976, Francisco Tenório Cerqueira Júnior, a Brazilian pianist who had played alongside some of Latin America’s greatest musicians, disappeared from the streets of Buenos Aires.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, his fate has remained a mystery, sparking desperate searches, raising suspicions of government complicity, and inspiring international documentaries. Now the mystery has been solved, with forensic scientists formally identifying Tenório Júnior’s body – and confirming he was a victim of Argentina’s bloody dictatorship.\n\n“He left his hotel in the centre of the city and the earth ate him,” said Carlos “Maco” Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF). “Nothing more was ever known – until now.”\n\nTenório Júnior, known to most as Tenorinho, was regarded as one of the leading figures of the bossa nova movement – Brazil’s celebrated fusion of samba and jazz. One critic praised him as a pianist with “hands of gold” and an “enormous future”.\n\nOn 17 March 1976, during a South American tour, he performed alongside the Brazilian legends Vinícius de Moraes and Toquinho at the Gran Rex in Buenos Aires. Around three o’clock the following morning, the 34-year-old left his downtown hotel in search of cigarettes and aspirin, and was never seen again.\n\nIn the days that followed, his fellow musicians searched frantically, combing through the hospitals and morgues. Moraes, the lyricist of The Girl from Ipanema, filed a habeas corpus writ and appealed directly to the Brazilian ambassador. By then, Tenorinho, a husband and father of four, was already dead: he had been seized by the Argentinian military and executed, his body dumped in wasteland 30km away.\n\nHis killing came less than a week before a military coup d’état, which plunged the country into a dark chapter of fear, torture and forced disappearances.\n\nOver seven years, tens of thousands of political opponents, student activists, journalists, intellectuals – and countless bystanders – would be abducted, held in clandestine detention centres, tortured and killed. Some were thrown alive from planes, others disposed of in mass graves. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were disappeared.\n\nDecades after Tenorinho’s disappearance, at the 2014 National Truth Commission, his widow Carmen Magalhães Tenório Cerqueira, demanded answers for what happened to her husband. “Where is Tenorinho?” she pressed. “Tenório was a person who never had any involvement with politics. He was a person who lived for music … And what happened to him is really something that … is absurd,” she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Carlos Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team. Photograph: Harriet Barber\n\nToquinho channeled his pain into a song called Lembranças, or Memories: “Tenório went out alone into the night / He disappeared / No one could explain.”\n\nOver the years, various witnesses came forward; a man working at a newsstand near the hotel said he saw Tenorinho taken away in a green Ford Falcon – the infamous car of choice used by Argentina’s death squads.\n\nOfficial confirmation of what happened would finally come thanks, primarily, to an Argentinian forensic team which to this day excavates and identifies those disappeared by the military regime.\n\nThe group was originally set up by the Texas forensic anthropologist Dr Clyde Snow – renowned for identifying the skeleton of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele – after Argentina’s return to democracy. They made an unusual team at first; unable to find willing colleagues, with many Argentinians still fearful of a return to the dictatorship, Snow had instead recruited a collection of anthropology students.\n\n“None of us were jumping with joy to do this, because if we started to work on this and a new military coup occurred, we would end up on the list of people who could disappear,” said Mercedes “Mimi” Doretti, one of the founders, last year. “But at the same time, we couldn’t say no.”\n\nDecades on, the group continues to search for the victims of the dictatorship, scouring archives, interviewing witnesses, corroborating timelines and conducting digs at suspected mass graves. Today, technological advances also have made it possible to conduct mass fingerprint comparisons – the technique that ultimately led to Tenorinho’s discovery. More than 1,500 bodies have been recovered, and more than 840 people identified.\n\n“At the same time that the state had been torturing, killing and throwing people from planes, they kept their bureaucratic ways of working, recording deaths, taking fingerprints of the corpses,” said Somigliana, who has worked with the EAAF since 1986. “In many cases, the state tried to avoid this, by burning the bodies, cutting hands off, but in others they left a chain of documents.”\n\nWhile the team had been seeking Tenorinho’s fingerprints for some years, his case gained momentum in 2024, when the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity found an old file containing the details of a murder victim who had “appeared in a small unoccupied piece of land” in the Tigre district on 20 March 1976.\n\n“The death certificate said ‘man with many gunshots, around 30 years old, with a beard’,” said Somigliana.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dr Clyde Snow and the EAAF. Photograph: No credit\n\n“We compared the fingerprints with all of those people kidnapped in Argentina, and there was no match. Why? Because he was not from Argentina. Then we asked for the fingerprints from Brazil, and when they came, we were able to confirm that this body was him.”\n\nTenorinho’s unnamed body was buried at the Benavídez Municipal cemetery on 22 March 1976, but later excavated and put into a common grave. At present, there are no plans to begin exhumations of the common grave.\n\nWhile the identification does not in itself prove the military killed Tenorinho, the manner of his murder and the way his body was discarded mirror the fate of countless others disappeared by the military.\n\nHis remains were discovered in the same area where other victims of clandestine detention centres had been dumped, cases later proven to be linked directly to the regime. He was also shot more than once, the typical way the military killed victims. While the typical registration of the death – taking the fingerprints and photos of the body – was conducted, his identification was not completed, a further hallmark of state crimes. The EAAF said they had no reason to doubt Tenorinho was a victim of state terrorism in the days before the military coup.\n\nTenorinho, who was born in Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, was one of 11 Brazilians kidnapped in Argentina during the dictatorship. He had no political affiliations, and it has long been surmised that he was picked up for how he looked: he wore glasses and had a long beard, features which the dictatorship associated with leftists.\n\nView image in fullscreen Tenorinho on his wedding day Photograph: c/o Family\n\nHe left behind his wife, Carmen, who was eight months pregnant at the time of his disappearance, and four other children. His parents, who for years sought answers to their son’s whereabouts, died around the 10th anniversary of his murder. His surviving family was informed of the identification this week.\n\nCarmen has passed away, along with two of the children. In a statement, the three remaining children said: “We received the news of the identification of our father’s body with surprise, of course, and with a mixture of relief and sadness. Relief because, finally, we can know with more certainty what happened to him in that sad March of 1976. Somehow, we will be closer – saddened by the confirmation that Tenório was a victim of violence and buried as an unknown, far from family, friends, music colleagues.”\n\nThey said his death deprived them of his company and forced their mother to raise five children alone, one who was born a month after their father’s disappearance. “Tenório never met his youngest son, nor his eight grandchildren,” the children wrote. “We still want and need answers. Who killed Tenório? Why? Why kill a man with no political involvement, who only lived for music?”\n\nTenorinho’s identification comes against an emerging climate of denialism in Argentina.\n\nIn late 2023, Argentina elected Javier Milei as its president – a hard-right leader who has been accused by rights organisations of attempting to “rewrite the history” of the dictatorship’s crimes. He has previously declared “there were no 30,000” people disappeared, and calling into question the extent of the military’s crimes. His party has also begun dismantling the Human Rights Secretariat, downgrading the body and recently laying off hundreds of workers.\n\nLast year six lawmakers from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party visited a jail to meet prisoners convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the 1976-1983 dictatorship, including Alfredo Astiz, the so-called “Angel of Death”. The politicians later claimed they were reviewing the living conditions of the detainees.\n\nThe office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity, nonetheless, is continuing its dictatorship-era work and is currently reviewing cases involving the discovery of unidentified corpses in public streets in the province of Buenos Aires between 1975 and 1983.\n\n“We have already identified approximately 600 files, 475 of which are under analysis,” said María Ángeles Ramos, one of the country’s lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship-era crimes.\n\nThe EAAF, which operates as a non-profit, is also committed to continuing its work. The team as become world-renowned, finding and identifying remains all over the world including genocide victims in Darfur, and the bodies of the Chilean president Salvador Allende and guerrilla icon Che Guevara.",

      "content": "Thousands of Brazilians have taken to the streets to rejoice at Jair Bolsonaro’s conviction for plotting a coup, as progressive politicians celebrated the historic move and rightwing figures linked to Donald Trump responded with anger and threats.\n\nChile’s leftwing president, Gabriel Boric, led regional congratulations of the decision to jail Bolsonaro for 27 years for leading a criminal organisation that sought to seize power after the far-right populist lost the 2022 election.\n\n“My respect to Brazilian democracy which fended off a coup attempt and today judges and convicts those responsible for it. They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”\n\nColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted. Those are the rules of democracy.”\n\nIn Latin America, 11 September is a date deeply associated with authoritarianism and violence: it was on this day in 1973 that Gen Augusto Pinochet launched a US-backed coup in Chile that ushered in 17 years of brutal military rule during which thousands were killed or forcibly disappeared.\n\nBut on Thursday jubilant crowds in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, celebrated how Bolsonaro’s conviction had given new meaning to the notorious date.\n\n“I’m really overflowing with joy. This is such a symbolic day for us,” said Renan Vidal, a bank worker who was also celebrating his 37th birthday as Bolsonaro and seven co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy.\n\n“It’s the best birthday present ever,” said Vidal, who wore a rainbow flag over his shoulders. “I’m part of the LGBT community and our community was one of the worst affected by the Bolsonaro government. So for us it’s a moment to commemorate,” he added as fireworks exploded above the throng.\n\nYucca Nani, 34, said her generation associated 11 September with another terrible event: the 9/11 attacks in the US. “It was the day that changed the history of the modern world,” she said, adding: “Now in Brazil [the date] has a new meaning, which is Bolsonaro’s conviction.”\n\nAlso at the street party was Beatriz Matos, an anthropologist whose husband, the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, was murdered in the Amazon with British journalist Dom Phillips during Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. Many believe Bolsonaro’s violent, pro-gun rhetoric and dismantling of environmental and Indigenous protections helped create the backdrop for the crime.\n\n“I feel relief, happiness and fire in my eyes,” Matos said of Bolsonaro’s demise. “We must celebrate. Justice is being done!”\n\nBeto Marubo, an Indigenous leader who is godfather to Pereira’s son, said: “This is a special day for us Indigenous people and for minorities … We were the ones who most suffered under Bolsonaro and this is a breath of justice.”\n\nThose festivities contrasted with the ire of Bolsonaro backers, in and outside of Brazil.\n\nThe US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, accused Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge who oversaw Bolsonaro’s trial, of “laying waste to the rule of law” and “driving relations between our two great nations to their darkest point in two centuries”.\n\nBolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has spent months lobbying Trump officials over his father’s fate, told Reuters he expected “a firm response with actions from the US government” after Thursday’s ruling.\n\nDescribing Bolsonaro as the victim of a “political execution”, Trump has hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and announced sanctions and visa revocations against supreme court judges and other officials.\n\nAsked on Thursday if he was planning further sanctions, Trump replied: “I thought he was a good president of Brazil and it’s very surprising that [this conviction] could happen.”\n\n“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” he added.\n\nTrump’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, said: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch-hunt.​”\n\nAt the carnival-style party in Brasília, revellers shrugged off those US warnings – as did Brazil’s foreign ministry which said “threats like the one made today by [Rubio] … will not intimidate our democracy”.\n\n“Let them do it,” Vidal said of possible further US pressure. “I think Brazil’s institutions are very solid and we will not cave in to Trump’s sanctions, however powerful his country may be.”\n\nA carnival parade called the Victory of Democracy Procession is planned in Rio on Friday night.",

      "content": "British authorities may have well-founded concerns about the cyber-spying threat from vehicles made in China, but it turns out the country’s manufacturers have security worries of their own.\n\nInsurers have told Chinese carmakers they need certain critical modifications for vehicles on British streets: namely, tougher locking devices to make them harder to steal.\n\nWith an average of 11 reported vehicle thefts an hour in the UK, and car crime comparatively rare under Beijing’s strict authoritarian regime, industry sources said it had been a “swift learning curve”.\n\nAdditions to cars exported to the UK from China have ranged from the simply mechanical, such as lockable wheel nuts and an extra layer of steel around the car door locks, to software to detect and guard against unauthorised entry.\n\nSales of Chinese cars have risen sharply in Britain this year, now accounting for about one in 12 of all new cars sold, including those made by MG and electric car firm BYD. New entrants such as Chery, which started to sell its own-brand petrol SUVs this month, have sold about 20,000 new cars in the UK since launching the Omoda and Jaecoo brands here earlier this year.\n\nNew models for import are assessed for risk on behalf of insurers, with tests including a two-minute “attack test”, whose results led to a range of Chinese prototypes being beefed up against car thieves.\n\nBen Townsend, the head of automotive at Thatcham Research, a vehicle risk intelligence company, said: “We’ve worked closely with Chinese vehicle manufacturers advising on vehicle security enhancements for the UK market.\n\n“In China, vehicle crime is not the same challenge we experience in the UK and Europe, so certain anti-theft features – like immobilisers, door shielding to prevent access to internal locking mechanisms, and software-based intrusion detection – haven’t historically been prioritised.”\n\nHe added: “These features often don’t require major structural interventions, which means they can be applied to completed new models, and we’ve found Chinese brands to be highly responsive and agile in implementing improvements.”\n\nChery executives said modifications had been swiftly delivered in the Chinese production process. Factory and other staff typically work a six-day week, on lower wages that have contributed to Chinese cars underpricing western comparators.\n\nOli Lowe, the UK head of product for Chery UK, said the Chinese manufacturer had dedicated regional research and development centres to get its cars ready for sale here. He said: “Simple but crucial adaptations, such as the addition of locking wheel bolts, ensure that vehicles not only meet local requirements but also deliver enhanced security and customer confidence for our buyers in the UK.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hardest hit areas included Makinohara and Yoshida, where vehicles were overturned and more than 1,200 structures were damaged. Since records began in 1961, Japan has experienced 13 level 3 tornadoes, but none have reached level 4.\n\nThe tornado occurred as a result of unstable conditions from Tropical Storm Peipah, which made landfall in Japan’s Kōchi prefecture on the same day, striking near the city of Sukomo. The storm unleashed torrential rain and powerful winds, causing damage across the region. Peipah injured 24 people, damaged or destroyed more than 40 homes and knocked out power to nearly 14,000 residents.\n\nBefore the storm, authorities issued evacuation orders affecting more than 600,000 residents, urging caution against flooding and landslides. Shimokitayama, a village in Nara prefecture, recorded 80mm of rain in one hour, while in the city of Kumano 63mm of ran fell within the same timeframe.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hurricane Kiko gathers steam north of Hawaii.

Kiko, which formed on 31 August, had sustained wind speeds of 110mph on Sunday as it dropped to category 2 strength. By Tuesday, the system was officially downgraded to tropical storm status.\n\nKiko veered north of the Hawaiian islands and by Wednesday its remnants hovered near the northern tip of Kaua’i, with sustained winds falling by about 40mph as the storm continued to lose strength. Kiko’s presence is still being felt across the state, though, with forecasters predicting large storm swells, locally heavy rainfall, gusty winds and dangerous rip currents. These hazardous conditions still pose serious risks to surfers and beachgoers alike.",

      "content": "North Korea has executed people for distributing foreign television shows, including popular South Korean dramas, as part of an intensifying crackdown on personal freedoms, according to a UN human rights report.\n\nSurveillance has grown more pervasive since 2014 with the help of new technologies, while punishments have become harsher – including the introduction of the death penalty for offences such as sharing foreign TV dramas, the report said.\n\nThe curbs make North Korea the most restrictive country in the world, according to the 14-page document published on Friday, which was based on interviews with more than 300 witnesses and victims who had fled the country and reported the further erosion of freedoms.\n\nJames Heenan, head of the UN human rights office for North Korea, told a Geneva briefing that the number of executions for normal and political crimes had increased since Covid-19-era restrictions.\n\nAn unspecified number of people have already been executed under the new laws for distributing foreign TV series, including the popular K-dramas from its southern neighbour, he added.\n\n“Under laws, policies and practices introduced since 2015, citizens have been subjected to increased surveillance and control in all parts of life,” the report’s conclusion said.\n\nThe sweeping UN review comes more than a decade after a landmark UN report found that North Korea had committed crimes against humanity. The study covered developments since 2014.\n\nNorth Korea’s Geneva diplomatic mission and its London embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNorth Korea, officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said in response to UN rights investigators that it rejected a UN human rights council resolution authorising the latest report.\n\nSometimes children are made to work in forced labour, including “shock brigades” for tough sectors such as coal mining and construction, Heenan said from Seoul.\n\n“They’re often children from the lower level of society, because they’re the ones who can’t bribe their way out of it, and these shock brigades are engaged in often very hazardous and dangerous work,” said Heenan.\n\nThe report also found some limited improvements, such as reduced use of violence by guards in detention facilities, and new laws that appear to strengthen fair trial guarantees.",

      "content": "More than 300 South Korean workers arrived at Incheon international airport on Friday afternoon, ending a week-long ordeal that began with the US Department of Homeland Security’s largest ever single-site raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and has left South Korea questioning whether it can trust its closest ally.\n\nThe 316 Koreans, along with 14 workers of other nationalities, landed shortly after 3pm local time on a chartered Korean Air flight after being detained since 4 September at a Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site in Georgia.\n\nThere was widespread anger across the political spectrum in South Korea at the behaviour of the US authorities, with one newspaper referring to the workers being treated like “prisoners of war” and another describing Koreans as feeling stabbed in the back by their closest ally.\n\nThe workers had requested privacy, and the assembled media kept their distance as the returnees emerged in small groups to board waiting buses. Most wore face masks and carried only small bags; many looking worn out but bearing the weary relief of people whose ordeal had finally ended.\n\nAddressing reporters, the presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, said he had come to offer words of encouragement. “We did our best, but I’m sorry we couldn’t bring them back to their homeland sooner,” he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen South Korean workers freed after days of detention in the US arrive at Incheon. Photograph: AP\n\n“We’re in an age of new normal in dealing with the United States,” Kang said. “The standard changes every time and constantly there has to be deal-making, not only on tariffs, but it’ll also be the case with security issues.”\n\nThe workers had been building a $4.3bn (£3.2bn) battery plant, which is crucial to Hyundai’s electric vehicle ambitions in the US. Most were employed by LG Energy Solution or its subcontractors.\n\nThe detention stemmed from workers using B1 business visas and the 90-day visa waiver programme (Esta) for what US authorities deemed actual employment rather than permitted activities such as meetings or training.\n\nKorean companies have long relied on this “grey zone” because the official H-1B work visas take months to obtain and South Korea lacks the dedicated quota allocations that other US trade partners enjoy. Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice.\n\nThe South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, delivered his sharpest warning yet to Washington on Thursday, stating that Korean businesses would “hesitate to make direct investments” if the US failed to resolve visa issues quickly.\n\nView image in fullscreen A television at Incheon airport on Friday, showing South Korean detainees lined up against a bus after the raid by US federal agents. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty\n\n“Korean businesses that have entered the United States are likely in a state of serious bewilderment,” he said. “This isn’t long-term permanent employment, but to establish facilities and equipment for factories; we need technicians to install machinery and equipment. The US doesn’t have such personnel, and they won’t give visas for [our workers] to stay and work.”\n\nThe workers’ departure from Georgia was delayed by a day after President Donald Trump offered to let them stay and train Americans, but only one person chose to remain.\n\nSouth Korea’s foreign minister, Cho Hyun, flew to the US to meet his counterpart, Marco Rubio, securing assurances that workers would not be restrained while being transported.\n\nThe concession addressed a particularly sensitive grievance after ICE’s release of video footage showing Korean workers being led away in chains, evoking historical experiences of subjugation by foreign powers.\n\nThe episode has generated unprecedented public anger. A survey by the local broadcaster MBC found 68% of respondents believed the US government “did not show consideration for South Korea as an ally” in handling the situation.\n\nKorean media responses were scathing across the political spectrum. Seoul Economic Daily described workers being treated like “prisoners of war”; the conservative Chosun Ilbo called it a “merciless arrest operation” representing a “breach of trust”; while the progressive Hankyoreh asked: “Is this what you do to an ally?” and described Koreans feeling “backstabbed” after Lee’s recent meeting with Trump.\n\nAt the airport, a 75-year-old protester, Hong Jung-sik, reflected a nation’s anger when he said the detention of fellow citizens had left him feeling betrayed. “Trump, who do you think you are?” he shouted, describing the episode as a “national humiliation” and “evil behaviour”.",

      "content": "The conspirators used codenames to conceal their identities as they prepared for their mission: to plunge Brazil into chaos by assassinating a celebrity supreme court judge called Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nOn an encrypted messaging group, one plotter used the alias Brazil, another Japan and a third Austria.\n\n“Each of them had the name of a team,” Moraes said this week as he denounced the alleged plot to murder him as part of an attempt to destroy South America’s largest democracy.\n\nThe group of football-loving would-be assassins abandoned their task at the last minute.\n\n“I’m close to the position. Are you going to cancel the game?” the person codenamed Austria asked their associates on their Signal group at just before 9pm on 15 December 2022, as he lurked near Moraes’s home in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.\n\n“Abort,” replied “Germany”, according to a federal police report.\n\nThe cinematic plot, nicknamed Operation Copa 2022 (Operation World Cup 2022) and involving at least six special forces troops, was at the heart of this week’s historic trial of Brazil’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro. He was on Thursday sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to stage a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his leftwing opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula.\n\n“[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state,” said Moraes as he accused Bolsonaro of being the leader of a sprawling conspiracy, which included plans to assassinate Lula and the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, to stop them taking power on 1 January 2023.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters at a protest this month. Photograph: Luis Nova/AP\n\nMoraes said hitmen had planned to “neutralise” him using “extremely powerful weapons” capable of piercing his bullet-proof car; they also allegedly considered killing Lula during a public event with poison or drugs that would cause organ failure.\n\n“I’m someone who should be really thankful to be alive,” Lula said last year after the alleged poison plot was revealed.\n\nBolsonaro has denied engineering a coup or being involved in an assassination plot, calling such claims “a little story”.\n\nBut Moraes said there was “ample evidence” indicating the far-right politician was aware of Operation World Cup 2022, which the judge said was part of a larger intrigue called Green and Yellow Dagger.\n\nPolice investigators said a copy of the blueprint for a “clandestine operation” with “terrorist hallmarks” was printed out in the presidential palace on 6 December 2022 by an army general called Mário Fernandes. At the time Gen Fernandes, who was arrested last year, was a senior official in Bolsonaro’s administration.\n\n“This [plan] wasn’t printed out in a cave. It wasn’t printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government … at the same moment that president Jair Messias Bolsonaro was there,” Moraes told the court on Tuesday as Bolsonaro’s trial reached its conclusion.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alexandre de Moraes and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who said he was ‘someone who should be really thankful to be alive’. Photograph: Adriano Machado/Reuters\n\n“The planning is so detailed that it even details the chances of success, what the collateral damage might be, what weaponry should be used,” added Moraes.\n\nA copy of the Green and Yellow Dagger plan, obtained by federal police investigators, suggests plotters planned to use an arsenal that included assault rifles, a belt-fed machine gun and even a Swedish anti-tank weapon, used on the battlefield in Ukraine. “These are weapons of war commonly used by combat groups,” the police report says.\n\nAccording to the investigators, the plan to assassinate Moraes was aborted only because a court session was delayed – and, more importantly, the commanders of the army and air force refused to endorse Bolsonaro’s coup plot.\n\nBrazil has had more than a dozen coup attempts since it became a republic in 1889 but none, so far as is known, involved a plan to assassinate those being deposed.\n\nThe historian Lucas Pedretti said that did not necessarily mean such plots had not existed. Rather, the 2022 plot had come to light because, for the first time in history, the coup plotters had been investigated and put on trial.\n\nPedretti said the existence of the assassination plan was “shocking, but not so surprising”. The historian, who studies Brazil’s brutal 1964-85 military dictatorship, said the armed forces still promoted internally the idea that the bloody regime was a “necessary and legitimate response” to a supposed communist threat.\n\nQuick Guide Brazil's dictatorship 1964-1985 Show How did it begin? Brazil’s leftist president, João Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule. The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974. What happened during the dictatorship? Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”. It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay. But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel. It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures. How did it end? Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy. But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte. Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.

Pedretti said the group, set up during the cold war, still maintained the same “enemy elimination mindset”.\n\n“In Bolsonaro’s attempted coup, spearheaded by him and his generals, they simply put that logic and the expertise of the ‘kids pretos’ at the service of the coup-mongering political project,” Pedretti said.",

      "content": "Military history is littered with the corpses of apex predators.\n\nThe Gatling gun, the battleship, the tank. All once possessed unassailable power – then were undermined, in some cases wiped out, by the march of new technology.\n\n“Speed and stealth and firepower,” the head of the Australian Submarine Agency, Jonathan Mead, told the Guardian two years ago of Australia’s forthcoming fleet of nuclear submarines. “The apex predator of the oceans.”\n\nBut for how much longer?\n\nIn the first quarter of the 21st century, nuclear submarines have proven a formidable force: essentially undetectable deadly attack weapons. Some also carry a vital “second-strike” deterrent effect: any attack on a country armed with nuclear-powered submarines is made with the knowledge that retaliation is certain – from a warship hidden beneath the waves.\n\nBut a drumbeat of declarations – much of it speculative, but most of it from China, the very nation the Aukus pact was established to counter – report rapid developments in submarine-detection technologies: vast networks of acutely sensitive sonar arrays; quantum sensing; improved satellite tracking able to spot tiny perturbations in the ocean’s surface; technologies that detect minute disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field; real-time AI processing of vast reams of data.\n\nCould emerging technologies render the last opaque place on Earth – the oceans – transparent?\n\nIt may not be so binary. The oceans may become, in parts, less impenetrable: key contested sea lanes and littoral areas may be intensely surveilled, while remote, deep trenches remain arcane.\n\nForecasting a future conflict is fraught. But the consequences for Australia, having dedicated an extraordinary $368bn towards its Aukus nuclear submarine fleet, are immense: will the apex predator of today become the prey of tomorrow?\n\nOne brutal assessment put it in stark terms: Australia’s fleet of nuclear-powered submarines may end up being “billion-dollar coffins”.\n\nQ&A What is Aukus pillar one? Show Pillar one of the Australia-UK-US (Aukus) agreement involves Australia being given the technology to command its own fleet of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. There are two stages: • First, Australia will buy between three and five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US, the first of these in 2032. But before any boat can be sold to Australia, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that the US relinquishing a submarine will not diminish its navy’s undersea capability. The US submarine fleet now has only three-quarters of the submarines it needs (49 boats of a force-level goal of 66). And there are significant concerns the US cannot build enough submarines for its own needs, let alone any for Australia. • Second, by the “late 2030s”, according to the \"optimal pathway\" outlined in Australia’s submarine industry strategy, the UK will launch the first specifically designed and built Aukus submarine for Britain’s Royal Navy. The first Australian-built Aukus submarine, for the Royal Australian Navy, will be in the water “in the early 2040s”. Australia will build up to eight Aukus boats, with the final vessels launched in the 2060s. Each of Australia’s nuclear submarines is forecast to have a working life of about three decades. Australia will be responsible for securing and storing the nuclear waste from its submarines - including high-level nuclear waste and spent fuel (a weapons proliferation risk) - for thousands of years. Aukus is forecast to cost Australia up to A$368bn to the mid-2050s. Photograph: Colin Murty/AFP Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nUnderwater arms race\n\nThere is an arms race under way underwater, dedicated to perfecting the technologies that can find submarines, and finding new ways to keep them hidden.\n\nVast resources are being poured into improving detection technologies and developing new ones: drones, sonobuoys, satellites, magnetometers, quantum sensors. All seek to shrink the spaces where submarines can hide.\n\nEverything is being monitored: the tiniest disturbance in waves across vast stretches of ocean, fractionally altered sea temperatures, faint magnetic disturbances, bioluminescent trails – each could give a tiny clue to a submarine’s path. Combined, they could reveal precisely where it is.\n\nAllied to the extraordinary data-processing power of artificial intelligence, these present a formidable threat to submarines’ invisibility. AI programs are able to cut through the “noise” of masses of information, spotting unseen patterns or finding connections between disparate pieces of data, imperceptible to a human analyst.\n\nMuch of the technological advancement is being driven by China.\n\nSubmarines, made of metal, cause tiny distortions in the Earth’s magnetic field as they move through the water, changes increasingly detectable to sophisticated magnetometers.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nLast year a research team from Shanghai Jiao Tong University reported the development of a new seabed sensor able to detect the faint electromagnetic waves generated by a rotating submarine propeller from nearly 20km away, about 10 times the previous detection range.\n\nAnd in a peer-reviewed study published in December, researchers in Xi’an claimed to have developed an airborne magnetometer that can track the persistent trace of a submarine’s magnetic wake.\n\nQuantum sensors, which can detect infinitesimally small perturbations in the environment at an atomic level, promise even greater sensitivity and accuracy.\n\nIn April scientists from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said they had developed a drone-mounted quantum sensor system that could track submarines with pinpoint accuracy. They claim the coherent population trapping atomic magnetometer is as sensitive as the MAD-XR system used by Nato countries but far cheaper, and so able to be deployed at a massive scale.\n\nThese are the technologies that are known about but, as Dr Anne-Marie Grisogono of Flinders University points out, if an adversary had a technology to accurately detect submarines, would it tell anyone?\n\nThe arms race is, of course, accelerating on both sides – designers are working on counter-detection measures to make submarines ever more covert: anechoic tiles to defeat or confuse sonar; cooling systems to weaken detection by thermal imaging or infrared detection by satellites; “degaussing” submarines to reduce magnetic signatures; and using pump-jet propulsors to produce less wake.\n\n‘We should be asking bigger questions’\n\nGrisogono was a co-author of the 2020 report Transparent Oceans, which argued that by the 2050s – as new Australian Aukus boats continued to be sent to sea – nuclear submarines “will be able to be detected in the world’s oceans because of the evolution of science and technology”.\n\nShe told Guardian Australia this year: “The likelihood that the oceans will become transparent at some time is basically 100%, it’s just in what time frame.\n\n“And they could become transparent much sooner. We’ve seen tremendous advances in artificial intelligence ... an accelerant for all of these detection technologies that we are seeing developed.”\n\nGrisogono argued that it may not be one technology that renders submarines detectable. She can envisage a future of “underwater meshes of networked sensors” using different technologies, all of which are expendable and none of which is critical to the network functioning.\n\n“It’s an adaptive mesh of cheap components, and importantly, it’s a distributed system, so you can’t really take it out,” she said. “You can lose quite a lot of them and still have a functioning network … and it’s cheap.\n\n“If your defensive system is really cheap and can take out really expensive assets from your opponent … the advantage is now to the defence, not to the attack.”\n\nGrisogono said Australia should use the opportunity before too much is committed to Aukus to re-evaluate its capacity, not to fight a war in 20 years but in 30, 40 or 50.\n\n“We should be asking bigger questions about our defence posture,” she said. “I think acquiring these nuclear-powered submarines really only makes sense if you’re wanting to contribute and join into much bigger conflicts in the region with the US.\n\n“Perhaps when the decision was first taken, the logic of Aukus might be defensible in some way. But does that still stand up now?”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Kym Smith/ADF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEssentially an uncrewed submarine powered by AI, the Ghost Shark, the government says, will be able to “conduct intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike at extremely long distances from the Australian continent”. With each one about the size of a minibus, they can be deployed from warships or launched off the coast.\n\nThe Guardian asked the defence minister, Richard Marles, whether the investment was a “hedge” against a future where crewed submarines were detectable.\n\n“We are very confident about Australia’s future submarines being fundamentally critical to Australia’s military capability,” Marles responded, saying the Ghost Sharks would “complement” crewed nuclear submarines.\n\n“While there’s a whole lot of advancements in technologies about detecting submarines, there’s also a lot of advancements in technologies around making submarines harder to detect, and we are really confident about … giving Australia a highly capable, long‑range submarine capability in the future.”\n\nStanding alongside the minister, Australia’s chief of navy, V Adm Mark Hammond, said he believed crewed submarines would grow more stealthy as efforts to detect them strengthened.\n\n“I’ve heard about ‘transparent oceans’ since I qualified in submarines 31 years ago, and nothing’s really changed: every advancement in detection capability is usually met by an advancement in encounter detection capability and increased stealth.”\n\nThe land and the air were “completely transparent”, Hammond said, “and no one has stopped building ships and aircraft.”\n\n“My personal belief is that the undersea battle space will continue to be increasingly congested, increasingly contested – but ultimately that is the most opaque environment on the planet, and I believe that our allies and partners will continue to enjoy the capability advantage in that space.”\n\nDetectable equals destroyable\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\nProf Peter W Singer, a strategist at the New America thinktank, cites Arthur C Clarke’s famed third law.\n\nHe tells the Guardian that the rapid pace of change across technological domains, accelerated by developments in AI, makes predicting future developments – especially beyond the span of a human or technological generation – increasingly fraught.\n\nAustralia’s first Aukus submarines are scheduled to be in the water in the 2040s. They will still be under construction into the 2060s.\n\n“Twenty years is a very long time when it comes to technology … what’s a generation for undersea warfare: is it every 30 years? Every 15 years? Every 10 years? We’re talking about a pretty substantial period of time,” Singer says.\n\nAn accelerating trend is “greater observation of the battlefield, and the worry that once stealthy systems might be detectable”.\n\n“If they’re detectable, they’re destroyable,” he says.\n\n“Military leaders around the world are wrestling with this – whether they are in the ADF, Nato, the US Navy, Marine Corps – there’s a trend where essentially the apex predators are looking around and wondering if they are now the prey.”\n\nThe Marianas Trench – largely uncharted and reaching depths beyond human exploration – might remain unknowable, Singer says, but key sea lanes in the South China Sea could be intensely surveilled.\n\nHe cites the cold war example of the GIUK Gap – naval choke points in the North Atlantic – which was populated by a battery of hydrophones designed to detect the passage of Soviet submarines.\n\nSinger predicts that undersea warfare of the future will not be a battle between crewed submarines but between hybrid fleets of new technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles, potentially working in concert with crewed subs. UUVs will be far cheaper and expendable in comparison with traditional submarines.\n\nThe terrestrial equivalent is Ukraine’s revolutionary use of cheap but lethal armed drones to counter Russia’s invasion. Expendable drones worth a few hundred dollars a unit are taking out tanks that cost tens of millions, halting entire offensives.\n\n“The uncrewed systems are not all going to be like a pet on a leash, they’re going to be increasingly operating on their own,” Singer says.\n\n“So you may have some physically large systems that need to go long distances and carry massive payloads, but you may also have smaller systems, maybe with less range but, because they’re smaller, they’re cheaper, and you can essentially fill the battle space with them.”\n\nThe upshot is a balancing act, Singer says – accepting that decision-makers have neither a perfect view of the future nor an unlimited budget.\n\n“I am not saying ‘don’t buy Virginia Class’ or ‘don’t buy Aukus’,” he says. “I think they do bring value. The question is how much of a bet do you want to make?”",

He said no one was injured.\n\nAttacks on energy infrastructure by both Russia and Ukraine come as United States President Donald Trump has said he is ready to sanction Russia, but only if all NATO allies agree to completely halt buying oil from Moscow and impose their own sanctions.\n\nAlso in Russia’s Leningrad, two freight trains in separate parts of the region derailed early Sunday, leaving a train driver killed and disrupting railway traffic, according to Governor Drozdenko.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn oil company in Russia’s Bashkortostan region will maintain production levels despite a drone attack on Saturday, the region’s Governor Radiy Khabirov said.\n\nThe incidents came shortly after an explosive device detonated on a section of rail track in Russia’s western Oryol region late Saturday, killing three people.\n\nUkraine did not claim responsibility for these incidents, as with previous ones hitting Russia’s railway network, but its military said it continues to target infrastructure used by Russia to deliver troops, fuel and ammunition to the front lines.\n\nUkraine’s Commander of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov told Ukrainian online video channel Novyny Live that the country may intentionally reduce the quality of 4G and 5G mobile communications in certain areas to prevent Russian drones from accessing the internet to transmit images during attacks.\n\nSeparately on Sunday, Russia said it had fired a Zircon (Tsirkon) hypersonic cruise missile at a target in the Barents Sea as part of joint military exercises with Belarus.\n\nRussia’s Defence Ministry said that long-range anti-submarine aircraft of the Northern Fleet’s mixed aviation corps were also involved in the “Zapad”, or West, joint strategic exercise, and that Su-34 supersonic fighter-bombers practiced a bombing strike against ground targets.\n\nIn the meantime, a drone breached Romanian airspace during a Russian drone attack on Ukrainian infrastructure overnight, with Romania dispatching fighter jets, which did not manage to shoot down the low-flying projectile before it left national airspace towards Ukraine.\n\nPoland also deployed aircraft and closed an airport in the eastern city of Lublin amid Russian drone strikes on Ukraine, with the move coming three days after Poland shot down Russian drones in its airspace with the backing of aircraft from NATO allies.\n\nNATO announced a new initiative on Friday to bolster the security of its Eastern European members in the wake of Russia’s violation of Polish airspace.\n\n“NATO is launching Eastern Sentry to bolster our posture even further along our eastern flank,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in Brussels during a joint news conference with NATO’s top commander in Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This military activity will commence in the coming days and will involve a range of assets from allies, including Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany,” Rutte added.",

      "content": "The US will be able to use a major naval precinct in Western Australia to dock and maintain its own nuclear-powered submarines, the federal government has confirmed, after committing $12bn to upgrade the shipyard.\n\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Sunday insisted the shipyard was an “Australian facility” as he downplayed suggestions the announcement was timed to appease US demands for increased Australian defence spending ahead of a potential face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump.\n\nThe Pentagon is also reviewing the Aukus deal.\n\n“Australia has always pulled our weight,” Albanese said of the government’s record on defence spending.\n\nOn Sunday, Albanese and the defence minister, Richard Marles, announced the $12bn commitment towards a major redevelopment of the Henderson naval shipyard south of Perth.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe Henderson precinct, which Marles said was estimated to cost $25bn over 10 years, will be used for docking and maintenance of Australia’s future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines as well as other naval shipbuilding projects.\n\nThe federal government plans to acquire three to five Virginia-class submarines from the US, starting from 2032, under the $368bn Aukus deal. US and UK-owned nuclear submarines will start rotating through HMAS Stirling, which is also in Western Australia, from 2027.\n\nAlbanese and Marles confirmed on Sunday that the US navy would be able to use Henderson, offering Washington a location to dock and maintain its submarines in the strategically significant Pacific region.\n\n“It is very much an Australian sovereign capability and that is its purpose,” Marles said.\n\n“But in respect of the maintenance of submarines, it is an Aukus facility. Now, ultimately, where the United States … maintain their submarines is a matter for them, but we absolutely anticipate that this will be a facility for them.”\n\nMarles said it was “fundamentally” an Australian announcement, but he had no doubt the decision would be welcomed in the US and the UK “because it is another step forward down the Aukus path”.\n\nThe US challenges in keeping its submarines in the water have been well-documented, with reports in 2023 suggesting almost 40% of its fleet was either in repair or awaiting maintenance amid workforce shortages and supply chain problems.\n\nThe Albanese government has already handed over $1.6bn to the US to support America’s shipbuilding capacity, with delivery of the first Virginia-class submarines to Australia in the early 2030s contingent on the US ramping up production.\n\nThe $12bn announcement for the Henderson shipyard follows public pressure from the Trump administration on Australia to lift its overall defence spending to 3.5% of GDP.\n\nThe commitment alone would fall well short of the US request, which amounts to about $40bn per year.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "title": "How the diamond engagement ring was invented – and sold around the world",
      "description": "The story of the diamond industry is one of monopolies, marketing and a month&#039;s salary or more.",
      "content": "The story of the diamond industry is one of monopolies, marketing and monthly salaries.\n\nFor decades, men in many countries were expected to spend two or even three months’ salary on a diamond engagement ring. This notion – and the iconic status of this gem – did not come about by accident.\n\nThe story goes back to 1870, when an Oxford University dropout named Cecil Rhodes set off to try his luck in the Cape Colony – modern-day South Africa, then a key British domain.\n\nSeeing the burgeoning diamond mining sector there, he began renting water pumps to diamond prospectors to prevent flooding of the mines. Then, over the next 20 years, Rhodes and his partner Charles Rudd proceeded to buy out hundreds, and then thousands, of small mines and “claims” – landholdings believed to contain diamonds – often for a pittance when their owners faced bankruptcy. Most miners were small operators, and Rhodes and Rudd had access to serious financial capital – notably the Rothschild banking empire – through their connections in London. As the two partners combined claims into larger mining units, overhead costs were reduced, and operations became more profitable.\n\nThe partners incorporated as De Beers Consolidated Mines, De Beers being the name of one of the mines they took over. By 1888, the company had a near-monopoly of South African claims and active diamond mines. With diamonds making up more than 25 percent of South African exports in 1900, De Beers became a powerhouse of the country’s economy, controlling some 90 percent of the world’s total diamond supply. Rhodes himself became a leading imperial figure, serving as prime minister of the Cape Colony from 1890 to 1896.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDe Beers was founded upon the racist policies of South Africa, which at the time was ruled by a white minority. The diamonds were extracted by Black miners earning subsistence wages, while De Beers’s white, European-origin shareholders enjoyed the profits.\n\nFollowing Rhodes’s death in 1902, control of De Beers ultimately passed to German-born entrepreneur Ernest Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer used a combination of financial incentives, strategic pressure, and diplomacy to persuade diamond suppliers in other countries to sell exclusively through the London-based and De Beers-owned “Central Selling Organization” (CSO), which in the 1930s became the unified sales channel for virtually all the world’s pre-cut diamonds. This enabled De Beers to stockpile diamonds, strictly control the release of stones to the global market, and effectively control prices – thereby creating an illusion of diamond scarcity worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, De Beers sought to enhance global demand for diamonds. In 1946, the company hired NW Ayer, a Philadelphia-based advertising agency, which one year later came up with the legendary slogan, “A diamond is forever”. This reframed the diamond and, specifically, the diamond engagement ring, as a symbol of “eternal love”. Through mass advertising, product placements in films, and celebrity PR – for example, lending jewellery to actors for major events – the campaign transformed the diamond market in the US, Europe and Japan.\n\nLasting 64 years, until 2011, this campaign was an astounding global success, with Ad Age magazine naming “A diamond is forever” as the top advertisement slogan of the 20th century. De Beers had manufactured a social norm, with the diamond engagement ring becoming almost mandatory in every developed market. While previously, a fiance might give a locket, a string of pearls, or a family heirloom to his intended, the number of American brides with a diamond ring climbed from 10 percent in 1940 to some 80 percent in 1980. In Japan, this figure rose from less than 5 percent in 1960 to 60 percent by 1981.\n\nBy the early 1950s, a diamond ring typically cost about $170 – about $2,300 in today’s money. De Beers advertisements initially suggested spending one month’s salary on an engagement ring, but by the 1980s, they were posing the question: “How can you make two months’ salary last forever?” Consumers appeared undeterred by the fact that a diamond’s resale value was typically just 50 percent of its original retail price (in contrast to gold, which has an “official” benchmark price set twice-daily).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time Marilyn Monroe sang “Diamonds are a girl’s best friend” in 1953 and the James Bond film “Diamonds Are Forever” was released in 1971, the diamond had become an icon.\n\n‘Cartel behaviour’\n\nBy the late 1970s, De Beers was annually distributing some 50 million diamond carats, with sales of more than $2bn in the US alone.\n\nBut as the 1980s rolled around, problems started to emerge for the company.\n\nDe Beers came under increasing scrutiny as the anti-apartheid movement gained momentum in Europe and the United States. Reports of its working conditions were shocking: low pay for mineworkers, minimum safety training and crowded dormitory housing surrounded by barbed wire and security checkpoints. This negative publicity put De Beers firmly in the spotlight as one of the prime beneficiaries of apartheid.\n\nDe Beers had already fought off allegations of “cartel behaviour” from the US Department of Justice. But in 1994, the company was indicted by a US grand jury on price-fixing charges. The company was barred from doing business in the US, where its executives could no longer set foot for fear of arrest.\n\nIn the late 1990s, reports that the diamond trade was financing brutal civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo further soured consumer sentiment.\n\nRebel groups targeted “alluvial” diamond mines – relatively easy-to-extract surface deposits, often in riverbeds – selling stones into the informal “grey” market and using the profits to buy weapons. The phrase “blood diamonds” entered the lexicon as investigative articles depicted enslaved children with pickaxes and shovels. De Beers was accused of turning a blind eye, if not outright complicity. The company’s sales declined more than 20 percent in two years, from about $5.7bn in 1999 to $4.45bn in 2001, with other diamond suppliers such as Angola’s Endiama and Russia’s Alrosa equally affected.\n\nBut since the early 1990s, changes had been afoot at De Beers. Facing pressure from South Africa’s newly elected African National Congress (ANC), it had introduced better conditions and wages for its mainly Black mineworkers. At the same time, Black South Africans also began to occupy some management roles.\n\nMeanwhile, the US indictment meant the company had no choice but to terminate its CSO in 2000, ushering in competition from other producers. Diamond prices, no longer set and dictated by the CSO, became more volatile, subject to fluctuating demand, economic cycles, and geopolitical conditions.\n\nTo counter the blood diamond backlash, De Beers helped implement the “Kimberley Process” in 2003, through which diamond dealers can trace the origin of diamonds and authenticate “clean’’ diamonds with a microscopic stamp.\n\nNot forever?\n\nToday, natural diamonds may have lost some of their allure with the rise of “lab-grown” stones and “diamond simulants” such as cubic zirconia, which are up to 90 percent cheaper than the mined variety and often distinguishable from the real thing only by experts using specialised equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past two years, the diamond industry has been hit by a “perfect storm” of cheaper synthetic stones, weak consumer demand in the US and China, sanctions against Russia and, more recently, high US tariffs. This has had a widespread adverse impact: the Antwerp World Diamond Centre (AWDC) reported that rough diamond imports dropped 35 percent in 2024, with overall trade declining by 25 percent year-on-year (from $32.5bn to $24.4bn) – and in the Indian gem processing hub of Surat, at least 50,000 diamond workers were rendered jobless in 2024. At least 80 diamond workers in India have died by suicide in the past two years.\n\nIn 2011, the Oppenheimer family sold its interest in De Beers to the London-based mining corporation Anglo American, another major shareholder, for just over $5bn. De Beers is now once more up for sale, again with a $5bn price tag, as Anglo American seeks to exit the declining diamond market in favour of copper, iron ore and rare earth minerals.\n\nDespite the volatile market conditions, total global consumer diamond sales were valued at approximately $100bn in 2024, with the average price of $6,750 for a diamond ring in the US, according to the Natural Diamond Council – about 1.3 months’ standard wage in the United States, but about eight months’ worth of the global median income. For those of greater means, London’s Harrods reportedly has a 228.31 carat, pear-shaped diamond available to view by private appointment – with a price estimated to be in excess of $30m.\n\nThis article is part of “Ordinary items, extraordinary stories”, a series about the surprising stories behind well-known items.\n\nRead more from the series:\n\nHow the inventor of the bouncy castle saved lives\n\nHow a popular Peruvian soft drink went ‘toe-to-toe’ with Coca-Cola\n\nHow a drowning victim became a lifesaving icon\n\nHow a father’s love and a pandemic created a household name\n\nHow Nigerians reinvented an Italian tinned tomato brand\n\nHow a children’s chocolate drink became a symbol of French colonialism",

The talks are aimed at halting Israel’s aggressive actions towards Syria and reaching some kind of security deal.\n\nIsrael has launched hundreds of strikes on military sites and assets across Syria since the fall of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December. It has also expanded its occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights by seizing the demilitarised buffer zone, a move that violated the 1974 disengagement agreement with Syria.\n\nOn Tuesday, Syria “strongly condemned” Israeli attacks on several sites in and around Homs city in the west of the country and around the coastal city of Latakia.\n\nThe Israeli air attacks represent “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic”, the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\nWhile Israel had for years waged a secretive campaign of aerial bombardment against Syria’s military infrastructure, its attacks on its neighbour have ramped up since the war on Gaza and the fall of al-Assad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late August, six Syrian soldiers were killed in an Israeli drone attack on Damascus, which came a day after a ground incursion into Syrian territory by Israeli troops.\n\nThe attacks on Syria come amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s promotion of a vision for a “Greater Israel“, a concept supported by ultranationalist Israelis that lays claim to the occupied West Bank and Gaza, as well as parts of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Jordan.\n\nAfter violence in southern Syria’s Suwayda on July 13 between Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze factions, government forces were sent in to quell the fighting. But the bloodshed worsened, and Israel carried out strikes on Syrian troops and bombed the heart of the capital, Damascus, under the pretext of protecting the Druze.",

      "content": "As Israel displaces thousands from the north of the enclave, concerns are growing about worsening conditions in the south.\n\nThousands of Palestinians are being displaced each day by Israel’s indiscriminate carpet bombing of Gaza City, which is killing dozens of civilians daily, with families fleeing south towards an uncertain fate in the repeatedly attacked and overcrowded al-Mawasi.\n\nMore than 6,000 people were forced to leave the besieged city on Saturday, according to the Palestinian Civil Defence, as the Israeli army continued its relentless bombardment of the area.\n\nSome 900,000 Palestinians are currently left in the city, but the number is decreasing rapidly.\n\nKhalil Matar, a displaced Palestinian fleeing south, said: “We keep moving. There are sick people with us, and we don’t know where to go. There are no safe zones.”\n\nMany of those who are leaving the north are heading on the forced evacuation threats of the Israeli army to al-Mawasi camp, where conditions have been described as beyond dire, crowded, and under-resourced even before the latest mass displacements.\n\nReports from al-Mawasi, which is often struck by Israeli strikes despite being a so-called “safe zone”, suggest that new arrivals are struggling to find space to pitch their tents.\n\n‘Famine is devouring us too’\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from the al-Mawasi, said the scenes there were “very chaotic” as more and more families arrived, with their belongings placed by the side of the road.\n\n“For almost a whole week, we’ve been trying to figure out a place to shelter in. I have a large family, including my children, my mother and my grandmother,” one displaced Palestinian man told Khoudary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Not only are missiles pouring down on our heads, but famine is devouring us too,” he said.\n\nThe man added that his family’s tent was not fit for purpose after two years of use, and that he was unsure where they would take shelter.\n\n“Displacement is as painful as eviscerating one’s soul out of the body. We don’t know where to take refuge,” he said. “I’m taking my family into the unknown.”\n\nSpeaking from al-Mawasi, displaced journalist Ahmed al-Najjar said the camp was not safe.\n\n“It’s called a safe zone, but we have been living here for months and we know for sure that it’s not safe,” he stressed.\n\n“How can I call it safe when Israel killed and bombed my own sister within this ‘safe zone’?”\n\nAl-Najjar also described being woken up by the “cries and horrific sounds of people being burned alive in a nearby tent”.\n\nGiven such dangers as well as the lack of space, some displaced Palestinians have told Al Jazeera that they will be returning to Gaza City from al-Mawasi, in an apparent trend of reverse displacement.\n\nFaraj Ashour, a displaced Palestinian who lost his legs in an Israeli attack, is one of those considering the return journey.\n\n“I went to al-Mawasi, but the costs were too high … and it was almost impossible to find a proper spot without paying extra,” Ashour said.",

      "content": "Qatar seeks a collective response to Israel, which has attacked several other countries as it pummels Gaza.\n\nLeaders from across the region are gathering in the Qatari capital to discuss a formal response to Israel’s strikes on Doha last week, which it said targeted Hamas leadership and reverberated through the Middle East and beyond.\n\nIsrael launched the missiles as Hamas members gathered in their Doha office to discuss a deal proposed by United States President Donald Trump to end Israel’s two-year genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nThe attack came hours after Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar claimed Israel had accepted the Trump proposal, which would release all 48 captives held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and a ceasefire.\n\nIsrael killed five Hamas members and a Qatari security official in the attack, although it did not kill the Hamas leadership it said it was targeting.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the attack on Thursday.\n\nHow is Qatar responding?\n\nQatar has invited leaders from Arab and Islamic countries for meetings that will culminate in the emergency Arab-Islamic summit on Monday.\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari told Qatar News Agency (QNA) that “the summit will discuss a draft resolution on the Israeli attack” that signifies another instance of “state terrorism practised by Israel”.\n\nA meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday will work on the draft, which is expected to add to the international chorus of condemnation for the Israeli attack.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, who met Trump in New York on Friday, said Qatar will pursue a collective response to the attack, which has put the entire region at risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQatar has long had a mediation role, working to end Israel’s war on Gaza and generate regional unity.\n\nIn the meetings on Sunday and Monday, it will leverage pro-Palestinian sentiment and opposition to Israel’s attacks that have been expressed across the region.\n\nWho is attending?\n\nLeaders from the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the 22-member Arab League will attend.\n\nIran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian is confirmed to attend, as are Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nOn Saturday, Iran’s security chief Ali Larijani issued what he called a “warning to Islamic governments” and said they must “form a ‘joint operations room’ against the madness” of Israel instead of resorting to mere statements.\n\nThe full list of dignitaries in attendance on Monday is yet to be confirmed.\n\nWhat can come out of the summit?\n\nAt the summit, a strongly worded statement against Israel is guaranteed.\n\nThe leaders will discuss potential ways they could take action to address Israeli aggression across the region.\n\nIsrael has also bombed Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen as its genocidal war on Gaza and military raids on the occupied West Bank continue relentlessly.\n\nThe sense of security enjoyed by Qatar and neighbouring states has been shattered, which could prompt them to seek new security or defence arrangements with the US that go beyond buying arms.\n\nThere are political considerations at play, however, especially with Washington still offering ironclad support to Israel despite growing international frustration.\n\nAs ministers and leaders arrived in Doha on Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio travelled to Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top leaders. Among other things, they are likely to discuss plans to annex large parts of the West Bank.\n\nThat plan has been described by the United Arab Emirates, a member of the US-sponsored Abraham Accords to normalise ties with Israel, as a “red line” that would undermine the agreement.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other regional states being eyed by Israel and the US as future members of the Accords are seen by analysts to be the furthest they have been for years from normalising relations with Israel.\n\nAmong the tools that states have at their disposal to respond to rogue aggression are acts like downgrading diplomatic ties.\n\nArab states like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE also have vast financial capabilities at their disposal as leverage, as well as large sovereign wealth funds with international investments that could impose curbs on Israel, including trade limitations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQatar has said part of its response will be legal, including through pursuing Israeli violations of international law.",

      "content": "In this article ORCL\n\nZS\n\nAVGO Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe latest earnings season has addressed investors' concerns about the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to the robust growth outlook and capital spending projections of many tech companies. Investors seeking exposure to companies that are well-positioned to capture AI-led growth can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who can help pick the stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on past performance.\n\nBroadcom\n\nSemiconductor company Broadcom (AVGO) reported impressive fiscal third-quarter results and issued solid guidance, thanks to AI tailwinds. AVGO stock rallied following the results, as the company stated that it has secured a new $10 billion customer. Citing strong fundamentals, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on Broadcom stock and boosted the price target to $400 from $325, saying that AVGO remains a top pick in semiconductors. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $396. Sur attributed Broadcom's strong results and solid revenue outlook for the October quarter to accelerating AI demand, stabilizing non-AI semiconductors, and impressive momentum in the VMware business. The 5-star analyst noted the 18% sequential growth in AVGO's Q3 FY25 AI revenue, with the company guiding a 19% quarter-over-quarter growth to $6.2 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter. He added that Broadcom is on track to deliver about $20 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2025. Sur believes that the new customer from whom Broadcom secured orders worth $10 billion is OpenAI, considering the AI inference use case and his prior research. The analyst now expects AI revenue to increase by 125% to $45 billion in fiscal 2026, followed by a 60% increase in fiscal 2027. Sur said the strength in AVGO's AI revenue supports his view that the company's internally developed custom AI chips offer meaningful differentiation, efficiency and improved economics. \"Despite macro volatility, Broadcom's diversified portfolio and product cycles support a solid revenue growth profile,\" concluded Sur. Sur ranks No. 39 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks.\n\nZscaler\n\nNext on this week's list is Zscaler (ZS), a cybersecurity company that recently delivered strong results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions. Impressed by the Q4 FY25 print, Stifel analyst Adam Borg reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock and raised the price forecast to $330 from $295. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" stock on ZS stock with a price target of $298. Borg stated that Zscaler delivered solid results, consistent with Stifel's positive checks. He added that the company's Q4 FY25 performance was strong across key metrics, driven by strong execution and demand for the company's broadening Zero-Trust portfolio. Borg was particularly pleased with robust growth in billings and remaining performance obligations. Notably, RPO growth (31%) accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. The 5-star analyst is optimistic about the adoption of Zscaler's offerings across emerging areas, like AI security. Borg is also upbeat about the company's newer solutions like Z-Flex. He continues to believe that \"Zscaler's leading-portfolio helps improve an organization's security posture, drives vendor consolidation, and reduces costs.\" Bord expects Zscaler to sustain at least high-teens top-line growth and margin expansion in the coming years, driven by multiple drivers. Borg ranks No. 324 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 77% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.9%.

      "content": "A TV monitor displays a picture of Tyler Robinson, the suspected of killing Charlie Kirk on September 11, in Orem, Utah, on September 12, 2025.\n\nAs the search unfolded for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk's assassin, with the suspect identified on Friday as Tyler Robinson, law enforcement parsed every possible lead. One piece of evidence they homed in on: a forearm print taken from the sniper's position.\n\nBefore Robinson's apprehension Friday morning as a result of very human methods — it has been reported that Robinson offered what may have been a form of confession to family members, who then shared the information, leading to his surrender — FBI agent Robert Bohls said investigators had collected a \"footwear impression, a palm print and forearm imprints\" from the crime scene for analysis.\n\nForearm imprints are not a commonly collected piece of evidence, according to experts CNBC spoke with.\n\n\"It's very unusual,\" said Patrick McClain, a Texas-based criminal defense attorney and retired Marine Corps military judge. McClain explained that typically, when a forearm print is mentioned, authorities have collected DNA or other skin residue from the surface against which the forearm was pressed.\n\n\"It's merely a mold from an imprint left from remaining in a prone shooting position with forearms on the deck for a period of time,\" said Jeff Wenninger, founder and CEO of Law Enforcement Consultants, who has worked with the LAPD's elite Metropolitan Division and with the Secret Service in protecting dignitaries. \"It would be similar to a shoe or boot print that they lift with a mold,\" he added.\n\nWenninger says that a forearm print can be used to corroborate identification purposes, such as unique characteristics like scarring or the imprint of known clothing worn.\n\n\"Like fingerprints, a forearm print can be unique enough for identification if it's of sufficient quality,\" he said.\n\nIt could also have a forensic value if biological material like sweat, body oils, or touch DNA can be recovered, and along with other evidence, it can corroborate or contradict witness statements or video footage.\n\nNew technology is giving the forearm a wider window into a possible suspect. Physical impressions have been utilized in forensic investigations for years, Wenninger said, but in recent years, the methodologies for identifying and comparing specific meaningful markings have evolved, and the scanning technology for analyzing imprints has improved so much that \"it seems new.\"\n\n3D scanning has revolutionized this science, turning the forearm print into a reservoir of previously untapped information. An imprint alone cannot determine factors such as ethnicity and gender, and investigators would still be reliant on whether DNA or other biological evidence has been obtained from the imprint.\n\n\"It's a newer exploration in forensics, including other skin prints. But it's not like a finger/palm print that is 100% unique,\" said Toby Braun, CEO and Founder of American Special Investigative Group, which specializes in executive protection, threat-intelligence monitoring, and complex investigations.\n\nAccording to Braun, a forearm print won't ID a person from a database like a fingerprint would. \"A forearm print is not considered a primary form of forensic evidence in the same way that a fingerprint is,\" he said.",

      "title": "OpenAI's spending spree is powering the tech industry. Oracle is the latest winner",
      "description": "Oracle’s stock surge and Broadcom’s breakout underscore OpenAI's influence across Silicon Valley.",
      "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks to members of the media as he arrives at a lodge for the Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference on July 8, 2025 in Sun Valley, Idaho. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nOracle 's historic stock surge this week marked the latest chapter in the story of a single private company that's dominated the tech landscape for almost three years: OpenAI. In Oracle's blowout earnings report, OpenAI was a key catalyst due to a massive amount of money the artificial intelligence startup expects to spend on cloud computing technology in the coming years. It's becoming a familiar theme. A week earlier, Broadcom shares popped almost 10% after the chipmaker and software vendor said it forged a $10 billion deal to build custom processors for a customer that analysts said was OpenAI. Among tech's megacaps, Microsoft has the closest link to OpenAI, having invested more than $13 billion in the company and serving as its key cloud partner for six years. Nvidia's march to becoming the world's most valuable company is intimately tied to OpenAI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) sit at the heart of large language model development and are essential for running big AI workloads. Those four companies alone — Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft and Nvidia — have seen their combined market caps swell by over $4.5 trillion since OpenAI burst into public view with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. And those gains are a big reason why the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have sustained sharp rallies, with both benchmarks closing at a record on Friday. OpenAI's outsized influence has some market experts understandably concerned. It remains a cash-burning startup that's governed by a nonprofit parent.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe company's $500 billion valuation is supported by a small number of investors betting that OpenAI will prevail in the face of hefty competition from the likes of Meta and Google as well as other highly-valued newcomers like Anthropic and any number of players out of China. \"While we love ChatGPT, OpenAI is still a not for profit limited in its ability to raise capital,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview with CNBC. Luria, who recommends holding Oracle shares, dug into the company's numbers as the stock was in the midst of a 36% jump on Wednesday, its biggest gain since 1992. In its quarterly earnings report late Tuesday, Oracle said it signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers during the period. One of those was with OpenAI, which said previously that it agreed to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity with Oracle. Investors knew, based on a filing with the SEC in June, that Oracle signed a $30 billion cloud contract with an unnamed company that's set to begin in two years. CNBC confirmed a Wall Street Journal report from Wednesday that OpenAI has agreed to spend $300 billion in computing power over about five years, starting in 2027. In the two trading days after its historic pop, Oracle's stock retreated, dropping more than 6% on Thursday and another 5% on Friday, as other investors began sharing Luria's concerns. The new revelations about OpenAI's massive cloud commitment provided a clearer sense of Oracle's expanding backlog. Oracle said its performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, surged 359% from a year earlier to to $455 billion. Luria said the concentration of Oracle's backlog with a single customer \"significantly reduces\" enthusiasm, particularly if \"more than 90% came from OpenAI.\" Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nAltman's open wallet\n\nOpenAI has made big commitments to several other cloud providers, including CoreWeave and Google , and reportedly plans to put $19 billion toward Stargate, a project President Donald Trump announced in January to bolster AI infrastructure investments in the U.S. Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which is separately leading a planned $40 billion investment in OpenAI. Luria said the takeaway is that \"Sam Altman has the gumption to sign very large checks without needing to worry about whether those can ever be cashed.\" OpenAI declined to comment. While OpenAI will be losing money for the foreseeable future, the company is expecting revenue growth to continue at a breakneck pace. After hitting $10 billion in annual recurring revenue in June, OpenAI is on pace for that number to reach $125 billion by 2029, CNBC confirmed. And on Thursday, OpenAI got a step closer to formalizing its transition to a for-profit entity. The company said its nonprofit parent will continue to have oversight over the business and will own an equity stake of more than $100 billion as the commercial entity becomes a public benefit corporation. OpenAI needs the restructuring to take place by year-end in order to secure the entirety of the $40 billion from its latest financing round. For Oracle, the massive increase in OpenAI spending has landed the company within shouting distance of the trillion-dollar club, which currently includes eight tech peers. Oracle's market cap climbed to about $930 billion on Wednesday before retreating to $830 billion to close the week. Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told CNBC's \"Money Movers\" that he's still skeptical of Oracle's prospects in AI. The company has spent years trying to play catchup in cloud infrastructure, where it trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Deeter said Oracle remains a \"B-level hyperscaler\" without meaningful positions in AI software or chips. \"Two days ago, we all thought Oracle was essentially nowhere in AI,\" Deeter said, following the earnings report. \"They announce this mega-deal, people think they're the next great hyperscaler – and I don't buy that part.\" WATCH: Byron Deeter on Adobe and Oracle",

      "description": "While there is an opportunity to improve Performance Food's profitability, the main catalyst here is a potential merger with US Foods.",
      "content": "Business: Performance Food Group is a food and foodservice distribution company that operates through three segments: foodservice, specialty (formerly \"Vistar\"), and convenience. Its foodservice segment distributes a line of national brands, customer brands, and its proprietary-branded food and food-related products to independent and multi-unit chain restaurants and other institutions. Its specialty segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. Its convenience segment distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice related products and other items to convenience stores across North America. It markets and distributes over 250,000 food and food-related products to customers across the United States from about 144 distribution facilities to over 300,000 customer locations in the food-away-from-home industry.\n\nActivist: Sachem Head Capital Management\n\nPercentage ownership: ~2 - 4%\n\nAverage Cost: n/a\n\nActivist Commentary: Sachem Head was founded in 2013 by Scott Ferguson, the first investment professional hired at Pershing Square, where he worked for nine years. Sachem Head has a history of solid value investing, but we believe that they really found their activist stride in 2020 with their investment in Olin . Scott Ferguson took a board seat at Olin - the first public company board seat he took in an investment that was not part of a group - and created tremendous value there. More recently, after nominating a majority director slate, Sachem Head settled for three board seats at US Foods, and most recently settled for a board seat at Twilio in April 2024. Taking board seats signifies both commitment and contribution and this philosophy and style is really paying off for Sachem Head.\n\nWhat's happening\n\nOn Aug. 21, Sachem Head delivered a nomination notice for the following four candidates to stand for election to Performance Food Group's Board at the 2025 Annual Meeting: Scott D. Ferguson, David A. Toy, R. Chris Kreidler and Karen M. King. Additionally, Sachem Head has urged the company to explore a potential business combination with US Foods and, absent a transaction, further improve margins.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nPerformance Food Group is the third largest foodservice distribution company in North America, behind Sysco and US Foods , which all together command approximately 38% market share. The company operates through three segments. The core foodservice segment (61.8% of EBITDA) distributes national, customer, and proprietary-branded food and food-related products. Convenience (20.6%) distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products to convenience stores. Specialty (17.61%) distributes candy, snacks, beverages and other items to specialty vendors.\n\nOn Aug. 21, Sachem Head delivered a nomination notice for the following four candidates to stand for election to PFG's board at the 2025 Annual Meeting: Scott D. Ferguson (founder and managing partner of Sachem Head), David A. Toy, R. Chris Kreidler and Karen M. King.\n\nAdditionally, Sachem Head has urged PFG to explore a potential business combination with US Foods and, absent a transaction, further improve margins.\n\nFerguson and Toy previously served together on the US Foods board as part of a Sachem Head Cooperation Agreement. At US Foods, Sachem Head helped install a new CEO and management team, which catalyzed a successful turnaround for the company. Since Sachem Head filed its 13D at US Foods, the company's stock has more than doubled.\n\nThe other two candidates have just as much experience: Kreidler was the CFO for Sysco for six years and King is an executive vice president at McDonald's and serves on the Aramark board. This is an all-star team of nominees that are well positioned to navigate PFG through operational improvements and a strategic evaluation.\n\nWhile there is an opportunity to improve operating margins at the company, the main catalyst here is the merger with US Foods. The potential synergies that could be attained in such a combination make it very hard to ignore. These synergies are evident from another proposed industry consolidation, Sysco's 2013 attempt to merge with US Foods. Publicly, this deal was projected to deliver annual synergies of at least $600 million within three to four years relative to US Foods' $826 million of EBITDA at the time. In other words, the projected synergies represented more than 70% of US Foods' EBITDA, and the numbers that were thrown around privately were even larger. This is an extraordinary figure, and largely unique to the food distribution landscape and the amount of purchasing, logistics and warehouse rationalization synergies that these companies have. Extrapolating these numbers to a US Foods/PFG merger and applying similar levels of synergies using the EBITDA of PFG's foodservice segment ($1.2 billion), which holds most of the synergistic potential, a merger could be expected to yield $800 million to upwards of $1 billion in synergies. Moreover, if there is anyone who could validate this analysis, it would be Sachem director nominee Chris Kreidler, who was the CFO of Sysco at the time.\n\nHowever, the Sysco/US Foods deal was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission due to antitrust concerns centered around a merger of #1 and #2 that would eliminate Sysco's only national competitor. There are a few reasons why a merger between US Food and Performance Food Group may have a different outcome. First, this would be a merger of the second and third largest players, rather than first and second; and unlike Sysco, PFG is not a national competitor, with little to no footprint on the West Coast. Additionally, today's regulatory environment under the Trump administration is significantly more favorable than it was when the Sysco deal was reviewed under the Obama administration. While any approved deal would likely require divestitures in certain markets and there is no guarantee of an approval, with potential synergies like this, the Board owes it to its shareholders to at least explore the possibility of a US Food merger. And that is all Sachem Head is asking. They are not forcing the company to sell but rather pleading with them to evaluate this potentially lucrative opportunity that has been brought to them.\n\nIn July 2025, US Foods confirmed in an 8-K filing that they had approached PFG about a potential combination. But it takes two to tango and, so far, PFG has not meaningfully engaged with them. Given this current sentiment, sincere consideration of this transaction appears unlikely to occur without asserting a little pressure on the board, and Sachem Head is doing that in the form of a threatened proxy fight that they would have an excellent chance of winning. Not only are proxy fights about the power of the argument, and Sachem Head has a great one here, but the company's shareholder base contains many alternative asset managers that are more likely to support an activist agenda like this than the traditional index funds. These shareholders have a history of being receptive to good activist campaigns and the potential upside this plan could deliver and would also be impressed by the strong slate Sachem Head is nominating should be enough for them to hear the fund out.\n\nMoreover, there is speculation that even prior to Sachem Head's engagement, changes in the C-Suite were imminent. For more than 17 years, the company has been run by CEO George Holm, a widely respected industry leader. Now, it has been rumored that Holm will soon step down, likely to be replaced by the company's President Scott E. McPherson. A CEO transition like this creates the perfect time for a strategic transaction for everyone involved, except maybe McPherson. When two companies of similar size merge in a merger of equals, valuation is often the easy part. It is the social issues that are often the dealbreakers. And that dynamic could be exacerbated when the merger is proposed just as the sitting president is finally getting the call up to CEO. However, McPherson hasn't been a PFG lifer and has only been with the company for a year and a half, so the social issues surrounding leadership of the surviving entity should be achievable.\n\nBoards and their advisors and certain shareholders often viscerally oppose any type of \"sell the company\" activism, and often for good reason. Often, we are the biggest critics of that type of short-term activism that gives the future value creation to a private equity fund or a strategic acquirer instead of the shareholders. But a \"merge the companies\" thesis is different, especially when there are such compelling synergies that create value for all shareholders. A transaction between players of this size would have to come primarily in the form of a stock-based combination, which would allow PFG and US Foods shareholders to participate in the long-term value creation that would arise from the merger.\n\nWe expect that an experienced activist like Sachem Head will be able to convince the board of this and a great outcome for shareholders would be a settlement to add two to three directors to the board along with the establishment of a new committee focused on evaluating strategic alternatives with at least one of the new directors on that committee. That could lead to a transaction that could be a windfall for everyone involved.\n\nBut if ultimately an evaluation is done and a standalone path is determined to be the best outcome, this remains a strong company and a high return on capital business with room to improve on costs and margins around the edges – areas which Sachem Head's directors would also be valuable.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

      "content": "Passengers walk through the entrance of a TSA PreCheck in Terminal One at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Feb. 1, 2017. Armando L. Sanchez | Chicago Tribune | Getty Images\n\nFinding a cheap flight can at times feel as tough as scoring a decent snack on an airplane. But travel experts generally agree on one piece of advice to getting a good deal on airfare: Be flexible. \"It's our No .1 advice, always, for travelers\" looking for deals, said James Byers, head of the product team at Google Flights. Flexibility may mean flying midweek instead of during the weekend, or perhaps traveling outside of peak season for a particular destination, he and other experts said. \"Try not to lock yourself into a really specific date,\" Byers said. Even shifting travel by a day or two in either direction can make a \"huge difference,\" he said.\n\nThe cheapest days to fly\n\nMondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are generally the cheapest days to fly. Tickets are 13% less expensive than those for weekend flights, according to new Google Flights data. Google examined average round-trip airfares from Jan. 1, 2021, through Aug. 1, 2025. It analyzed four-day to 16-day trips departing from the top 4,000 markets in the U.S. Midweek departures are a \"simple way\" to save $42 a ticket, or about 14%, on average, for domestic airfare, according to a 2025 travel hacks report by Hopper.\n\nwatch now\n\nSunday is often the most expensive day to fly, Hayley Berg, Hopper's lead economist, wrote in the report. It's typically a busy day in airports as people fly home from weekends away, she wrote. \"Travelers thinking about a weekend getaway can save significantly by departing mid-week and returning on Saturday or Monday, instead of Sunday,\" Berg wrote.

For example, flying on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving is likely the most expensive day to fly around that particular holiday, said Sally French, a travel analyst at NerdWallet. As an added bonus, skipping weekend travel can also yield big hotel discounts. Checking in on Friday or Saturday and staying through Sunday generally means paying a premium exceeding 20%, or about $50 more per night, relative to the cheapest days of the week to check in, such as Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, according to Hopper data.\n\nDon't fall for this travel 'myth'\n\nCan't afford the hotel? Travelers can pay staff to let them take photos in the pool. Daniloandjus | E+ | Getty Images\n\nMany travelers fall for the \"myth\" that the day of the week on which they purchase their flight has a big financial effect, French said. \"It's not true,\" she said. \"It's not the day that you book [that's important], it's the day that you fly.\" Tuesday has historically been the cheapest day of the week to book, but it's only 1.3% cheaper than Sunday, the most expensive day, according to the Google Flights analysis. \"If I were giving my friends and family advice on what to look for, it'd be lower on the list as a factor,\" Byers said. \"I wouldn't say, 'Wait until Tuesday.'\"\n\nTravel outside of peak season\n\nThese alternative travel trends offer something different than the typical vacation. Alexandr Dubynin | Moment | Getty Images\n\nFlexibility on a more macro level can also help reduce your airfare, French said. \"Just going in a less crowded month can be helpful,\" she said. This might mean traveling during a destination's shoulder season or offseason, experts said. Airfare generally peaks in mid-summer and drops as early fall approaches, Berg wrote. For example, domestic travelers in 2024 saved 40%, on average, or about $150, by shifting from peak summer months to September or October, she wrote, citing Hopper data.\n\nwatch now\n\nOf course, it may be difficult for certain travelers to be flexible. Parents may be tied to summer trips due to school vacation schedules, while workers in certain roles, say, teachers or tax preparers, may be limited in when they can take time off work. Additionally, tours or cruises generally come with rigid start and end dates, and it may not make financial sense to tack on additional days — and extra hotel and food costs — at the beginning or end of a trip, French said.\n\nOther airfare hacks\n\nD3sign | Moment | Getty Images\n\nThere are other ways to save, though, experts said. Layovers, while potentially burdensome, are often a surefire way to save money. Booking an itinerary with a layover saves travelers about 22%, on average, versus flying nonstop, according to Google Flights. Just remember to pack all the essential items for your trip in your carry-on baggage in case your suitcase doesn't make it onto the next airplane, French said.",

      "title": "Are popular lip oils safe to use? They can be if you focus on ingredients 'rather than brand names,' doctor says",
      "description": "A popular lip oil is trending on TikTok for potential links to negative skin reactions. Here are some likely causes, and what to look for in a lip oil.",
      "content": "In recent years, lip oils have become more popular among beauty consumers. Similar to lip gloss, the oils give the lips a glossy appearance, but they also double as skincare products that are designed to keep lips hydrated. \"When they're doing the right thing, lip oils promote shine and hydration, and they can even promote plumping of the lips as well,\" says Dr. Rebecca Small, clinical professor at University of California, San Francisco. But ingredients matter, Small says. \"Patients do sometimes report increased pigmentation on their lips as a result of using these products.\" A popular lip oil began trending on TikTok with photos of women showing their lips before and after using the product consistently. The social media users, mainly women of color, experienced intense hyperpigmentation that they allege is as a result of adding the lip oil to their skincare routine. Here's why certain lip oils may be causing hyperpigmentation, and what to consider when choosing a lip oil product.\n\n'You will magnify UV exposure with a lip oil' if it doesn't have SPF in it\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy of lips is an important first step to getting a clear picture of why certain lip oils may cause hyperpigmentation, Small says. The skin on the lips is much thinner than the skin on your face, which makes it more susceptible to dehydration and sun damage, she explains. \"It does not have the same type of UV defense that the rest of our skin has, and it's prone to cancers [and] hyperpigmentation.\" A skin condition that people may be experiencing is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which is when inflammation of the skin leads to increased production of melanin and the darkening of certain areas on the body, Small says. \"If you are using a product that, for example, doesn't have UV protection, you will magnify UV exposure with a lip oil. So if it doesn't have SPF in it, you're more prone to PIH,\" she says. \"And if there are ingredients in the product that are like plumping ingredients, sometimes those plumping ingredients can be irritants.\" Another possibility is that people are developing dermatitis, which is very common after using products that have fragrances in them. \"Dermatitis that's irritant related or allergy related causes your lips or other areas of your body to be red, scaly [and] uncomfortable,\" Small says. It's important to see a medical professional if your lips are in pain, swelling excessively, extremely red or much darker than usual, cracked or bleeding, she notes. And you should immediately stop using any product that you think are causing these symptoms.\n\nWhat to consider when choosing a lip oil",

But what I’ve come to learn is that the cuisine of Greece is much more regional than the handful of dishes often associated with the Greek islands. I’ve just returned from my second trip to Crete, which is renowned for its intricate craft culture and rich cuisine.\n\nLike much of the southern Mediterranean, Cretan cooking is about simple technique and high-quality local produce. Mountain herbs and greens, bulbs, honey, goat, goat’s cheese and fish are abundant over and around the island. Then, of course, there’s the olive oil, known around the world for its exceptional quality. Cretan friends have told me that most people don’t buy commercial olive oil. Families have olive trees and harvest the fruit, which is sent to a communal press to be turned into oil.\n\nThe author’s Cretan dinner at Ammos © Douglas Martin Eveleigh\n\nWhen visiting Crete, I stay at Ammos, a small seaside hotel in the north-west of the island. The hotel has been run by Nikos Tsepetis for the past 30 years. Ammos has a bit of a cult following. During my time there, I spoke to several families who have been coming every summer for 13 years. It’s difficult to put a finger on exactly what makes it so special. I think it has to do with the way a place can make you feel. I always say that most people go to restaurants in the hope they’ll be made to feel good. Sure, the food plays a part. But more than anything, we all want to feel comfortable, taken care of (but not bothered)… When it comes to a hotel, this desire is compounded by a million.\n\nGuests dig in to the food © Douglas Martin Eveleigh Evridiki prepares the kserotigana, fried ribbons of dough soaked in honey © Douglas Martin Eveleigh\n\nCretan cooking is about simple technique and high-quality local produce\n\nAt Ammos, Nikos acts more like an orchestra conductor than a hotelier. His staff have worked in the hotel season after season. One of the longest-serving staff members, Edi, has been there for 28 years and has done every job. On my most recent stay, he rocked my two-year-old son to sleep in his pram as we had dinner. Nikos doesn’t use any reservations platforms, so anyone that stays at Ammos must book directly through him. He plays a bit of chess when booking guests. He thinks about which guests will get along with others, and tries to encourage people to book at certain times in order to ensure harmony. I left the hotel with a couple of new friends who I look forward to meeting again next year. I can’t help but think he had a hand in this matchmaking.\n\nGohar with hotel owner and co-host Nikos Tsepetis © Douglas Martin Eveleigh\n\nOn my last night at the hotel, Nikos and I hosted a Cretan meal on the roof and invited several guests from town to join. A woman named Evridiki came from a village nearby to cook a typical Cretan meal, which is usually reserved for weddings. She invited me into the kitchen to show me how to make these recipes. She slaughtered two chickens and a goat the night before and we prepared a gamopilafo, a rice dish made of chicken and goat stock. We cooked the rice with sheep butter and served it with lots of lemon. Nikos employs only women in the kitchen, and I had a great afternoon. There is an immediate intimacy one finds when cooking with others that’s difficult to come by any other way. Immediately we were exchanging stories of growing up, of our mothers and families.\n\nSneaking a bite to Tsepetis’s dog Johnny at the table © Douglas Martin Eveleigh\n\nWe drank Lefkos, a local white wine made from Vidiano grapes by a young vintner named Iliana Malihin. Dessert was kserotigana, fried ribbons of dough soaked in honey. Traditionally they are placed on the table first, before the meal, then removed to make way for the pilaf before being brought back at the end. Evridiki showed me how to roll out the dough using a pasta sheeter, and then quickly drop the sheets into the sizzling oil while twirling to create a flower-like shape. I’ve seen versions of this all over the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Nikos explained that this meal is symbolic of celebrations, and is considered an offering from one family to another. This brought me back to thinking about what makes one feel at home in a hotel. The most fitting answer seems to be a generosity of spirit.\n\n@lailacooks",

      "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer why his company is investing $2.5 billion to manufacture glass in Corning 's Kentucky factory, praising the company's technology.\n\n\"This is the place to put it,\" Cook said of his investment in Corning. \"I feel very confident in that, because when you look at innovation, when you look at the cost, when you look at the quality, these are all things that are factor into our decisions — this is a great place.\"\n\nApple announced the lofty investment last month and said all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be manufactured in Corning's facility. Corning has had a relationship with Apple for years — the manufacturer's glass has been used in iPhones since its first iteration in 2007.\n\nCook pointed in particular to the strength of Corning's \"ceramic shield\" technology, which he said is thin and light, but also durable.\n\nAccording to Corning CEO Wendell Weeks, the new version of the ceramic shield is 50% stronger than the first version. Weeks also spoke with Cramer and Cook on Friday, and he said Apple's investment would boost the factory's workforce by 50%.\n\n\"This is going to become the world-leading manufacturing site for production of highly-specialized glass,\" Weeks said. \"We're going to triple production.\"\n\nTo Cook, domestic manufacturing can help create \"a hub of economic activity in different places,\" saying that factories themselves create jobs but also bolster local businesses. Weeks agreed and suggested Corning views its business as a \"social contract\" with the community. He spoke about the Kentucky plant's evolution in innovating glass since it opened in 1952.\n\n\"When you walk around the factory, you'll meet people who, they're third generation Corning employees in this factory,\" Weeks said. \"But what the people today are doing has nothing to do with what their grandfather did.\"",

      "title": "Can an Amazon AI voice guide you better than customer product reviews? It's starting to try",
      "description": "Amazon shoppers can easily go down the rabbit hole of customer product reviews. Can an AI audio summary replace them all?",
      "content": "Anyone who has ever gone in search of a product review on Amazon knows how valuable the experience of other shoppers can be, and how easy it is to fall down the rabbit hole of customer comments, from five-star raves to one-star takedowns — sometimes hundreds of words to get to the point. As Amazon continues to roll out AI features it says will make shopping easier, AI-generated audio descriptions of products are in the mix and scraping that customer commentary — maybe ultimately settling into a position to replace it as a go-to source of buying information.\n\nCalled \"Hear the Highlights,\" the AI-voiced product descriptions rely on a large language model to script the summary based on a variety of sources, pulling from Amazon's product catalog, customer reviews, and information from across the web, and then translating the content into short-form audio clips. The summaries began rolling out during the summer on select products to a subset of U.S. customers and have now reached all U.S. customers as a button in the mobile shopping app, scaling up to cover over one million products.\n\nA unique appeal of Amazon, and other e-commerce options, has always been the ability to get information from actual users, not just product descriptions. Of course, bogus reviews have long been a problem for Amazon, even though it bans use of paid promotion and other inauthentic forms of review writing. You still have to sort through various efforts to game the system, and in recent years, signs that the newest review writers are chatbots like ChatGPT. But actual people sharing their actual, idiosyncratic experience with a product — customers as a source of information, and informed decision making — have been a key part of the learning process from clothing and shoe sizes to safety and more narrow questions: When purchasing a new toaster, does it do bagels, is the timer setting accurate, how easy is it to clean the crumb tray?\n\nCan AI improve on that? Reviews are by nature unwieldy in the mass individuality, but human readers have proven pretty adept at distilling what they need from the human chaos. In some sense, the brain of the average Amazon review reader is a pretty good large language model, skimming and picking out key words and key information, so an AI will have to do it at least as well as a human would if it's to add to the customer experience as promised.\n\nAI and cognitive overload\n\nAI does have its advantages. For one, it won't experience cognitive overload when facing an electric tea kettle on Amazon with over 32,000 reviews. It can comb through the data, but can it gives us only what we need or want to know? That can still be tricky for AI to get right, and it may be inherently problematic to mix product catalogs, customer reviews, and web information into a single distillation – with the sources of this information each coming with its own set of intentions.\n\n\"It's important to recognize where AI is currently strong, such as in automation and pattern recognition, and where it still falls short, like in judgment-heavy tasks,\" said Ankur Edkie, CEO & co-founder, Murf AI, which creates AI voiceovers. \"A key question is whether there's a way to factor in customer context as an input while generating these summaries,\" he said.\n\nThe value of AI, according to Edkie, is finding the proper problem-capability fit. If that isn't achieved, the sense of gimmickry is likely to sneak in through a door left open for AI fatigue, which he says consumers are likely experiencing by now.\n\nAmazon's Hear the Highlights AI-audio summaries are currently the same for every user.\n\n\"The AI summary needs to capture nuance and context. For example, even a few negative reviews on safety can outweigh many positives on other features,\" Edkie said, adding that if a customer is focused solely on product performance, then summaries that emphasize price might not be relevant.\n\nThe ability to factor in context, and to make the review process more of a dialogue between consumer and machine is likely where the technology is headed – in other words, toward the agentic side of AI, where Amazon is also actively adding to its AI commerce tools, such as Rufus, and a shopping tool called Interests AI, which prompts users to describe an interest \"using your own words,\" and then it generates a curated selection of products. That feature, rolled out in the spring, is separate from the main search bar on Amazon's website.\n\nChat and audio summaries will remain among the ways to engage, but having real-time conversations with an AI voice agent — asking specific questions, clarifying concerns, and getting deeper insights from reviews — is what will shift the experience from one-way delivery to two-way discovery, making it far more personalized, according to Edkie. \"Currently, you can interact with Rufus through text or by using voice input, but Rufus cannot talk back, its responses are text-only,\" he said. \"With voice agents, however, you can have a two-way conversation with a bot that speaks to you,\" he added.",

Nic Coury | AFP | Getty Images\n\nFor decades, shows like \"Star Trek\" and novels like \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" have showcased fictional universal translators, capable of seamlessly converting any language into English and vice versa. Now, those gadgets once limited to works of science fiction are inching close to reality. During its iPhone unveiling event on Tuesday, Apple included a video of many travelers' dream scenario. It showed an English-speaking tourist buying flowers in an unnamed Spanish-speaking country. The florist addressed the tourist in Spanish, but what the tourist heard was in clear, coherent English. \"Today all the red carnations are 50% off,\" the tourist heard in English in her headphones, at essentially the same time that the clerk was speaking. The video was marketing material for Apple's latest AirPods Pro 3, but the feature is one of many of its kind coming from tech companies that also include Google parent Alphabet and Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.\n\nApple introduces live translation to airpods. Courtesy: Apple\n\nTechnological advancements spurred by the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 have ushered in an era of generative artificial intelligence. Almost three years later, those advancements are resulting in real-time language translators. For Apple, Live Translation is a key selling point for the AirPods Pro 3, which the company unveiled on Tuesday. The new $250 earbuds go on sale next week, and with Live Translation, users will be able to immediately hear French, German, Portuguese and Spanish translated to English. Live Translation will also arrive as an update to AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 on Monday. And when two people are speaking to each other wearing AirPods, the conversation can be translated both ways simultaneously inside each user's headphones. In Apple's video demo, it looked like two people talking to each other in different languages. Analysts are excited that the feature could mark a step forward for Apple's AI strategy. The translation feature needs to be paired with a new-enough iPhone to run Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI software suite. \"If we can actually use the AirPods for live translations, that's a feature that would actually get people to upgrade,\" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told CNBC on Wednesday. Translation is emerging as a key battleground in the technology industry as AI gets good enough to translate languages as quickly as people speak. But Apple is not alone.\n\nHost Jimmy Fallon holds Pixel 10 Pro Fold mobile phone during the 'Made by Google' event, organised to introduce the latest additions to Google's Pixel portfolio of devices, in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., August 20, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nA crowded market\n\nIn the past year, Google and Meta have also released hardware products featuring real-time translation capabilities. Google's Pixel 10 phone has a capability that can translate what a speaker is saying to the listener's language during phone calls. That feature, called Voice Translate is designed to also preserve the speaker's voice inflections. Voice Translate will start showing up on people's phones through a software update on Monday. In Google's live demo in August, Voice Translate was able to translate a sentence from entertainer Jimmy Fallon into Spanish, and it actually sounded like the comedian. Apple's feature does not try to imitate the user's voice. Meanwhile, Meta in May announced that its Ray-Ban Meta glasses would be able to translate what a person is saying in another language using the device's speakers, and the other party in the conversations would be able to see translated responses transcribed on the user's phone. Meta will hold its own product keynote on Wednesday, where the company is expected to announce the next generation of its smart glasses, which will feature a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC reported in August. It's unclear if Meta will announce more translation features.\n\nMeta employee Sara Nicholson poses with the Ray-Ban sunglasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 24, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo | Reuters\n\nAnd OpenAI in June showcased an intelligent voice assistant mode for ChatGPT that has fluid translation built in as one of many features. ChatGPT is integrated with Apple's Siri, but not in voice mode. OpenAI is planning to release new hardware products with Apple's former design guru Jony Ive in the coming years. The rise of live translation could also reshape entire industries. Translators and interpreters are the No. 1 type of job threatened by AI, and 98% of translators' work activities overlap with what AI can do, a Microsoft Research study published in August found.\n\nPurpose-built translators\n\nIn the past several years, a number of purpose-built translation gadgets have entered the market, taking advantage of global high-speed cellular service and improving online translation services to produce puck-like devices or headphones with translation built-in for a couple hundred dollars. \"What I love about what Apple is doing is it really just illuminates the fact that how pressing of an issue this is,\" said Joe Miller, U.S. general manager of Japan-based Pocketalk, which makes a $249 translation device that goes between two people conversing in different languages and translates their conversation in audio and text. Given that Apple shipped about 18 million sets of wireless headphones in the first quarter alone, according to Canalys, the company's entry into the market will expose a wider subset of customers to improvements translation tech has made in recent years. Despite Apple's entry into the market, makers of purpose-built devices say their focus on accuracy and knowledge of linguistics will provide better translations than what's available for free with a new phone. \"We actually hired linguists,\" said Aleksander Alski, head of U.S. and Canada for Poland-based Vasco Electronics, which released translation headphones called E1 in January, and is planning a forthcoming model that can imitate the user's voice, like Google's feature. \"We combined the AI with with human input, and thanks to that, we were able to secure much higher accuracy throughout all the languages we offer.\" There's also home-field advantage. Vasco Electronics' largest market is Europe, and Apple's Live Translation isn't available for EU users, Apple said on its website. Some of the products being introduced by tech companies are less than universal, and are limited to a small number of languages for now. Apple's feature is only available in five languages, versus Pocketalk's 95. Pocketalk's Miller believes that the potential of the technology goes far beyond a tourist ordering a glass of wine in France. He says that it's most powerful when its used in workplaces like schools and hospitals, which require privacy and security features that go beyond what Apple and Google provide. \"This isn't about luxury tourism and travel,\" Miller said. \"This is about the intersection of language and friction, when a discussion needs to be had.\" Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.",

CNBC\n\n(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday in your inbox.) UnitedHealth Group shares have soared almost 30% since Berkshire Hathaway's disclosure in mid-August that it had purchased a bit more than 5 million shares between April 1 and June 30. Minutes before that SEC filing, UNH closed at $271.49. On Friday, it ended trading at $352.51. Although UNH had already started to bounce from its lowest close of the year of $237.77 on Aug. 1, Berkshire's endorsement of the troubled stock is responsible for at least a sizable chunk of its recent gains.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nIt is not clear, however, whether Berkshire's investment is profitable (on paper) at this point. The current price is up just 13.0% since its $311.97 close at the end of Q2 on June 30. We don't know exactly when Berkshire did its buying during the second quarter, so we can only look at a range of possible purchase prices. (And, of course, it may have continued to buy in the third quarter. We won't know about that until mid-November.)\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nAt Q2's high of $606.36 per share, Berkshire would have paid $3.1 billion for its stake, putting it 42% into the red. At the low of $248.88, the 5 million shares would have cost less than $1.3 billion, giving it a 42% gain. Using the average close for the period, the price comes in at $1.9 billion. Today's value of $1.8 billion is around 8% below that level. Since Berkshire's buying was presumably triggered by the price slide early in the quarter, the actual purchase price is probably at the lower end of the range, but there still appears to be a significant chance the stake is the red, despite the stock's recent gains.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on April 21, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBerkshire & Co., however, are usually in it for the long haul, and there are some bullish signs for the stock, which is still down 30% year to date. After meeting with UNH's management, analysts at Morgan Stanley said, \"We are incrementally positive following discussions with UNH [management] where it had conviction in the turnaround.\" On Friday, Morgan Stanley's Erin Wright raised her price target to $395 from $325. And on Tuesday's \"Lightning Round,\" CNBC's Jim Cramer said he doesn't like to buy stocks that are under investigation, but \"there are some people who seem to know that the worst is over.\"\n\nKraft Heinz slips as Berkshire overhang looms\n\nThe outlook for a larger Berkshire stake, however, isn't as good. Kraft Heinz shares fell another 4.25% this week after dropping more than 2% last week in the wake of its plan to split back into two companies, essentially reversing the 2015 merger that Warren Buffett helped organize.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nIn an unusual move for the normally passive investor, Buffett told CNBC he's \"disappointed\" the company went ahead with those plans, even though it knew he, representing KHC's largest shareholder, opposed a split. CNBC.com's Yun Li quotes Gordon Haskett's Don Bilson as saying, \"Beyond any worries that investors might have with the plan itself, they must also grapple with the possibility that Buffett will now dump his stock.\" Because its stake is more than 10%, any sales would have to be reported publicly within two business days.\n\nBuffett drops four notches on new Forbes 400 ranking\n\nWarren Buffett is #9 on the just-released 2025 Forbes 400 list of the richest people in the United States. That's down from #5 last year even through his estimated net worth remained unchanged at $150 billion.\n\nWarren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.

Late Tuesday, Wall Street first fixated on Oracle's astonishing fiscal 2026 first quarter report . Management shared that the company's remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, skyrocketed 359% from the year prior. Oracle stock closed at a record high Wednesday, jumping nearly 36% in the session that followed the release. Shares lost steam on Thursday and Friday, but still managed a weekly gain of 25.5%. The release raised more than just Oracle's stock price. Shares of chipmakers like Club holdings Nvidia and Broadcom jumped in tandem as the software vendor's huge cloud backlog signaled continued demand for AI infrastructure. Nvidia and Broadcom shares rose 4% and 10%, respectively, on Wednesday, and nearly 6.5% and almost 7.4% for the week. Economic data was also a big focus for investors this week. On Wednesday, investors grew more confident of an interest rate cut after the producer price index (PPI), a key wholesale inflation measure, fell more than expected in August. PPI, which tracks input costs across an array of goods and services, declined 0.1% last month. That's compared to a Dow Jones estimate of a 0.3% increase. As a result, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq finished Wednesday's session at records. Thursday complicated matters for policymakers, however, after prices for consumers accelerated more than expected in August. The consumer price index (CPI), a widely followed gauge of retail inflation, recorded a seasonally adjusted 0.4% increase for the month. That's the biggest CPI gain since January and surpassed Dow Jones estimates of a 0.3% rise. During that same session, weekly jobless claims came in at their highest level in almost four years. This showed signs of further softness in the U.S. labor market and potential cracks in the country's economy, leaving the door open for the Fed to lower rates more aggressively into the end of the year. Despite the murky readings, the jobs report seemed to overshadow CPI as traders priced in a great probability of a reduction for the first time since December 2024. .SPX .IXIC YTD mountain S & P 500 (SPX), Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) year-to-date performances The Club capitalized on the market's moves with five trades since Monday. The Club bought Boeing twice this week. On Monday, we initiated a position in the aerospace giant after last month's exit of Coterra Energy left us with an opening in the portfolio. The Club bought more Boeing on Friday as shares continued to decline. When starting a new position, we recommend that each additional purchase be at a lower price point than the previous one. That will help reduce the overall weighted average cost basis. The Club invested in Boeing, in part, because the Trump administration's trade policies and subsequent tariff deals should strengthen demand for jets. The Club set a price target of $275 apiece on the stock, representing 27 % upside from Friday's close. On Tuesday, we trimmed some of our Goldman Sachs position into strength as shares reached record highs. The sale, however, does not reflect any change in the Club's thesis. We used the cash proceeds to purchase more Texas Roadhouse . Shares of the steakhouse chain have declined significantly since its earnings report in early August – a reaction we view as overdone. Shares saw weekly gains of nearly 5.7%. The Club bought more Honeywell shares Thursday in hopes that the Fed's expected cuts will translate into a pickup in the economy, which would lead to more manufacturing and demand for the industrial conglomerate's offerings. Plus, it's a good time to buy as Honeywell stock has lagged compared to its peers in the runup to its split into three publicly traded companies. Some on Wall Street call this \"spin purgatory ,\" and it often has little to do with underlying fundamentals. The stock lost more than 1% for the week. WFC GEV YTD mountain Wells Fargo (WFC), GE Vernova (GEV) year-to-date performances Additionally, we took note of commentary from top executives at two of our portfolio companies: Wells Fargo and GE Vernova . On Tuesday, Wells Fargo CFO Mike Santomassimo shared positive mid-quarter updates that included a big increase in share repurchases. Wells has bought $5.5 billion of its stock quarter to date, according to the executive, more than the firm's purchased in other quarter this entire year. To us, that's a sign that management's upbeat on both the firm's capital levels and its earnings outlook. Santomassimo also added that Wells is seeing \"really good green shoots\" this quarter now that its $1.95 trillion asset cap has been removed and the bank goes on the offense. The CFO pointed to more revenue growth, for example, in its asset and wealth management businesses. \"We started to change the company and really pivoted towards the businesses that we think have the best opportunity over the long run,\" Santomassimo said at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference. Shares, however, closed slightly lower Tuesday. This was likely due to profit-taking after Monday's run and not with company fundamentals. For the week, Wells stock gained more than 3%. After that, GE Vernova stock sank 1.5% Thursday following CEO Scott Strazik's mixed remarks at the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference. Strazik said that onshore wind orders, which is a part of GE Vernova's smallest business segment, remain soft and projected a decline in revenues in 2026 compared to 2025. This isn't entirely unexpected, given the Trump administration's critical stance on wind energy. Still, the CEO did seem upbeat on the demand for power – which is great news for a company that makes turbines used in the generate electricity. \"Not only is the world going to need more energy, but the proportion of that energy that's going to be coming from electrical power is going to grow.\" Shares of the industrial name ended the week 7.4%% higher. AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Club holding Apple on Tuesday showcased its refreshed iPhone 17 lineup and other devices at the company's annual hardware event. Shares fell 1.5% that session as some investors viewed the product updates – like longer battery life and better camera technology – as more evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Many wanted more material announcements regarding the company's artificial intelligence suite, Apple Intelligence. The stock lost 2.3% for the week. Jim disagreed with the lackluster reception to the latest iPhone lineup. \"Wall Street's got it wrong. There are a lot of amazing things in this one versus this one,\" Jim said Friday, also pointing to the new iPhone Air and some price increases. That being said, Apple's generative AI rollout is still crucial to the company's future success. \"Ultimately, Apple still needs to deliver on its Apple Intelligence offering if we are going to see any dramatic acceleration in the upgrade cycle for its most important product: the iPhone,\" Zev Fima, a portfolio analyst for the Investing Club, wrote in an analysis of the event. \"The good news is that Tuesday's updates certainly keep the Apple product line fresh and attractive, providing the time needed to nail down that AI strategy.\" (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

      "description": "For Panama Canal, drought is an economic and existential risk. New dam and land bridge projects will help trade move, but won't be ready before next El Niño.",
      "content": "After a historic drought that paralyzed vessel transits through the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Authority is moving ahead with major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate future droughts and the risk of low water levels that in recent years plagued the key global trade gateway.\n\nThe Panama Canal depends on fresh water for its operations and is rainfall dependent.\n\n\"We use about two and a half times the amount of water a city of the size of New York uses for the canal operation,\" Ricaurte Vásquez, Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC.\n\nIn a good year of rain, that means over 50 vessel transits through the canal's locks a day, but in recent years, weather has not cooperated. Severe drought conditions hit the region from late 2022 to 2024, forcing the canal to reduce transits and put in place vessel weight restrictions in an effort to conserve water.\n\nThe canal is critical to the U.S. economy and trade. The U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal, with total U.S. commodity export and import containers representing about 73% of Panama Canal traffic, and 40% of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year. In all, roughly $270 billion in cargo is handled annually.\n\nIn April, Canal administration began the pre-qualification and selection process for concessionaires to build a land bridge, including what it describes as a flagship natural gas pipeline line to move natural gas liquids (NGLs) without relying on the canal itself. A road connecting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as port terminals built on either coast, would also be constructed, with the terminals also able to accommodate containers and roll-on and roll-off cargo.\n\nThe pipeline would allow for the transport of liquified petroleum gas, ethane, butane, and propane from the Atlantic side to a Pacific-side terminal, where another vessel would be loaded and carry the product to Asia. Canal officials hope this will attract more LNG transits through the canal.\n\nThe Panama Canal Authority reported a 29% drop in vessel transits during fiscal year 2024, with the biggest hits in LNG and dry bulk transits. LNG transits were down 66 percent, while dry bulk transits were down 107 percent.\n\nEven though water levels are back to regular operating conditions, LNG traffic has not returned to pre-drought transit activity, with carriers continuing to choose the longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, according to S&P Global data.\n\nVasquez tells CNBC that U.S. energy companies are \"drooling at the possibilities\" of this alternative way to move the commodity. Transit time-wise, Vasquez said the pipeline would be competitive versus traversing the canal, and reliability would be higher because it is now water-dependent. \"This is important because with many of these products, reliability and delivering on time are critical,\" he said.\n\n\"We decided to do a land bridge to complement the waterway,\" Vásquez said. \"We are aware that these are high-value products that have a destination in Asia,\" he said, noting the project was announced in Tokyo, which is the largest buyer of these energy products.",

      "title": "$7 trillion 'wall of cash' worry is looming for investors once Fed interest rate cuts start",
      "description": "Trillions of dollars are parked in money market funds due to years of high rates, but with the Fed poised to cut, portfolio moves will need to be made.",
      "content": "watch now\n\nThis may not be an era in which Americans are awash in physical currency fattening their wallets, but we are awash in cash parked inside accounts that have been generating attractive yields thanks to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to combat inflation. There is a record amount of cash in money market funds, roughly $7.6 trillion, according to Crane Data. But as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut rates for the first time in a year, maybe by as much as 50 basis points — a policy shift that will, over time, reduce the yields on risk-free cash-equivalent investments — market attention has shifted to whether that cash will be on the move. At the most extreme, Wall Street's so-called \"wall of cash\" theory — which claims that all that cash on the move can create its own stock market rally — has been debunked about as many times as it has been offered. At the very least, it is a significant moment of change in Federal Reserve rate policy. The latest jobs market data confirmed mounting fears of a labor market heading in the wrong direction and the need for the central bank to move sooner rather than later before unemployment spikes. Meanwhile, the latest inflation data, while far from an all-clear on pricing pressures throughout the economy, did not suggest the Fed will hold off on at least a 25 basis point rate cut next week. The payrolls data \"cinches the case for a rate cut,\" said Investment Company Institute Chief Economist and lead ETF researcher Shelly Antoniewicz earlier this week on CNBC's \"ETF Edge.\" In line with most market experts and economists, she said the pace of those cuts will remain data-dependent as the Fed watches both the labor market and inflation, and manages its dual mandate of full employment and price stability. But she added on the podcast portion of ETF Edge that as the Fed starts to lower rates, the roughly $7 trillion \"sitting in money market funds\" will gradually flow into more risk-on assets, including stocks and bonds, as savings rates become less attractive. To be sure, more mutual fund companies are going to be chasing those assets on the precipice of a huge decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission which could allow every asset management company to offer an ETF share class of their funds. Antoniewicz noted that there are 70 applications in with the SEC for exemptive relief and the ICI, the main mutual fund industry trade group, is working with hundreds of fund sponsors to be prepared to add an ETF share class if the SEC says \"go.\" While all that may be true, Peter Crane, president and publisher of money fund research firm Crane Data, has heard it all before, at least when it comes to the Fed and money market funds, and he has a simple response: money fund assets just keep growing, and the only times in recent history when they've gone down as opposed to up is when rates are literally at zero during periods of economic calamity.\n\n\"The rates matter but much less than most people believe,\" Crane said. In fact, in the 52-year history of money market funds, assets have only gone down after the dotcom bust and financial crisis, periods where intense economic stress led to rock-bottom rates, a \"bottom of the rate cycle nailed to zero,\" he said. If things get bad enough in the economy that the Fed has to cut more aggressively sooner rather than later, that's not exactly a sign of a market where investors are likely to be overly aggressive with their own risk profile, either. \"Dream on Wall Street,\" Crane said. \"It makes for a good talking point, but the $7 trillion is not going anywhere but up.\" There has also been a shift over time in the usage of money market funds, with what was once mostly a retail investor phenomenon now majority institutional and corporate cash — roughly 60% of the market, according to Crane's data. \"They are not moving, no matter what,\" he said. \"They are not going into the stock market.\" It's not that money fund researchers like Crane deny that lower rates matter, or that some of the money fund assets may indeed move to higher-risk, higher return areas of the market — he thinks that is maybe 10% of the $7 trillion-plus, though he adds there is no precise data to rely on for such an estimate. But when you consider the roughly $20 trillion that Americans leave in bank deposits, basically giving their money to Wall Street to go off and make more money on while earning no money themselves, a 25 basis point cut in the current interest rate environment does not exactly make money funds a dead option. \"It's more about how big is the rate differentially,\" he said. \"A quarter-point to cash investors, looking several years back to when rates were zero and they were used to getting nothing?\" he asked. While investors may get \"re-sensitized\" to yield, at what level will that occur? Currently, money fund investors are earning on average 4.3% annually.\n\nCrane says even if rates move down to 3%, by no means assured since 100 basis points of Fed rate cuts is seen by many as aggressive barring a major downturn in the economy, much of the money will stay put, especially when you consider what banks are paying to hold cash, maybe at best 0.5%. \"Bank deposits wildly underpay,\" he said. That's why Crane believes it will take a repeat of Fed history for a significant amount of that cash to move. \"Likely, if you go to zero there will be erosion in the base,\" he said. The Fed did cut rates a year ago, before it paused due to fears about inflation, and money funds assets have only gone higher since. \"If we go to 3.80%, 3.85%, is anyone going to care?\" Crane said. Additionally, even though the overall balance in the money fund market is huge, individual balances tend to be relatively small. If an investor has $5,000 in a money market fund and it is earning 1% or 2% more or less, Crane says there are better things to think about as far as making money. \"You just spent more money thinking about the problem then you are earning. Nothing is worth doing for less than 1% or one hundred bucks,\" he added. And, at a time when the bond market has been volatile, there is more danger in fixed-income and in the treasuries market than investors had come to expect, making duration a more dicey proposition for investors. Portfolio options as the Fed shifts to lower rates One thing is certain: the money fund market won't move next week in the immediate aftermath of a Fed decision to cut rates. Unlike treasury bills, money funds have a weighted maturity of 30 days, therefore assuming the Fed cuts next Wednesday at its FOMC meeting, treasuries start to go lower but money funds take a month to move fully lower because they are still owners of higher-yielding. older securities. And at least in the short-term, if the Fed unveils a jumbo cut, Crane would expect money market assets to go up for the same comparative reason. \"But over the long term, it is a negative,\" he said. \"Eventually, less interest is being generated compared to other investments.\" But the fact that the market keeps hitting record highs and money fund assets are also hitting record highs doesn't suggest the game is one where whatever benefits stocks hurts money markets.\n\nwatch now",

      "title": "From bananas to toys, these 5 charts show how much costs have risen since Trump's tariffs went into effect",
      "description": "Since Trump’s tariffs took effect in April, inflation has been showing up in categories that rarely see big swings.",
      "content": "Inflation has picked up since President Donald Trump announced new import tariffs in April, with the latest consumer price index data showing outsized increases in tariff-sensitive categories, including coffee, toys and televisions. Overall prices rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.7% in June and July, according to CPI data released Thursday. The CPI measures the cost of a broad basket of everyday goods and services, including groceries, rent and medical care.\n\nThat leaves inflation drifting farther from the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4% in August, the biggest monthly gain since January, and is up 3.1% from a year earlier. Taken together, this means more pressure on everyday household spending.\n\nHow tariffs feed into inflation\n\nAlthough Trump's sweeping tariffs were first announced in April, the effects have shown up unevenly since goods move through supply chains at different rates and imports make up a larger share for some products than others. Even so, they still have a \"significant impact on prices,\" according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Take bananas, for example. Prices climbed 4.9% from April through August — equivalent to an annualized pace of about 15% — a notable jump for a category that rarely sees much inflation. Virtually all U.S. supply comes from Central and South America and is now subject to a 10% tariff. Bananas aren't the only industry affected. The Fed's Beige Book survey in August said all regions were seeing tariff-related price increases, spanning sectors from food and retail to manufacturing and health care, with many businesses reporting they've started to pass those costs on to consumers. Overall, Americans now face an average tariff rate of 17.4% — the highest since 1935 — an increase estimated to cost households an extra $2,300 in 2025, according to the Yale Budget Lab. (These estimates include tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which remain in place while the court challenge is pending). To get a sense of where else inflation has been heading, here's a look at five of the most-impacted products since April, compared with their historical norms for the same time period over the last 10 years.\n\nCoffee\n\nCoffee prices jumped 9.8% from April to August, including a 3.6% spike last month. Poor harvests earlier this year had already tightened supply, but prices rose dramatically faster after new import tariffs took effect. Since the U.S. grows less than 1% of the coffee it consumes, the market is especially exposed to import duties. Global tariffs that started at 10% in April were later raised sharply on major suppliers like Vietnam and Indonesia. Brazil — which supplies more than a third of the U.S.'s arabica beans — was hit with a 50% duty on Aug. 6. That late move could keep coffee prices climbing in the months ahead, industry groups say.\n\nJewelry and watches\n\nJewelry and watch prices surged 5.5% in August, far above their historical average monthly gain of 0.8%. The U.S. relies heavily on imports for luxury jewelry and its components, and since April a 10% tariff has been broadly applied to this category. But rates have gone higher still. On Aug. 7, the U.S. raised tariffs on all Swiss imports — including watches — to 39%, far above the baseline. Switzerland supplies more than 90% of the U.S.'s imported precious-metal wristwatches, per the Wall Street Journal. The U.S. has also extended tariffs to India, a leading supplier of cut and synthetic diamonds, and to Japan, which exports premium mechanical watches to the U.S. Those additional levies could push jewelry and watch prices higher in the coming months.\n\nBananas\n\nNormally a stable category in the CPI, bananas saw an unusually sharp 4.9% increase between April and August. With virtually all supply imported from Central and South America, the U.S. market is directly exposed to tariffs, including the 10% across-the-board duty imposed in April. Bananas remain cheap compared with most fruits and vegetables, with a reputation for long-running price stability. Reflective of that stability, Trader Joe's held its banana price at 19 cents each for more than two decades, only raising it to 23 cents in early 2024.\n\nTelevisions\n\nTelevision prices edged up 2.5% in August and are up 3.1% since April. While the increase might seem modest, television prices have been on a downward trajectory since the late 1990s. Manufacturing efficiencies and the rise of \"smart\" TVs that generate revenue from advertising and data collection have helped drive sticker prices lower. Nearly all TVs sold in the U.S. are imported, mainly from Mexico, China and Vietnam. Imports from Mexico can face tariffs of up to 25%, depending on compliance with USMCA rules, while some shipments from China face rates as high as 30% and Vietnamese TVs generally face a 20% duty. The summer run up in prices stands out as a break from the usual pattern for a product that typically gets cheaper over time.\n\nToys",

      "title": "Convenience stores are eating fast-food chains' breakfast",
      "description": "Fast-food chains are losing breakfast customers. Convenience stores are partially to blame.",
      "content": "In this article MCD\n\nCASY Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Wawa store is seen on May 29, 2024 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura | Getty Images\n\nFast-food restaurants are losing breakfast customers to convenience stores. Morning meal traffic to fast-food chains rose 1% in the three months ended in July, while visits to food-forward convenience stores climbed 9% in the same period, according to market research firm Circana. \"Over the long run, convenience stores have taken share, really at foodservice overall, but the morning meal has been their strong suit,\" David Portalatin, Circana senior vice president and foodservice industry advisor, told CNBC, noting the trend has largely been driven by what the group calls \"food-forward convenience stores.\" For decades, McDonald's and its rivals have tried to lure consumers away from home to eat their early morning offerings, betting that convenience and unique items will win over diners. While fast-food chains have made some inroads, 87% of what consumers eat and drink in the morning comes from their own refrigerators or pantries, according to Portalatin. That leaves plenty of opportunity for fast-food chains — and anyone else who wants a slice of the breakfast pie.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A McDonald's Corp. McGriddle breakfast sandwich is displayed for a photograph in New York, U.S. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBefore the pandemic, fast-food chains started seeing a new rival for their breakfast customers: convenience stores. Regional chains like Wawa in the Northeast and Casey's General Store in the Midwest were expanding their reach and investing in their foodservice options, taking pages from the fast-food companies' own playbooks. For a time, lockdowns and the shift to hybrid work reversed those market share gains. But in the three months ended in July, food-forward convenience stores once again gained the upper hand in the battle to serve consumers breakfast, according to Portalatin. Circana separates food-forward convenience stores like Buc-ee's and Sheetz from the broader industry, although more chains may soon fit under that umbrella. 7-Eleven, the biggest convenience, or c-store, in the U.S., is planning to invest more in its prepared foods business, inspired by the success of its Japanese business. C-store chain RaceTrac on Wednesday announced that it's buying Potbelly for about $566 million, although it's unclear what its plans for the sandwich chain include beyond expanding its footprint.\n\nFast-food's breakfast breakdown\n\nIn recent years, more diners have been watching their budgets, conscious of rising menu prices and a tight job market. Year-over-year morning traffic to fast-food chains has fallen every quarter for the last three years, according to data from Revenue Management Solutions, which advises restaurants on how to increase sales and profits. In the second quarter, fast-food breakfast visits fell 8.7%. To see the struggles, look no further than McDonald's, which dominates the quick-service breakfast category. \"... The breakfast daypart is the most economically sensitive daypart, because it's the easiest daypart of a stressed consumer to either skip breakfast or choose to eat breakfast at home,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call in late July. \"And we, as well as the rest of the industry, are seeing that the breakfast daypart is absolutely the weakest daypart in the day.\" McDonald's morning visits accounted for 33.5% of its traffic in the first half of 2019 but fell to 29.9% in the first half of 2025, according to Placer.ai data. To try to drum up traffic, the chain has included breakfast items in its new Extra Value Meals, including a deal for a Sausage McMuffin with Egg with a hash brown and a small coffee for $5. To reverse breakfast's slide, fast-food chains are taking hints from their competition. After years of convenience stores looking to fast-food chains for ideas on how to grow prepared food sales, from installing ordering kiosks to new menu items, the dynamic has flipped. \"[Quick-service restaurants] are looking at late-night sales and early morning sales, and they are directly looking at convenience stores and saying, 'What is working? How can we bring that to our stores?'\" National Association of Convenience Stores spokesperson Jeff Lenard told CNBC.\n\nThe rise of the c-store meal\n\nwatch now\n\nPrepared foods have offered a lifeline for convenience stores as demand for gasoline, tobacco and lottery tickets has fallen over time. The industry's overall foodservice sales reached $121 billion in 2024, according to data from the NACS. Most customers visit the gas pump during the morning and evening rush hours, on their way to and from work, presenting the perfect opportunity for c-stores to sell them breakfast or dinner. This year, 72% of consumers surveyed by InTouch Insight said they saw c-stores as a real alternative to fast-food chains, up from 56% a year ago and 45% two years ago. Broadly, the c-stores that have focused on fresh food have been winning over more customers. For example, Wawa has seen its customer base grow by 11.5% since 2022, while fast-food chains McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's have seen their combined customer base shrink 3.5% in the same time, according to data from Indagari, a transaction data analytics firm. The majority of 1,170 respondents to an InTouch Insight survey for CNBC said that they have purchased made-to-order breakfast from a c-store in the morning in the past three months. Forty-eight percent of respondents said that when they choose breakfast from a convenience store, they are replacing a visit that they might otherwise make to a fast-food restaurant like McDonald's or Dunkin'. Buying coffee and breakfast from a c-store likely won't be cheaper than making it at home. But consumers perceive it as \"good bang for their buck,\" according to Sarah Beckett, vice president of sales and marketing for InTouch Insight. Plus, c-store customers get a wider breadth of options. In addition to coffee, gas stations sell energy drinks, protein shakes and yogurt smoothies. And customers can pick up a granola bar or banana to accompany their breakfast sandwich. Fast-food chains lack that kind of variety. But above all, what matters to consumers is the food itself. \"While [a] convenience store broadly does have some tailwind from being a lower price point, the ultimate differentiator, and what's really going to set apart the winners from losers, is that quality aspect of it,\" Circana's Portalatin said.\n\nSignage at a Casey’s General Store.

      "content": "Well, I was wrong, and I did manage to make it to one last day at the Toronto International Film Festival. One of the movies I wanted to see the most this year was Scarlet, the latest from Mamoru Hosoda, whose most recent film was the metaverse fairy tale Belle. Whereas that film was a reimagining of Beauty and the Beast, Scarlet is a twist on Hamlet that’s full of bold, creative ideas. I mostly enjoyed it, but unfortunately it’s saddled with an ending that doesn’t really fit.\n\nI also managed to squeeze in two other films: a Korean revenge / heist thriller, and a Norwegian film about connecting through art. You can read my thoughts on all three below.\n\nThat’s a lot to squeeze into one festival, and I appreciate everyone who followed along. Now I’m gonna take a nap.\n\nProject Y\n\nEven though the opening makes it clear everything turns out relatively OK, Project Y remains riveting and unpredictable throughout. It starts out as a heist movie. Two best friends (Han So-hee and Jun Jong-seo) have worked hard for years and are about to retire from their awful jobs for good, but then they run into a sequence of scams that completely wipe out their savings. So when they hear about a hidden cache of cash, they can’t resist. They get caught, of course, and the film shifts into revenge mode. There are a few implausible moments along the way, but Project Y has an unrelenting kind of tension that’s strengthened by an absolutely vicious villain (Kim Sung-cheol). Just be warned: there are some very gruesome torture sequences.\n\nNo word yet on a wider theatrical release.\n\nScarlet\n\nScarlet (Mana Ashida) is a young princess in 16th century Denmark who finds her life turned upside down when her uncle kills her father to take the crown for himself. The set-up is basically Hamlet, but the twist is that much of the film takes place in the afterlife. It’s a space known as the “otherworld” — neither heaven nor hell, but instead a wasteland where people struggle to get by, and a massive, ancient dragon prowls the skies smiting people with bolts of lightning. The fantasy element of the film is strong, as is Scarlet’s single-minded quest for revenge. But the film unravels towards the end, with a happy ending that feels very out of place.\n\nIn theaters in Japan on November 21st; no word yet on a global theatrical release.\n\nSentimental Value\n\nSisters Nora (Renate Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas) try to come to grips with a troubled childhood after their mostly absentee father Gustav (Stellan Skarsgard) reenters their lives following their mother’s death. It’s an understated but powerful film from Worst Person in the World director Joachim Trier, and it happens in part through understanding trauma through art, as Gustav is a legendary film director attempting to make his most personal movie yet. Sentimental Value is filled with gut punch moments like when Nora asks her sibling “why didn’t our childhood ruin you?” But it brings it all together in a way that feels genuinely hopeful and touching.\n\nIn theaters on November 7th.",

      "content": "This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on phones and other tech outside the US, follow Dominic Preston. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.\n\nHow it started\n\nSmartphone batteries are bigger than ever, while the phones themselves are shrinking. But whether you’re seeing the benefit — thin phones with big batteries — depends on where you live.\n\nThe key is the introduction of silicon-carbon batteries, which make it possible to fit more battery capacity into the same size cell, as in phones like the Honor Power, whose 8,000mAh battery delivers more power than some iPads. The flip side of that is putting the same capacity into much smaller cells, seen in the likes of the Oppo Find N5, a foldable phone that’s as extraordinarily thin as Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 but has a 5,600mAh battery that wouldn’t be out of place in an Ultra-sized flagship.\n\nHonor and Oppo aren’t the only companies on board. Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo, OnePlus, Nothing, and more have all released phones using silicon-carbon batteries. It’s not just phones, either; Whoop wearables have used silicon-carbon batteries since 2021 thanks to a partnership with Sila Nanotechnologies, and EV manufacturers from General Motors to Porsche have invested heavily in the technology.\n\nBut you’ve probably noticed some pretty big names missing from that list — none of Apple, Samsung, and Google, the three major players in the US phone market, have embraced the new batteries yet. That’s despite the fact that between Samsung and Google’s foldable phones, and super-slim models like the newly announced iPhone Air, the possible applications are immediately obvious.\n\nHow it’s going\n\n“Silcon-carbon batteries” is arguably a bit of a misnomer, because these don’t replace lithium batteries — they’re a subset of them. In the broadest strokes, the bulk of a battery is made up of two parts, the cathode and the anode, and it’s the movement of ions between the two that either charges or discharges the cell.\n\nIn most modern batteries, the cathode is lithium-based, while the anode uses graphite. It’s that bit that silicon-carbon batteries change, using a blend of silicon and graphite for the anode. Silicon has almost 10 times the energy density of graphite, so just a little goes a long way — Honor’s recent Magic V5 foldable is the first to replace 15 percent of the graphite with silicon, and other phones have used as little as 5 percent.\n\nMore silicon means better battery capacity in the same space, so the race is on to push those numbers up. The reason manufacturers can’t go all in and swap all the graphite for silicon is that its energy density comes with one big downside: longevity.\n\nWhen graphite anodes absorb lithium ions during charging, they expand just a little. When silicon anodes absorb those same ions, they expand quite a lot more. Over time, those repeated expansions and contractions damage the battery’s structure, contributing to the decline in battery life you’ll be familiar with if you’ve ever hung onto the same phone for more than a few years. That anode expansion isn’t the same as the swelling that causes batteries to burst out of phones’ bodies, but is one of a few factors that can contribute to it. Simply put: silicon anodes allow for batteries that are much denser, but don’t last as long. And we don’t have a lot of real-world evidence for how bad this problem really is, since the first phone with a silicon-carbon battery, the Honor Magic 5 Pro, only launched in 2023.\n\nThat might be one reason why we haven’t seen Apple, Samsung, and Google jump on board. All three make long-term product support one of their selling points, so switching to batteries that might die off early wouldn’t be a great look. Then there are EU regulations, which now require smartphone batteries to retain 80 percent of their capacity after 800 charging cycles. Silicon battery manufacturer Group14 says its batteries meet that threshold, but it’s still an area where tech giants are likely to be cautious.\n\nThere are also question marks around how big they want their batteries to get anyway. International shipping regulations add stringent requirements — and “dangerous goods” labels — for battery cells larger than 20Wh, which at a standard voltage of 3.7W equates to around 5,400mAh. Batteries bigger than that cost more to ship, especially by air, which is a good incentive to stay just below that line. Even the larger Chinese OEMs are limited by this — the Nothing Phone 3 includes a huge 5,500mAh battery if you buy it in India, but the European version has a 5,150mAh cell instead — below the line where shipping charges go up. This is just one of countless examples of a regional split in battery sizes, with OnePlus even admitting to Android Authority that rules around shipping were to blame for its Nord CE4 Lite bringing a smaller battery to Europe.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWith silicon-carbon batteries first introduced into phones two years ago, we’re reaching the point where manufacturers can get a sense of the real-world longevity of the power cells. If there are problems, they might rein themselves in a little, but if not you should expect things to get more extreme from here.\n\nExpect silicon percentages to push up, next to 20 percent and then beyond, until whenever the diminishing returns kick in. That will mean bigger and bigger batteries in “regular” phones — Oppo has confirmed that its next flagship, the Find X9 Pro, will offer a 7,500mAh battery in China, and it’s been rumored that the Honor Power 2 will go even further, with a battery as big as 10,000mAh, twice the size of some power banks. At the other end of the spectrum, dupes of the iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge are surely on the way, and will no doubt tout bigger batteries than either while staying just as thin.\n\nThe real question is if, and when, Apple, Google, and Samsung will jump on board. While one strand of silicon-carbon battery development is pushing for higher proportions of silicon, others are experimenting with ways to reduce the downsides. I expect this is what these three have their eye on, waiting to be sure that the compromises are minimal, just as they have with their slow adoption of faster charging speeds. Expect Samsung in particular to be cautious — it’s spent the last nine years fearing a repeat of its exploding Note 7 debacle, and is in no rush to risk one, telling T3 that while it’s researching silicon batteries, it places “a little more priority on the reliability.”\n\nBy the way\n\nDon’t mistake silicon-carbon for silicon carbide, a compound material that’s also popping up in tech right now, everywhere from EV semiconductors to the lenses in Meta’s AR glasses\n\nYes, we’ve been getting phones with comically large batteries in them for years, but they used to look like bricks . Imagine the capacity Energizer could put in a novelty phone now!\n\nIf the aim is thinner phones, silicon-carbon will only get us so far — the latest foldable phones are already as thin as the USB-C port, so that’s got to go if we want to really push the limits.\n\nRead this",

      "content": "is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.\n\nI would not call the time I’m having with Hollow Knight: Silksong “fun,” and yet I’m still playing.\n\nIn the depths of The Marrow, the second major area of Silksong, there’s a particularly nasty midboss. I eventually beat him, but my reward wasn’t a new ability, item, or a bench where I could rest and save my progress. All I got was pain, suffering, and death. In Silksong, the only way out is through, but the “through” is a tunnel lined with spikes that occasionally spew gouts of flame.\n\nI should have given up right then and there, but I have not abandoned Silksong the same way I do other unfun games. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t just put Silksong down and chalk it up as another “not for me” game the way Hollow Knight just wasn’t for me. I enjoy Metroidvanias a great deal — Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was one of my favorite games of last year. And for Silksong, I wanted to try Team Cherry’s work again and see if it would finally click. It has, and it’s because of the community (and a lot of spite).\n\nI came to Hollow Knight late, long after the buzz about it had left my social media circle. With Silksong, I’m playing it at the same time as everyone else. My social media feed is full of people who love the game much more than I do, posting tips, commiserating about its moments of bullshit (hello, lantern fruit pogo platforming), and gushing over the adorable Sherma.\n\n“I have only known Sherma for a day and a half…”\n\nWhen I post lamenting the game’s bullshit, I get excited messages from my friends giving me advice on what I should do next. It’s like we’re all doing our own personal let’s plays together while being in each other’s chats. It feels good. I am not alone in my misery, and better yet, I’ve got friends to help. For Silksong it’s worked in such a way that’s kept me playing longer than I would have if I were going this alone.\n\nThis kind of collective, collaborative gaming experience has also taught me a new trick: taking a break. I’ve never been the kind of gamer that stops playing when I can’t overcome an obstacle. I either do something else in the game or keep running at my problem until I figure it out. Now, when I feel myself getting even the slightest bit mad because I was so close (or I thought I was so close) to surmounting a challenge, I turn off the game and come back later. It’s so silly that, once again, the “touch grass” people are right, but the strategy has gotten me through some of the game’s most egregious moments. (If the vendor Shakra wants to leave her post in Greymoor because of something I did, that’s fine. But taking her bench with her that’s in a room right before a brutal combat gauntlet is a unique and dastardly flavor of Silksong bullshit.)\n\nYou see this fight? Bullshit. Image: Team Cherry\n\nAnd when I overcome that bullshit, I get this incredible frisson of thrill. When I easily beat a boss in fewer tries than I’m used to, I feel godly. I’m actually quite tickled to hear Team Cherry is working to nerf some of the early bosses, because those were fine. (It’s the damn pogo platforming!)\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m going to finish Silksong and whatever I feel at the end of that journey will be more like relief than joy. Silksong has shown me I don’t need to feel “happiness” or “joy” to continue playing a game. I just want to feel something — even if that something is pure spite.",

And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)\n\nThe Drop\n\nScreen share\n\nYou could probably ascribe a large part of my personality to a specific era of the website Lifehacker. Back in the day, it was this breezy, fun, curious, and self-aware blog about how to use technology and explore the internet and just be a person in the future. And for a long time, it was all coming out of the brain of Gina Trapani, one of the internet’s great bloggers.\n\nGina’s been up to lots of stuff in recent years, but now she’s blogging again! Her site, Note to Self, was an instant subscribe for me — and if you like Installer, then I suspect you’ll like it, too. When I saw the site launch, I reached out to Gina to see how a true lifehacker does a homescreen in 2025.\n\nHere’s Gina’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: Right now, I’ve got a four-year-old iPhone 13 Pro, which means I’m looking forward to upgrading this year. Once you get three to four years of mileage out of your phone, when you do finally trade up, the latest model feels absolutely heavenly, and I appreciate it more.\n\nThe wallpaper: This is Apple’s 2025 Pride wallpaper, which I grabbed in June and haven’t updated since. I like what Apple did with the Pride designs this year — they managed to make something fresh but recognizable.\n\nThe apps: Camera, Settings.\n\nPeople who know me from Lifehacker will expect me to have a tricked-out setup with all the hot new apps, and I’m here to disappoint. I’ve been in touch-grass mode for a while; I want my preteen to see more of me than the top of my head while I look down at my phone. So my homescreen is minimal and utilitarian.\n\nI’ve turned off almost all those horrendous red badges; I feel conflicted about using AI instead of my brain. I keep a small number of my most frequently used apps on my homescreen, and almost all of them are grouped into purpose-related folders, like Communication, Health & Fitness, Travel. That adds another tap to get to them, but the extra step helps me be intentional about what I set out to do. For everything else, I pull down the search bar to find it.\n\nI’m a big note-taker, and I use Obsidian, so I have an iOS shortcut called “Note.” It’s a direct link to an Obsidian note called “Inbox,” where I capture stuff to process later.\n\nIn Health & Fitness, I’ve got a triathlon training app I vibe-coded on Lovable, driven by a personal Google Sheet. All it does is tell me one thing: whether I’m supposed to run, bike, or swim at the gym that day.\n\nAs it turns out, I’m nearly five decades old and need a teeth-brushing coach. The Oral-B app paired with my electric toothbrush gamifies things, which works for me. It helps me get pressure and coverage right, and my full two minutes of brushing in because I won’t otherwise.\n\nSuperhuman is better than Gmail. Todoist is for deadlines. Citymapper is my favorite way to navigate New York City. Monarch is my where-does-the-money-go app. Checking ebooks out of the library with Libby brings me much joy.\n\nI also asked Gina to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email [email protected] or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For more great recommendations, check out this post on Threads, this post on Bluesky, and this post on The Verge.\n\n“I ‘inherited’ my daughter’s Nintendo Switch and got Demon Slayer: The Hinomaki Chronicles on sale for $20. Getting myself hyped up for the movie this weekend.” – Michael\n\n“Stephen Robles on YouTube has created an amazing iOS shortcut that can help protect your iPhone if it’s ever stolen. It sends you the location of your device along with photos from both the front and back cameras. It even plays an audible alert that says, ‘This iPhone is stolen!’ Best of all, you can activate it from any phone, whether Android or iOS.” — Owen\n\n“I just started Frieren and man, the hype is warranted. I’m more of a rom-com, slice of life guy rather than fantasy, but the story is super compelling so far.” — Ryan\n\n“I have been thoroughly enjoying Bill McKibben’s Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization. Its thesis — that the astoundingly rapid buildout of solar and wind could provide us a lifeline out of the worst effects of climate change, if we act now — has brought more hope and enthusiasm about the future than I’ve felt in what feels like years.” — Hoto\n\n“Currently checking out the beta of 2XKO, a free 2v2 tag-team fighting game set in the League of Legends universe. Appears to be great for newcomers.” — Daniel\n\n“I’m cautiously enjoying a new feature on the Garmin Forerunner 955. A recent software update ties in my travel plans to the watch, and I get recommendations for time zone adjustments. It gave decent suggestions when I went from the US to Italy, back to the US, then to France all within a week. The gentle reminders of when to stop caffeine were the best.” — Sean\n\n“I binged and loved Long Story Short by the creator(s) of BoJack Horseman.” — Tal\n\n“1001 Albums Generator recommends a new album every day (including weekends if you like) from the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It’s a great way to listen to some of the best-regarded music and expand your listening habits beyond your music recommendation algorithm.” — Richard\n\n“Alien: Earth. Let’s talk about the octopus eye.” — Sheila\n\nSigning off\n\nOkay, so there is one show I watched this summer that I want to talk about, just for a second. It’s a Netflix show called Building the Band, and it is essentially American Idol meets Love is Blind meets The Circle. The premise makes no sense! It also totally works. I found myself shockingly invested in all these singers and bands, and the whole thing is structured so that none of the 10 episodes ever feel repetitive or draggy. I would watch a thousand seasons of this show — and knowing Netflix, I assume that’s exactly what we’re going to get. And not to brag, but I called the winner with about four episodes to spare.\n\nSee you next week!",

      "content": "In Brief\n\nWith Tesla shareholders set to vote on a proposed 10-year, $1 trillion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk in November, board chair Robyn Denholm spoke to The New York Times to defend what would be the largest pay package in corporate history.\n\nDenholm, who was also on the special committee that put the compensation proposal together, argued that Musk needs to be motivated by extraordinary challenges tied to extraordinary compensation. At the same time, she suggested he’s less interested in the additional wealth that the promised Tesla shares would represent, and more in the voting power.\n\n“I think it’s a little bit weird talking about the dollars when it’s actually the voting influence,” said Denholm, whom The Times described as “occasionally appearing ill at ease” during the interview.\n\nIt might also seem counterintuitive to offer such a massive pay package when Tesla’s profits and vehicle sales are falling, but Denholm insisted that the plan is about “future performance.”\n\n“It’s not about past performance,” she said. “He gets nothing if he doesn’t perform against the goals.”\n\nAs TechCrunch previously noted, the package’s goals are considerably less ambitious than some of the promises Musk has made about Tesla in the past.",

      "description": "Rainmaker wants to use flares to seed clouds — the airline pilots' union says it won't be safe.",
      "content": "Rainmaker Technology’s bid to deploy cloud-seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union, which has urged the Federal Aviation Administration to consider denying the startup’s request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines.\n\nThe FAA’s decision will signal how the regulator views weather modification by unmanned aerial systems going forward. Rainmaker’s bet on small drones hangs in the balance.\n\nThe Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) told the FAA that Rainmaker’s petition “fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety” and poses “an extreme safety risk.”\n\nHowever, Rainmaker CEO Augustus Doricko said an email that all of the union’s objections are based on only the public notice, rather than non-public documents submitted to the FAA that outline all of the company’s safety data and risk mitigations.\n\nRainmaker is seeking an exemption from rules that bar small drones from carrying hazardous materials. The startup filed in July, and the FAA has yet to rule. Instead, it issued a follow-up request for information, pressing for specifics on operations and safety.\n\nIn its filing, Rainmaker proposed using two flare types, one “burn-in-place” and the other ejectable, on its Elijah quadcopter, to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation. Elijah has a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet MSL (measured from sea level), which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly. Drones need permission from Air Traffic Control to fly inside this bubble.\n\nRainmaker’s petition says it will operate in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace unless otherwise authorized. ALPA notes the filing doesn’t clearly state where flights would occur or what altitudes would be used. However, Doricko said the documents submitted to the FAA disclosed that in addition to the flights being constrained to a max altitude of 15,000 feet MSL, they will be conducted in airspace that is predetermined to be safe by aviation authorities, “voiding any reasonable concern about high altitude flight or airspace coordination.” ALPA did not reply to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe union also objects to the flares themselves, citing concerns about foreign object debris and fire safety. ALPA points out that the petition does not include trajectory modeling of the ejectable casings or analysis on the environmental impacts of chemical agents.\n\n“Regarding their objection to the use of flares, independent bodies like this administration’s EPA and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding,” Doricko said.\n\nSam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager, said the company respects the pilot’s union and hopes to “continue to strengthen our relationship with the organization,” but claimed the objection “shows a lack of understanding of why Rainmaker has filed for this exemption.”\n\n“Our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations,” Kim added.\n\nDoricko said that a typical Rainmaker operation disperses 50-100 grams of silver iodide, and far less than that in a flight with flares, while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics, sulfur oxides, and soot – significantly more material than a Rainmaker op.\n\n“Rainmaker is interested in doing the best, responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide. ALPA’s objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our CONOP, all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non-public docs that the FAA is reviewing now,” Doricko said.\n\n“Regarding ALPA’s concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace, our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals, intentional coordination with local ATC, certified pilots, and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers,” he said.\n\nHowever, Rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords “with whom Rainmaker has developed close working relationships.”\n\nCloud-seeding already happens today, largely in the western U.S., with crewed airplanes flown in coordination with state agencies. Ski resorts commission the operations to help keep their runs white, and irrigation and water districts fly them to build snowpack in the winter to help feed their reservoirs during the spring melt.\n\nThe general practice of cloud seeding dates back to the 1950s. By spraying small particles into certain clouds, scientists found they could induce precipitation. Typically, cloud-seeding operations use silver iodide for the particles, mostly because they mimic the shape of ice crystals.\n\nWhen a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super-cooled, they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point. Once the ice crystal forms, it can grow quickly if conditions are right, faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances. Plus, the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet, which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation.\n\nRainmaker’s twist — doing this work with drones instead of pilots — could prove safer in the longer term. The company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded, overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews, over rural areas, with other safety checks in place.\n\nWhat happens next hinges on whether the FAA thinks those mitigations are sufficient. However it’s decided, the agency’s response will likely set the tone for novel cloud-seeding approaches.\n\n9/13/2025: The story has been updated to include Rainmaker’s comments from Augustus Doricko, founder and CEO, and Sam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager.",

      "content": "Few video game adaptations understand their source material quite like the Exit 8 film. It takes the rules and structure of the game — which strands players inside of a looping hallway in a Tokyo subway station — and then builds on them with actual characters and a story. And according to director Genki Kawamura, one of the reasons that the movie feels so fresh could be because of how he approached it. “I wasn’t necessarily thinking about a film adaptation of a video game,” he tells The Verge. “I was thinking about how to create a new cinematic experience that blurs the lines between video game and cinema.”\n\nThe two are very similar, and the film even starts out with the game’s first-person perspective. And like the game, the movie features a person stranded inside of a hallway that repeats itself, and the only way to get out is to spot “anomalies” — basically, weird shit that changes in each loop — and then switch directions. Kawamura says that he discovered the game because he plays a lot of indie titles, and he was immediately attracted by just how much like Tokyo the space felt. But he also realized the premise could make for a much more universal story. “I felt like a lot of people who live in cities have had that experience of getting lost in a passage like that,” he explains. “I felt like combining the Tokyo design and the very universal experience could create something cinematic.”\n\nBut turning the game, which has no characters or story and lasts less than an hour, into a movie required adding a lot of elements. The main character, known only as the Lost Man (Kazunari Ninomiya) is struggling with both keeping a job and the potential of becoming a father when he encounters the strange, looping hallway. While there, we meet other characters, including the Walking Man (Yamato Kochi), who starts out as a source of terror, along with a young woman (Nana Komatsu) and small boy (Naru Asanuma), who are similarly trapped. There are also new anomalies that weren’t in the game, and Kawamura says the idea was to create unsettling moments that related to the outside world. For Ninomiya’s character, for instance, this means some pretty creepy baby-related sound design.\n\nImage: Neon\n\nOne of the most interesting things about the film is how each character approaches the rules of the hallway, which require carefully inspecting the surroundings before deciding whether to walk forward or backward. Some take their time, some rush, and they all look at things in a different order. It’s a bit like watching different people play the game — which was exactly the intention.\n\nKawamura says he had a discussion with Shigeru Miyamoto, in which the famed Super Mario and Legend of Zelda creator told him “a good video game is fun to play but it’s also fun to watch somebody play.” So some of the inspiration for the characters came from places like YouTube, where the creative team watched playthroughs of the game to see how players approach and react to things. “Everyone is playing by the same rules and in the same space, but each player makes different mistakes, and they have different reactions to each failure,” Kawamura says. “And I thought that because of that, the personality of the individual player comes to the surface.”\n\nIf you have played the game, watching Exit 8 is a surreal experience. It takes place in a space you already understand intimately, and then twists it in new and uncomfortable ways. Kawamura had a similar experience on the set itself. The hallway was built on a sound stage and consisted of two corridors — nicknamed Hitchcock and Kubrick — connected by a small pathway dubbed Mizoguchi. Kawamura says this structure allowed the team to create long, continuous shots that made it seem like the hallway was looping. The idea was to confuse viewers — though the filmmakers weren’t immune.\n\n“It was a good tool to disorient the audience,” he explains. “Even we got confused about where we were on set during the shoot.”\n\nExit 8 is expected to hit theaters in early 2026.",

      "content": "If you listen to music the way a lot of people do these days — with a pair of wireless earbuds, from a Bluetooth speaker, or just blaring directly out of your phone — you will never notice a difference between Spotify’s high-quality 320Kbps streams and its lossless audio. But, if you usually listen with wired headphones while working at your desk, or have a quality speaker from the likes of Bose that supports Spotify Connect, there actually is something to be gained here.\n\nComparing Spotify’s normal quality streams (96Kbps) with the new 24-bit / 44.1kHz lossless FLAC files feels unfair. Even a relatively untrained ear should be able to hear the difference. While compression technology has improved a lot since the days of crunchy Napster MP3s, there is still a noticeable loss in quality at 96Kbps. High frequencies especially can seem muddy and distorted.\n\nEven just jumping from normal quality to high quality (320Kbps) results in a very noticeable difference. But going beyond that to lossless, or even hi-res lossless on a competing service like Tidal, yields diminishing returns. I’d venture to guess that most people will be unable to tell the difference between Spotify’s high-quality streams and lossless under a lot of circumstances. If you’re listening to a hip-hop song that samples crackly vinyl, a metal record with heavily distorted guitars, or a dance single with a kick drum that’s been compressed into oblivion, it can be hard to pick out the differences. It’s not that they’re not there — Kendrick Lamar’s vocals cut through the mix more on “squabble up,” and Sudan Archives’ heavily processed violin on “DEAD” feels more lively — but they can be easily lost in the bombast.\n\nWhere lossless can make a big difference compared to Spotify’s standard high-quality setting is with gentler styles of music that feature a lot of acoustic instruments and vocals. My go-to throughout testing (because it was one of the only albums I could find that was available in lossless on Spotify and hi-res lossless on both Apple and Tidal) was Nina Simone’s Pastel Blues.\n\nThe differences between lossless and high quality are subtle, to be sure. Unless you’re actively listening for it, you might not notice the slightly different texture to the background noise on “Strange Fruit” or the ever-so-slightly sharper sound of the high-hats on “Sinnerman.” And when older recordings clip, the resulting distortion sounds less harsh in lossless.\n\nTo see these relatively minor benefits requires some effort on your part, though. First thing to note is that you cannot stream Spotify Lossless through the web player; you will need to download the desktop or mobile app. The other thing to remember is that Bluetooth generally does not support lossless audio because of its limited bandwidth. Even Spotify warns in its announcement post that “Bluetooth doesn’t provide enough bandwidth to transmit lossless audio, so the signal has to be compressed before being sent.” (Let’s not get distracted by discussion of codecs like LDAC and aptX HD that lack widespread support.)\n\nIf you want to hear the difference, you’ll need to put your AirPods down and go get a decent set of wired headphones. I do recommend headphones. While you can hear the difference on a good set of speakers, it’s easier to pick out the nuances in headphones without minimal background noise. You’ll need to enable lossless on each of your devices individually; it’s not a setting that will sync.\n\nHow to enable lossless audio. Image: Spotify\n\nSpotify has caught some flack, however, for capping its lossless support at 24-bit / 44.1kHz, when Tidal, Apple Music, and Qobuz all offer 24-bit / 192kHz hi-res FLAC support. But, at the risk of upsetting the audiophiles in the audience, you’re not missing out. While I won’t pretend there’s no difference between lossless and hi-res lossless, the improvements are extremely subtle, and not worth the hassle. For one, playing back audio at 192kHz requires additional hardware in the form of an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC), or a select few Tidal Connect-enabled speakers. A DAC can run you anywhere from $50 for a cheap off-brand dongle for your phone to upward of $15,000 for the absolute lunatics out there.\n\nI tested Spotify Lossless, as well as Apple Music and Tidal’s lossless and hi-res lossless, using my MacBook Air connected to a fourth-gen Focusrite Scarlett 18i20. I listened to a variety of styles of music using my PreSonus Eris E5 studio monitors, a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones, and TMA-2 Studio Wireless+ headphones from AIAIAI. I spent a lot of time making sure I could play back 192kHz audio, and volume matching the various services only to walk away wondering if I was imagining the differences.\n\nDoing a side-by-side, I felt like the hi-res lossless “Strange Fruit” on Apple Music was ever-so-slightly clearer than the standard lossless version on Spotify. But I also felt like the standard lossless Apple FLAC was slightly less noisy than the Spotify FLAC. So it’s possible that Apple’s encodings are just higher-quality in general. I’m inclined to believe that because I honestly could not tell the difference between Apple’s regular lossless and hi-res lossless versions when played back to back.\n\nBandwidth also becomes a major issue when playing hi-res lossless files. Unless you’re downloading them for playback offline, just don’t bother. Apple Music frequently choked when trying to skip around a hi-res track and would often pause briefly after playing the first two seconds of a song.\n\nHere’s the thing: Most of us tend to do a lot of our listening on Bluetooth headphones. And those don’t support lossless audio. If you have good wired headphones or a decent pair of speakers, Spotify’s lossless can make a subtle but noticeable improvement to your listening experience. Just don’t be jealous of those other services with “hi-res” audio.",

      "description": "Imagine if George Cukor's The Women was a modern, Spanish-language telenovela set in Ecuador rather than a 1939 dramedy about the lives of wealthy Manhattanites. Now imagine if the series was directed by Pedro Almod&#243;var and its characters were brought to life with stop-motion animation instead of being portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights like Joan Crawford [&#8230;]",
      "content": "is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\n\nImagine if George Cukor’s The Women was a modern, Spanish-language telenovela set in Ecuador rather than a 1939 dramedy about the lives of wealthy Manhattanites. Now imagine if the series was directed by Pedro Almodóvar and its characters were brought to life with stop-motion animation instead of being portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights like Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer. Now, think about how transgressive that show would be if it treated queerness as the norm and told a politically charged story about the relationship between colonialism and capitalism. That show would be a lot like Adult Swim’s Women Wearing Shoulder Pads.\n\nWhen I recently sat down with Women Wearing Shoulder Pads creator Gonzalo Cordova and Cinema Fantasma cofounders Arturo and Roy Ambriz, they told me that they see Women Wearing Shoulder Pads as an opportunity to explore Latin American identity in all of its complexity. For all of its silliness, they wanted the show to feel like a thoughtful depiction of what life in South America can feel like. And to do that, they knew it was important for Women Wearing Shoulder Pads to unfold almost completely in Spanish — a first for Adult Swim.\n\n“There would have been a little bit of a phoniness to telling this story in English,” Cordova explained. “It would have felt like a capitulation to the larger forces of marketability, and my job as an artist is to do everything I can to fight against those forces. It’s the studio’s job to push back against me, and that push-pull dynamic can be what makes things interesting.”\n\nWomen Wearing Shoulder Pads tells the tale of Marioneta Negocios (Pepa Pallarés), a ruthless entrepreneur from Spain who has built a dazzling life for herself in Quito, Ecuador’s capital. Most everyone living in Quito thinks of cuyes (the Ecuadorian Spanish word for guinea pigs) as a traditional delicacy that is part of their culture, but Marioneta sees the furry rodents as pets. Marioneta knows that tanking the cuyes’ marketability as foodstuffs would be a huge blow against her longtime rival, cuy meat magnate Doña Quispe (Laura Torres). And even though Marioneta’s plan would harm the livelihood of her on-again / off-again lover Espada (Kerygma Flores) — a woman who fights cuyes like a bullfighter in massive stadiums — it’s all worth it in the Spaniard’s eyes because she prioritizes her own desires above anyone else’s.\n\nThere’s a pointed absurdity to each of the episodes that makes it feel like a classic Adult Swim series. Characters frequently burst into song, Nina gallavants around Quito riding a giant cuy like a horse, and many of the show’s close-up shots are actually cutaways to living actors. But there is also a cinematic extravagance and cultural specificity to Women Wearing Shoulder Pads that sets it apart from Adult Swim’s previous stop-motion projects.\n\nCordova’s insistence that Women Wearing Shoulder Pads needed to be as authentically Latin American as it is ridiculous was part of what excited the Ambriz brothers. The duo — whose work typically skews more supernatural — knew that animating a more grounded series would present a unique set of challenges. But Cordova’s vision for a story that did not frame being from Latin America as an inherently negative thing spoke to both of them deeply. “We are all so used to seeing Hispanic people represented through the eyes of people who don’t live in Latin America, and oftentimes there are nuances that just aren’t depicted the way they should be,” Roy told me.\n\nAs a lifelong lover of Almodóvar’s films, Cordova always wanted Women Wearing Shoulder Pads to feel like a heightened tribute to the Volver director’s signature storytelling style. Cordova told me that, while Women Wearing Shoulder Pads isn’t trying to be an Almodóvar parody, it is a comedy, which required him to “exaggerate every element of the story just a little bit to see what happens.” That approach to crafting humor is one of main reasons why the series is so keenly focused on the lives of female characters, and why all of their romantic relationships are explicitly queer.\n\n“With Almodóvar’s films, even when they’re filled with straight characters, they are still very queer stories, and it was important to me that we preserve that energy while finding a unique way to express it,” Cordova said. “You kind of forget about the male characters, and we wanted to amplify that feeling. But the second you do that within the context of a romantic melodrama, you really only have one choice left, which is to make every single character gay in some way.”\n\nTo Cordova, the real joke at the center of Women Wearing Shoulder Pads is how technically ambitious the series is. At one point, he’d considered using puppeted marionettes as opposed to stop motion. But he found that working in animation afforded him and the rest of the production team much more creative freedom.\n\n“I’ve made live-action things before where I’d dreamt of putting the camera in the ceiling and shooting the characters walking across the room that way, but this was the first time that I could actually do that kind of stuff,” Cordova said. “And with marionettes, part of the joke would have been their inability to fully express this kind of melodrama, and I think the show would have been worse for having that joke be so obvious.”\n\nThe Ambriz brothers explained to me that creating fluid, dynamic camera movements is one of the trickiest parts of the stop-motion production process. Cordova also envisioned the series putting extra emphasis on dramatic lighting and shadows, which are similarly hard to pull off well in this medium. And many of the series’ more involved sequences required the Cinema Fantasma team to craft far more individualized, handcrafted shots than normal.\n\n”From the beginning, Gonzalo was very clear that this show needed a high-concept approach to its cinematography — not just in terms of the camera’s movements, but also in the way in which he orchestrated the characters’ movements through scenes,“Arturo said. “It’s easy when things are standardized and you only have three sets, four puppets, 10 props, two camera setups, and two lighting setups, but on this show, absolutely every shot was unique.”\n\nThat dedication to craft becomes increasingly apparent as Women Wearing Shoulder Pads builds to its season 1 finale, which puts a period on one chapter of Marioneta’s life. But Cordova is open to the possibility of revisiting this world, albeit from a variety of new perspectives. The world’s only but so big, however, and certain characters could pop up again.\n\n“This show is called Women Wearing Shoulder Pads, and it is my intention for every season to really, really commit to that,” Cordova said. “There will be different women we will meet and different stories that we would tell with returning characters coming back. The intent is that it’s not quite an anthology series, but I would want to build it so every season you can kinda watch on its own and enjoy it as its own thing.”\n\nThe next episode of Women Wearing Shoulder Pads premieres this Sunday on Adult Swim, and the entire season will air as a feature-length special on HBO Max on September 29th.",

      "description": "The state's landmark safety bill sets new transparency requirements for large AI companies.",
      "content": "California’s state senate gave final approval early on Saturday morning to a major AI safety bill setting new transparency requirements on large companies.\n\nAs described by its author, state senator Scott Wiener, SB 53 “requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety protocols, creates whistleblower protections for [employees] at AI labs & creates a public cloud to expand compute access (CalCompute).”\n\nThe bill now goes to California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign or veto. He has not commented publicly on SB 53, but last year, he vetoed a more expansive safety bill also authored by Wiener, while signing narrower legislation targeting issues like deepfakes.\n\nAt the time, Newsom acknowledged the importance of “protecting the public from real threats posed by this technology,” but criticized Wiener’s previous bill for applying “stringent standards” to large models regardless of whether they were “deployed in high-risk environments, [involved] critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data.”\n\nWiener said the new bill was influenced by recommendations from a policy panel of AI experts that Newsom convened after his veto.\n\nPolitico also reports that SB 53 was recently amended so that companies developing “frontier” AI models while bringing in less than $500 million in annual revenue will only need to disclose high level safety details, while companies making more than that will need to provide more detailed reports.\n\nThe bill has been opposed by a number of Silicon Valley companies, VC firms, and lobbying groups. In a recent letter to Newsom, OpenAI did not mention SB 53 specifically but argued that to avoid “duplication and inconsistencies,” companies should be considered compliant with statewide safety rules as long as they meet federal or European standards.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "description": "Hike, which started as a WhatsApp rival before pivoting to real-money gaming, is now sunsetting after India's sweeping ban.",
      "content": "Hike, once one of India’s most valuable startups with unicorn status, has become the latest casualty of New Delhi’s recent real-money gaming ban, with the company — led by Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel founder Sunil Bharti Mittal — now shutting down.\n\nOn Saturday, Hike founder Mittal (pictured above) said that the startup’s U.S. business, which launched nine months ago, was “off to a strong start.” But he said scaling it globally would require “a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.”\n\nInitially launched as an instant messaging app rivaling WhatsApp in 2012, Hike pivoted to real-money gaming in recent years, with its primary platform, Rush, offering casual games like carrom and ludo for cash prizes, following the shutdown of Hike Messenger in 2021. Rush attracted over 10 million users and generated more than $500 million in gross revenue over its four-year run, Mittal said.\n\nStoried investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Tencent backed Hike’s early ambition to take on WhatsApp with a youth-focused messaging app. The startup was valued at $1.4 billion in 2016.\n\n“We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for?” Mittal wrote in a Substack post. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors.”\n\nLast month, the Indian government shocked the $23-billion real-money gaming industry by introducing the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, which imposed a blanket ban on such platforms. The federal government said the decision was aimed at addressing incidents of harm, including cases where individuals reportedly died by suicide after losing money in these games.\n\nIn response, top industry players including Dream Sports and Mobile Premier League (MPL) began shutting down their real-money gaming operations in India. While some started pivoting to new ventures like micro-dramas and financial services, others began exploring international markets to keep parts of their gaming businesses alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Some of them are planning to cut up to 90% of their workforce as they attempt to adapt or exit the space, sources told TechCrunch.\n\nSome VC firms backing these startups have also questioned their founders on whether there had been any early signs of regulatory action — and if so, why no steps were taken to mitigate the impact, sources familiar with the conversations told TechCrunch.\n\nEarlier this week, the Indian Supreme Court transferred all petitions challenging the new law — the rules of which are yet to be notified — from multiple state courts across the country. However, the top court has yet to begin hearing the matter.\n\n“This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger,” Mittal wrote.",

      "description": "From phone spyware and facial recognition to forensic phone hacking technology to databases and more, this tech powers Trump's deportation machine.",
      "content": "President Donald Trump made countering immigration one of his flagship issues during last year’s presidential campaign, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nIn his first eight months in office, that promise turned into around 350,000 deportations, a figure that includes deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (around 200,000), Customs and Border Protection (more than 132,000), and almost 18,000 self-deportations, according to CNN.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass deportation campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented immigrants. To aid its efforts, the ICE has at its disposal several technologies capable of identifying and surveilling individuals and communities.\n\nHere is a recap of some of the technology that ICE has in its digital arsenal.\n\nClearview AI facial recognition\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about ICE and the technology it uses?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\n\nParagon phone spyware\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, it’s unclear what’s the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Parago is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company Red Lattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nLexisNexis’ legal and public records databases\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to subscribe to the service.\n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nSurveillance giant Palantir\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with Palantir. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\n404 Media cited “a source familiar with the database,” who said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.",

      "content": "The all-electric Ram 1500 REV pickup truck is dead. Long live the extended-range Ram 1500 REV (once called the Ramcharger).\n\nStellantis, the parent company of Ram, said Friday that it will no longer develop a battery-electric full-size pickup. The company cited low demand for full-size battery-electric trucks as the primary reason, according to a statement sent to TechCrunch and posted on its website.\n\n“As demand for full-size battery-electric trucks slows in North America, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will discontinue development of a full-size BEV pickup,” the company’s statement reads. “As part of this, Ram is renaming its REEV-powered pickup to Ram 1500 REV (formerly Ramcharger). This vehicle will set a new benchmark in the half-ton segment, offering exceptional range, towing capability and payload performance.”\n\nIf the name swap is confusing, it’s because it is. But here is what’s worth knowing. Stellantis canceled plans to develop a battery electric pickup and will instead pursue an extended-range truck that gets an estimated 690 miles of range through a novel — but not unheard of — approach of combining a battery with a gas generator.\n\nThe Ram 1500 all-electric pickup was part of parent company Stellantis’ U.S. product offensive to sell more than 25 all-new BEVs by the end of the decade. But its future has been in question for months now.\n\nAfter a splashy reveal at CES 2023, and other showcases in the months that followed, Stellantis wavered on its EV truck plans. Stellantis initially said it would begin producing the vehicle in 2024. That date soon slipped to 2025.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Stellantis delayed plans to develop the broad-shouldered pickup loaded with tech, a longer cabin with third-row jump seats, and two massive and industry-busting battery pack options. At the time, Stellantis said it would push its launch into 2026.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "description": "People CEO Neil Vogel says Google's AI crawler can't be blocked because it would block the web crawler too. This lets the search giant steal its content for AI.",
      "content": "The CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. has accused Google of being a bad actor for crawling its websites to support the search giant’s AI products.\n\nNeil Vogel, CEO of People, Inc. (formerly Dotdash Meredith), a publisher that operates over 40 brands, including People, Food & Wine, Travel + Leisure, Better Homes & Gardens, Real Simple, Southern Living, Allrecipes, and others, said that Google is not playing fair because it uses the same bot to crawl websites to index them for the Google search engine as it does to support its AI features.\n\n“Google has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,” said Vogel, speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference this week.\n\nHe noted that three years ago, Google Search accounted for about 65% of the company’s traffic and that has since dropped to the “high 20s.” (Vogel shared an even more startling statistic with AdExchanger last month, saying that as of several years ago, Google’s traffic accounted for as much as 90% of People Inc.’s traffic from the open web.)\n\n“I’m not complaining. We’ve grown our audience. We’ve grown our revenue,” Vogel told conference attendees. “We’re doing great. What is not right about this is: You cannot take our content to compete with us.”\n\nVogel believes publishers need more leverage in the AI era, which is why he feels it’s necessary to block AI crawlers — automated programs that scan websites to train AI systems — as that can force them into content deals. His company, for example, has a deal with OpenAI, which Vogel described as a “good actor.”\n\nPeople Inc. has been leveraging web infrastructure company Cloudflare’s latest solution to block AI crawlers that don’t pay, prompting AI players to approach the publisher with potential content deals. While Vogel wouldn’t directly name the companies involved, he said they were “large LLM providers.” No deals have been signed yet, but Vogel said the company is “much further along” than before it adopted the crawler-blocking solution.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

So they are an intentional bad actor here,” Vogel declared.\n\nJanice Min, the editor-in-chief and CEO at newsletter provider Ankler Media, agreed, calling Big Tech companies like Google and Meta longtime “content kleptomaniacs.”\n\n“I don’t see the benefit to us in partnering with any AI company right now,” she said, adding that her company blocks AI crawlers.\n\nMeanwhile, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, whose company makes the AI-blocking solution (and who was also on the panel), said he believed that things would still change in the future when it comes to how the AI companies behave. He suspected those changes could be prompted by new regulations.\n\nThe Cloudflare exec also questioned whether fighting the AI companies using legal solutions around things like copyright law, created for the pre-AI era, was the right answer.\n\n“I think that it’s a fool’s errand to go down that path, because, in copyright law, typically, the more derivative something is, the more it’s protected under fair use … What these AI companies are doing is they’re actually creating derivatives,” Prince said. “And so if you look at the best case law that’s come out so far, it’s actually said that the use by Anthropic and others — the reason Anthropic settled recently with all the book publishers for $1.5 billion — was for them to be able to preserve the positive copyright ruling that they got.”\n\nPrince also proclaimed that “everything that’s wrong with the world today is, at some level, Google’s fault,” because the search giant had taught publishers to value traffic over original content creation, triggering publishers like BuzzFeed to write for clicks. Still, he admitted that Google was in a tough spot right now from a competitive standpoint.\n\n“Internally, they’re having massive fights about what they do, and my prediction is that, by this time next year, Google will be paying content creators for crawling their content and taking it and putting it in AI models,” he said.",

      "title": "Why the Oracle-OpenAI deal caught Wall Street by surprise",
      "description": "The $300B deal is a reminder that despite Oracle’s legacy status, it shouldn’t be overlooked when it comes to AI infrastructure. But key questions around power and how OpenAI will pay for this remain.",
      "content": "This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.\n\nOn the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it.\n\nChirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.\n\n“OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”\n\nSome industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business.\n\n“Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.\n\nPayment and power\n\nBut even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year.\n\nPower is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute.\n\nIndustry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear.\n\nDespite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday.\n\nCompute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now).\n\nBut compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups.\n\nSo far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon.\n\nWith a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change.\n\nThe company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.",
