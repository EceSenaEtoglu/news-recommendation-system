It was after voices from the streets that I was compelled to accept,\" Sushila Karki said, speaking for the first time since being sworn into office on Friday. She said she would hand over to the new government which will emerge after elections on 5 March next year. Her appointment comes after more than 70 people were killed during anti-corruption protests which ousted the Nepal's government. Karki took the oath of office after an agreement with protest leaders from the so-called \"Gen Z\" movement.",

      "content": "US and China hold second day of trade talks as TikTok deadline looms\n\nThe talks, headed by China's He Lifeng and Scott Bessent of the US, started on Sunday\n\nAfter initially calling for TikTok to be banned during his first term, Trump has reversed his stance on the popular video-sharing app and delayed the ban three times so far.\n\nTop level trade delegations from Beijing and Washington last met in July, when they struck a deal to extend their tariffs truce by another 90 days until 10 November.\n\nThe negotiations, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, are the latest attempt to end a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nUS and Chinese officials are holding a second day of trade talks in Spain on Monday as the deadline looms for the Chinese owner of TikTok to find a buyer or face a ban in America .\n\nThe BBC has contacted the White House and TikTok for comment.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said: \"We may let [TikTok] die. Or we may… I don't know. It depends. Up to China, it doesn't matter too much.\"\n\nIt came as expectations grow that the deadline, which is due to expire on Wednesday, will be extended for a fourth time.\n\nLast month, Trump suggested that he would keep extending the deadline until a buyer for TikTok could be found and called national security and privacy concerns related to the app and its Chinese parent company ByteDance \"highly overrated\".\n\nTrump was highly critical of TikTok during his first term in the White House but softened his position after he gained popularity on the app during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn August, The White House launched its official TikTok account.\n\nThe app is one of the world's most widely-used social media platforms, with around 170 million users in the US.\n\nDuring this week's talks, officials are also expected to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as soon as October, when they are scheduled to attend a summit in South Korea.\n\nThe tariffs truce between China and the US cut import taxes that had reached more than 100% on each other's goods.\n\nThe extension gave them more time for negotiations about \"unfair trade practices\" and to address national security issues, the White House said.",

      "content": "Zulu king challenges professor to stick fight\n\nProf Xulu told the BBC he took the king's personal challenge as a joke, however he said he was worried for his safety in case he was attacked by other Zulus.\n\n\"We are angry and we will do anything to protect and preserve our cultures,\" he said, according to the Timeslive news site.\n\nKing Misuzulu kaZwelithini issued the challenge to Prof Musa Xulu in front of thousands of people who had gathered at his newly built royal palace for the annual Reed Dance.\n\nThe king of South Africa's large Zulu community has challenged a professor and cultural expert to a stick fight, saying he had been insulted, along with the entire Zulu nation.\n\n\"I have received threats from hired assassins,\" he said, adding that he had lodged a formal complaint with the police.\n\nKing Misuzulu did not specify exactly what Prof Xulu had said to anger him but he was quoted as saying: \"It pains me to see another man telling me how to do my job.\"\n\n\"It is okay if he is against me, but when he insults me, he insults the Zulu nation as well,\" he said, according to the IOL site, in what was reportedly an unusually short speech on one of the major events in the traditional Zulu calendar.\n\n\"If his friends are here, go and tell him that there is a fighting ring - if he wants a stick fight because I can take him up,\" said the king, aged 50.\n\nProf Xulu told the BBC he believes the king was angered by an interview he gave to local media, in which he said that the move to the new eMashobeni palace could be seen as wasteful, given that 152 million rand ($9m; £6.5m) had been spent on renovating the Enyokeni palace where the reed dance had been held since 1984, when the ceremony was introduced to South Africa.\n\nBut \"talking about public finance is not an insult,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not his spokesperson,\" he added, noting that he has doctorates in Zulu music and cultural tourism.\n\n\"I have nothing personal against the king.\"\n\nOn the question of stick-fighting, he said this was part of Zulu culture but those fighting had to be equals and \"I'm not equal to the king\".\n\nThe 64-year-old professor also said he had not done any stick-fighting since before he was a teenager.\n\nKing Misuzulu was crowned in 2022, after a year-long feud following the death of his father, long-time King Goodwill Zwelithini, and then his mother shortly afterwards.\n\nTwo of his brothers challenged Misuzulu's claim to the throne but he has been recognised by both the Zulu royal household and the South African state.\n\nThe throne has no formal political power, but about a fifth of South Africa's 64 million people are Zulu and its monarchy remains hugely influential with a yearly taxpayer-funded budget of more than $4.9m (£3.5m).\n\nThe Zulu kingdom has a proud history. It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.",

Everyone has the right to protest, but not in a way that influences or endangers our race.\"\n\nClashes continued after the race was abandoned, with protesters throwing bottles of water and other objects at police.\n\nRace organisers had already shortened the 21st and final stage of the Vuelta from 111.6km to 103.6km.\n\nOrganisers did not specify a reason for the section removed, which would have crossed the plush Madrid neighbourhood of Aravaca.\n\nCycling journalist Brian Smith told BBC Sport: \"They realised [there could be disruption] a few days ago when the protesters stopped a stage going into Bilbao.\n\n\"So there was always a contingency in place and the riders all voted to ride into Madrid.

Israel has strongly denied such allegations.\n\nAn emergency meeting of Arab and Islamic states is taking place in Qatar in response to Israel's air strike on Hamas leaders in Doha last week.\n\nOn Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that \"Qatar has been a very great ally. Israel and everybody else, we have to be careful. When we attack people we have to be careful.\"\n\nDeparting for Israel on Saturday, the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said Trump \"didn't like the way [the Qatar attack] went down\".\n\nDuring his visit, Rubio will meet Israeli leaders to discuss the war in the Gaza Strip and other key issues affecting the Middle East.\n\nThe Israeli strike on Qatar's capital was last week condemned by the UN Security Council.\n\n\"Council members underscored the importance of de-escalation and expressed their solidarity with Qatar,\" the 15-member council said in a statement.\n\nIsrael defended its action, with President Isaac Herzog saying that the strike was necessary to \"remove some of the people if they are not willing to get a deal\" to end the war.\n\nHamas said its negotiating team survived the Israeli strike on 9 September - but five of its members were killed, including the son of the group's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. A Qatari security officer was also killed.\n\nQatar has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel.\n\nIt has hosted the Hamas political bureau since 2012 and is a close US ally, hosting a large American airbase in the desert near Doha.",

      "content": "Madeleine McCann suspect turns down Met Police interview\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Thomas Mackintosh Share Save\n\nReuters Christian Brückner has not been charged over Madeleine's disappearance\n\nThe prime suspect in the high-profile case of Madeleine McCann's disappearance has declined to be interviewed by the Metropolitan Police, the force has said. The Met said an international letter of request was sent to Christian Brückner, ahead of his imminent release for a separate offence, which he later rejected. German national Brückner, 48, has never been charged with any crime in relation to the McCann case and denies any involvement. Madeleine vanished in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007. She and her siblings had been left sleeping in a holiday apartment while her parents, Kate and Gerry, went for dinner at a nearby restaurant.\n\nThey had checked in on the children periodically until Kate discovered Madeleine was missing at around 22:00. Brückner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman at her home in Praia da Luz in 2005. German authorities have said he will be released by Wednesday. Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell said Brückner remains a suspect in the Met Police's own investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. He has been the prime suspect in the German and Portuguese investigations since 2020 and 2022, respectively. \"We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an International Letter of Request which has been submitted,\" Det Ch Insp Cranwell said. \"It was subsequently refused by the suspect. In the absence of an interview, we will nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry. \"We can provide no further information while the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nHandout Madeleine McCann disappeared in 2007, then aged three\n\nMadeleine's disappearance has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world. German prosecutors have pointed to evidence - including mobile phone data - indicating Brückner may have been in the area when she vanished, and have consistently insisted that they think he is responsible. However, they have not found strong enough evidence to bring charges. Brückner, who spent many years in the Algarve, was a drifter, a petty criminal and a convicted sex offender. He has several previous convictions, including for sexually abusing children in 1994 and 2016. Portuguese and German police conducted a fresh search between where the McCanns had been staying and addresses linked to Brückner in June this year, but this yielded no breakthroughs.\n\nPA Media Investigators have been searching scrubland and abandoned buildings in the latest searches for Madeleine McCann",

It did not give details.\n\nThe self taught multi-instrumentalist rose from child poverty to international fame - with Miles Davis calling him the most \"important musician on the planet\".\n\nHermeto Pascoal, the innovative Brazilian composer famed for his blend of jazz and traditional music, has died at the age of 89.\n\nThe artist was primarily a pianist and flutist, but also played saxophone, guitars, drums, and accordions - and frequently incorporated household objects into his work.\n\nWhile recording his debut album Slaves Mass for Warner Brothers in 1976, he brought a pair of live pigs into the studio.\n\nBorn on 22 June 1936 in a rural settlement north-east of Alagoas, he was unable to work outside with his family because of his albinism, and taught himself music while spending his days indoors.\n\nAged 10, he began playing at dances and weddings, before going on to play forró and other traditional Brazilian music across the region.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he moved to Rio de Janeiro and discovered the city's jazz scene, performing in nightclubs and joining a radio orchestra.\n\nHis blend of jazz and traditional folk styles sparked the attention of Brazil's biggest stars in the genre.\n\nThe singer Elis Regina performed with Pascoal, as did and percussionist Airto Moreira.\n\nThe latter accompanied him on a tour to the US, where he was introduced to Miles Davis.\n\nBut despite earning the respect of luminaries in the jazz world, Pascoal rejected the label as a jazz musician, and said he owed as much to Brazilian music like chorinho and samba.\n\n\"When they think I am doing one thing I am already doing something else... It's very liquid,\" he told Jazz World in 2022.\n\nPascoal's family announced his death on his Instagram page on Saturday.\n\nIt urged people \"to let a single note ring - from an instrument, your voice, or a kettle - and offer it to the universe\" if they wanted to honour him.",

The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.\n\nOutside of the UK watch on YouTube\n\nOne of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.\n\nFamily handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda\n\nMia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.\n\nWarsan Tower in Dubai, from which Monic Karungi fell in May 2022\n\nFinding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.\n\nMr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver\n\n\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\". When asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. \"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run.\n\nTroy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa\n\nHe says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. \"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. \"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022.\n\nInstagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died\n\nMonic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. \"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation.\n\nInstagram Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan, also died after falling from a Dubai high-rise building\n\nKayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. \"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us.\n\nMonic's family in rural Uganda say Monic always had the ambition to seek a better life",

In April the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, launched an inquiry into whether past ANC governments interfered with the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes, amid criticism from the families of victims.\n\nIn June an inquest was opened into one of the period’s most notorious crime: the deaths of four men known as the Cradock Four, who were stopped at a roadblock in 1985 by security officers and beaten, strangled with telephone wire, stabbed and shot to death.",

      "content": "Woman held by Taliban warns British couple 'dying' in prison\n\n2 days ago Share Save Freya Chappell and Maia Davies Share Save\n\nWatch: Faye Hall recalls being detained with Mr and Mrs Reynolds\n\nAn American woman detained by the Taliban alongside a British couple has told the BBC they are \"literally dying\" in prison and that \"time is running out\". Faye Hall was arrested with Peter, 80, and Barbie Reynolds, 76 on 1 February when returning to Bamiyan Province, Afghanistan, where the couple lived. While Ms Hall was released after two months, Peter and Barbie remain in prison and still do not know why they are being held. The Foreign Office (FCDO) said it was supporting the family of a couple being held in Afghanistan.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast in her first interview since being released, Ms Hall broke down in tears when asked what she would like to tell the couple. \"I love them, I know they will be out very soon, don't ever give up.\" Mr and Mrs Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years prior to their arrest - the reason for which has not been confirmed despite four court appearances. The pair had Afghan citizenship and ran a charity programme in the country, approved by the Taliban when they took power in 2021. Ms Hall said the group, which also included an interpreter, had flown from Kabul to Bamiyan Province in a privately chartered plane when they were stopped at a check point. They then spent days on the road being driven between police stations and prisons. She described the conditions in which they had been held, including cramped cells and a maximum security prison holding \"murderers\", fenced with barbed wire and where guards carried machine guns.\n\nPA Media Peter and Barbie Reynolds lived in Afghanistan for 18 years prior to their arrest in February\n\nShe warned that their health had rapidly deteriorated in prison, with Barbie losing significant weight and unable to stand or walk on one occasion. She also cautioned that Peter had been getting sicker despite receiving medication from the Qatari government, which he required daily after undergoing heart surgery and cancer treatment. \"We just have these elderly people, they're literally dying, and time is running out.\" She stressed that the conditions were taking a mental toll as well as physical, because \"every day you do not know where you'll be tomorrow\". \"It's not a healthy environment and we were the only foreigners there,\" she added. The pair's son previously told the BBC he feared they would die in prison, cautioning that Peter had suffered serious convulsions and Barbie was \"numb\" from anaemia and malnutrition. The UN warned in July that the couple could perish \"in such degrading conditions\" if they did not receive medical care at once, calling their detention \"inhumane\".\n\nReuters Faye Hall at the Qatari embassy in Kabul after being released in late March",

Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time in Botswana, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil.\n\nAs the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems.\n\nThere is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally.\n\nHe said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … or Hungary or the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.”\n\nLGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as the first transgender member of the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according to data from advert tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nIn the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”.\n\nDuring election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+.\n\nBefore the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right parties made big gains, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally.\n\nIn Indonesia, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote.\n\nThe Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”",

The organisation had tweeted a message of good luck to Baci, 28, in advance of her attempt.\n\nThe event was trending on social media and videos show that as the huge red pan was being lifted, one side buckled and the supporting legs gave way, however the food did not spill.\n\nAfterwards the giant dish of jollof rice, which also included 168kg of goat meat, was divided into individual portions and distributed to the huge crowds.\n\nThe chef told BBC Pidgin that it took her a year to plan how she would tackle the mammoth challenge.\n\n\"We [Nigerians] are the giant of Africa, and jollof is a food that everybody knows Africans for,\" she said.\n\n\"It would make sense if we had the biggest pot of jollof rice, it would be nice for the country.\"\n\nShe was assisted by 10 other chefs in red uniforms wielding long wooden spoons to stir the food.\n\nManufacturing the giant steel vessel to hold her dish took a team of 300 people two months to make but one of its legs gave way at the crucial time.\n\nJollof rice is a staple in several West African countries, featuring rice simmered in a tomato sauce, often paired with meat or seafood.\n\nBaci won a competition for her version of jollof rice in 2021, and then became a national sensation in 2023 when she claimed the world cooking marathon record - an exhausting 93 hours and 11 minutes, or nearly four days.\n\nHowever, she was later surpassed by Irish chef Alan Fisher.

That is expected to fall to about 13% this year, though Trump's words suggest he feels that figure is not enough.\n\nThe US president's message came during heightened tensions between Nato allies and Russia after more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace on Wednesday.\n\nWarsaw said the incursion was deliberate, but Moscow downplayed the incident and said it had \"no plans to target\" facilities in Poland.\n\nDenmark, France and Germany have joined a new Nato mission to bolster the alliance's eastern flank, and will move military assets eastwards.\n\nLast week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also made a demand to European nations over the purchase of Russian oil and gas.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, he said: \"We have to stop [buying] any kind of energy from Russia, and by the way, anything, any deals with Russia. We can't have any deals if we want to stop them.\"\n\nSince 2022, European nations have spent around €210bn (£182bn) on Russian oil and gas, according to the think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, much of which will have funded the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe EU has previously committed to phasing out the purchases by 2028. The US want that to happen faster - partly by buying supplies from them instead.\n\nTrump's message was to Nato, not the EU, therefore including nations such as Turkey, a major buyer of Russian oil and a country that has maintained closer relations with Moscow that any other member of the alliance.\n\nPersuading Ankara to cut off Russian supplies may be a far harder task.\n\nTrump's most recent threat of tougher sanctions on Russia came earlier in September after the Kremlin's heaviest bombardment on Ukraine since the war began.\n\nAsked by reporters if he was prepared to move to the \"second phase\" of punishing Moscow, Trump replied: \"Yeah, I am,\" though gave no details.\n\nThe US previously placed tariffs of 50% on goods from India - which included a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for the war in Ukraine.",

Staff and some 75 cats and dogs were evacuated from the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter in Billings, Montana, when the building filled with smoke on Wednesday. The incinerator is usually used by animal control officers to dispose of euthanised animals, but local authorities said it can also be used by law enforcement to burn seized narcotics. The cats and dogs have been relocated, and the animals which experienced the most smoke exposure are now under supervision.\n\nThe incident was caused when smoke was pushed in the wrong direction because of negative pressure, according to Assistant City Administrator Kevin Iffland. Shelter executive director Triniti Halverson said she was unaware that a drug burn was happening. \"I can firmly and confidently say that, as the Executive Director, I did not know that they were disposing of extremely dangerous narcotics onsite,\" she wrote in a statement. \"My team and my animals had been confirmed to have been exposed to meth,\" she said. Before evacuating themselves, many employees put on masks and helped get the animals out. Some staff were exposed to the smoke for more than an hour, and several began to feel sick. All 14 went to the emergency room, where they spent about three hours in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to combat the effects of smoke inhalation. FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker told CBS News that the agency routinely uses outside facilities for controlled drug evidence burns.\n\nAP An employee walks a dog outside of the shelter on Friday",

      "content": "Press freedom around the world has suffered its sharpest fall in 50 years as global democracy weakens dramatically, a landmark report has found.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), democracy has declined in 94 countries over the last five years and only a third have made progress.\n\n“Democracy faces a perfect storm of autocratic resurgence and acute uncertainty, due to massive social and economic changes,” Kevin Casas-Zamora, the secretary-general of the thinktank, said.\n\n“To fight back, democracies need to protect key elements of democracy, like elections and the rule of law, but also profoundly reform government so that it delivers fairness, inclusion and shared prosperity.”\n\nThe International IDEA’s survey – the Global State of Democracy Report 2025 – is published annually and considered the most comprehensive of its kind, covering 174 countries and measuring democratic performance from 1975.\n\nThe survey found that the freedom of the press had worsened in a quarter of the countries, marking the broadest deterioration since the beginning of the dataset.\n\nThe three largest declines were seen in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso and Myanmar, all suffering historically high levels of civil conflict, poverty and political instability. The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his government used defamation lawsuits to silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year.\n\nThe report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. In New Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently.\n\n“Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes.\n\nChile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families.\n\nThe thinktank highlighted some positive developments: Africa recorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too.\n\nBut the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote.\n\n“These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said.\n\nIn 2021, International IDEA added the US to its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019.\n\nOne measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues.\n\n“Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.",

      "content": "More children around the world are obese than underweight for the first time, according to a UN report that warns ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets.\n\nThere are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10 – Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases.\n\nCatherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children.\n\n“Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health.”\n\nWhile 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sulakshyan, 10, and his brother Subharna, 7, watch videos at home in Kathmandu. Nepal’s urbanisation has made ultra-processed food more widespread. Photograph: Bishal Bisht/Unicef\n\nObesity has overtaken being underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is a problem even in countries with high numbers of children suffering from wasting or stunting due to a lack of food.\n\nThe report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children, used data from more than 190 countries and sources including Unicef, the World Health Organization and the World Bank.\n\nIt revealed that one in five of those aged between five and 19 are overweight, with a growing proportion of those 291 million individuals falling into the obese category: 42% in 2022, up from 30% in 2000.\n\nObesity was highest in Pacific Island countries, where there has been “a shift from traditional diets to cheap, energy-dense, imported food”, the report found. In Niue, 38% of five to 19-year-olds are obese, and the figure is 37% in the Cook Islands. Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%).\n\nIn the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%.\n\nThe steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”.\n\nChildhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life.\n\nThere is growing international concern about the damaging health impacts of UPFs, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt.\n\nUPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sweets on sale at a roadside stall in Nairobi. In the past 20 years, the percentage of obese adolescent girls in Kenya has more than doubled to 13%. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nNomathemba Chandiwana, chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Cape Town, South Africa, said: “We often only think of malnutrition here as underweight or stunting, but obesity has the same long-term consequences.\n\n“About one in eight children are overweight or have obesity, while one in four are stunted. That double burden is shaping a generation’s health,” she said, adding that children were targeted by “relentless” marketing of fast food, even in schools.\n\n“It’s really tough trying to tackle both undernutrition and obesity at the same time. South Africa is a middle-income country, but still deeply unequal. Many children grow up both hungry and surrounded by cheap, poor-quality food.\n\n“Most of the attention and resources go to undernutrition and stunting in the early years, which of course matters, but obesity isn’t always seen as malnutrition, so it slips under the radar,” she said.\n\nGrowing rates of childhood obesity will have a major impact economically. The World Obesity Federation has previously estimated that by 2035, the global cost of overweight and obesity will surpass $4tn (£2.9tn) annually.\n\nView image in fullscreen Children in Kampala, Uganda, consume snacks and sugary drinks during a school break. Obesity is not always seen as malnutrition. Photograph: Amaury Falt-Brown/Unicef\n\nThe report highlighted the positive action of Mexico’s ban on the sale and distribution of UPFs in schools.\n\nBut it added that “the unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments”.\n\nUnicef called on governments to act on this by using labelling, marketing restrictions, taxes and subsidies. It suggested banning junk foods and their marketing in schools, and better programmes for vulnerable families to afford nutritious diets.\n\nThere should be “strong safeguards to protect public-policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry”, it said.",

      "content": "Early on 18 March 1976, Francisco Tenório Cerqueira Júnior, a Brazilian pianist who had played alongside some of Latin America’s greatest musicians, disappeared from the streets of Buenos Aires.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, his fate has remained a mystery, sparking desperate searches, raising suspicions of government complicity, and inspiring international documentaries. Now the mystery has been solved, with forensic scientists formally identifying Tenório Júnior’s body – and confirming he was a victim of Argentina’s bloody dictatorship.\n\n“He left his hotel in the centre of the city and the earth ate him,” said Carlos “Maco” Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF). “Nothing more was ever known – until now.”\n\nTenório Júnior, known to most as Tenorinho, was regarded as one of the leading figures of the bossa nova movement – Brazil’s celebrated fusion of samba and jazz. One critic praised him as a pianist with “hands of gold” and an “enormous future”.\n\nOn 17 March 1976, during a South American tour, he performed alongside the Brazilian legends Vinícius de Moraes and Toquinho at the Gran Rex in Buenos Aires. Around 3am the following morning, the 34-year-old left his downtown hotel in search of cigarettes and aspirin, and was never seen again.\n\nIn the days that followed, his fellow musicians searched frantically, combing through the hospitals and morgues. Moraes, the lyricist of The Girl from Ipanema, filed a habeas corpus writ and appealed directly to the Brazilian ambassador. By then, Tenorinho, a husband and father of four, was already dead: he had been seized by the Argentinian military and executed, his body dumped in wasteland 30km away.\n\nHis killing came less than a week before a military coup d’état, which plunged the country into a dark chapter of fear, torture and forced disappearances.\n\nOver seven years, tens of thousands of political opponents, student activists, journalists, intellectuals – and countless bystanders – would be abducted, held in clandestine detention centres, tortured and killed. Some were thrown alive from planes, others disposed of in mass graves. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were disappeared.\n\nDecades after Tenorinho’s disappearance, at the 2014 National Truth Commission, his widow, Carmen Magalhães Tenório Cerqueira, demanded answers for what happened to her husband. “Where is Tenorinho?” she pressed. “Tenório was a person who never had any involvement with politics. He was a person who lived for music … And what happened to him is really something that … is absurd,” she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Carlos Somigliana of the Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team. Photograph: Harriet Barber\n\nToquinho channelled his pain into a song called Lembranças, or Memories: “Tenório went out alone into the night / He disappeared / No one could explain.”\n\nOver the years, various witnesses came forward; a man working at a newsstand near the hotel said he saw Tenorinho taken away in a green Ford Falcon – the infamous car of choice used by Argentina’s death squads.\n\nOfficial confirmation of what happened would finally come thanks, primarily, to an Argentinian forensic team which to this day excavates and identifies those disappeared by the military regime.\n\nThe group was originally set up by the Texas forensic anthropologist Dr Clyde Snow – renowned for identifying the skeleton of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele – after Argentina’s return to democracy. They made an unusual team at first; unable to find willing colleagues, with many Argentinians still fearful of a return to the dictatorship, Snow had instead recruited a collection of anthropology students.\n\n“None of us were jumping with joy to do this, because if we started to work on this and a new military coup occurred, we would end up on the list of people who could disappear,” said Mercedes “Mimi” Doretti, one of the founders, last year. “But at the same time, we couldn’t say no.”\n\nDecades on, the group continues to search for the victims of the dictatorship, scouring archives, interviewing witnesses, corroborating timelines and conducting digs at suspected mass graves. Today, technological advances also have made it possible to conduct mass fingerprint comparisons – the technique that ultimately led to Tenorinho’s discovery. More than 1,500 bodies have been recovered, and more than 840 people identified.\n\n“At the same time that the state had been torturing, killing and throwing people from planes, they kept their bureaucratic ways of working, recording deaths, taking fingerprints of the corpses,” said Somigliana, who has worked with the EAAF since 1986. “In many cases, the state tried to avoid this, by burning the bodies, cutting hands off, but in others they left a chain of documents.”\n\nWhile the team had been seeking Tenorinho’s fingerprints for some years, his case gained momentum in 2024, when the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity found an old file containing the details of a murder victim who had “appeared in a small unoccupied piece of land” in the Tigre district on 20 March 1976.\n\n“The death certificate said ‘man with many gunshots, around 30 years old, with a beard’,” said Somigliana.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dr Clyde Snow and the EAAF. Photograph: No credit\n\n“We compared the fingerprints with all of those people kidnapped in Argentina, and there was no match. Why? Because he was not from Argentina. Then we asked for the fingerprints from Brazil, and when they came, we were able to confirm that this body was him.”\n\nTenorinho’s unnamed body was buried at the Benavídez municipal cemetery on 22 March 1976, but later excavated and put into a common grave. At present, there are no plans to begin exhumations of the common grave.\n\nWhile the identification does not in itself prove the military killed Tenorinho, the manner of his murder and the way his body was discarded mirror the fate of countless others disappeared by the military.\n\nHis remains were discovered in the same area where other victims of clandestine detention centres had been dumped, cases later proven to be linked directly to the regime. He was also shot more than once, the typical way the military killed victims. While the typical registration of the death – taking the fingerprints and photos of the body – was conducted, his identification was not completed, a further hallmark of state crimes. The EAAF said they had no reason to doubt Tenorinho was a victim of state terrorism in the days before the military coup.\n\nTenorinho, who was born in Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, was one of 11 Brazilians kidnapped in Argentina during the dictatorship. He had no political affiliations, and it has long been surmised that he was picked up for how he looked: he wore glasses and had a long beard, features the dictatorship associated with leftists.\n\nView image in fullscreen Tenorinho on his wedding day. Photograph: c/o Family\n\nHe left behind his wife, Carmen, who was eight months pregnant at the time of his disappearance, and four other children. His parents, who for years sought answers to their son’s whereabouts, died around the 10th anniversary of his murder. His surviving family was informed of the identification this week.\n\nCarmen has passed away, along with two of the children. In a statement, the three remaining children said: “We received the news of the identification of our father’s body with surprise, of course, and with a mixture of relief and sadness. Relief because, finally, we can know with more certainty what happened to him in that sad March of 1976. Somehow, we will be closer – saddened by the confirmation that Tenório was a victim of violence and buried as an unknown, far from family, friends, music colleagues.”\n\nThey said his death deprived them of his company and forced their mother to raise five children alone, one who was born a month after their father’s disappearance. “Tenório never met his youngest son, nor his eight grandchildren,” the children wrote. “We still want and need answers. Who killed Tenório? Why? Why kill a man with no political involvement, who only lived for music?”\n\nTenorinho’s identification comes against an emerging climate of denialism in Argentina.\n\nIn late 2023, Argentina elected Javier Milei as its president – a hard-right leader who has been accused by rights organisations of attempting to “rewrite the history” of the dictatorship’s crimes. He has previously declared “there were no 30,000” people disappeared, and called into question the extent of the military’s crimes. His party has also begun dismantling the Human Rights Secretariat, downgrading the body and recently laying off hundreds of workers.\n\nLast year six lawmakers from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party visited a jail to meet prisoners convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, including Alfredo Astiz, the so-called “Angel of Death”. The politicians later claimed they were reviewing the living conditions of the detainees.\n\nThe office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity, nonetheless, is continuing its dictatorship-era work and is reviewing cases involving the discovery of unidentified corpses in public streets in the province of Buenos Aires between 1975 and 1983.\n\n“We have already identified approximately 600 files, 475 of which are under analysis,” said María Ángeles Ramos, one of the country’s lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship-era crimes.\n\nThe EAAF, which operates as a non-profit, is also committed to continuing its work. The team has become world-renowned, finding and identifying remains all over the world including genocide victims in Darfur, and the bodies of the Chilean president Salvador Allende and the guerrilla Che Guevara.",

They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”\n\nColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted. Those are the rules of democracy.”\n\nIn Latin America, 11 September is a date deeply associated with authoritarianism and violence: it was on this day in 1973 that Gen Augusto Pinochet launched a US-backed coup in Chile that ushered in 17 years of brutal military rule during which thousands were killed or forcibly disappeared.\n\nBut on Thursday jubilant crowds in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, celebrated how Bolsonaro’s conviction had given new meaning to the notorious date.\n\n“I’m really overflowing with joy. This is such a symbolic day for us,” said Renan Vidal, a bank worker who was also celebrating his 37th birthday as Bolsonaro and seven co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy.\n\n“It’s the best birthday present ever,” said Vidal, who wore a rainbow flag over his shoulders. “I’m part of the LGBT community and our community was one of the worst affected by the Bolsonaro government. So for us it’s a moment to commemorate,” he added as fireworks exploded above the throng.\n\nYucca Nani, 34, said her generation associated 11 September with another terrible event: the 9/11 attacks in the US. “It was the day that changed the history of the modern world,” she said, adding: “Now in Brazil [the date] has a new meaning, which is Bolsonaro’s conviction.”\n\nAlso at the street party was Beatriz Matos, an anthropologist whose husband, the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, was murdered in the Amazon with British journalist Dom Phillips during Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. Many believe Bolsonaro’s violent, pro-gun rhetoric and dismantling of environmental and Indigenous protections helped create the backdrop for the crime.\n\n“I feel relief, happiness and fire in my eyes,” Matos said of Bolsonaro’s demise. “We must celebrate. Justice is being done!”\n\nBeto Marubo, an Indigenous leader who is godfather to Pereira’s son, said: “This is a special day for us Indigenous people and for minorities … We were the ones who most suffered under Bolsonaro and this is a breath of justice.”\n\nThose festivities contrasted with the ire of Bolsonaro backers, in and outside of Brazil.\n\nThe US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, accused Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge who oversaw Bolsonaro’s trial, of “laying waste to the rule of law” and “driving relations between our two great nations to their darkest point in two centuries”.\n\nBolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who has spent months lobbying Trump officials over his father’s fate, told Reuters he expected “a firm response with actions from the US government” after Thursday’s ruling.\n\nDescribing Bolsonaro as the victim of a “political execution”, Trump has hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and announced sanctions and visa revocations against supreme court judges and other officials.\n\nAsked on Thursday if he was planning further sanctions, Trump replied: “I thought he was a good president of Brazil and it’s very surprising that [this conviction] could happen.”\n\n“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” he added.\n\nTrump’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, said: “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch-hunt.​”\n\nAt the carnival-style party in Brasília, revellers shrugged off those US warnings – as did Brazil’s foreign ministry which said “threats like the one made today by [Rubio] … will not intimidate our democracy”.\n\n“Let them do it,” Vidal said of possible further US pressure. “I think Brazil’s institutions are very solid and we will not cave in to Trump’s sanctions, however powerful his country may be.”\n\nA carnival parade called the Victory of Democracy Procession is planned in Rio on Friday night.",

      "content": "A congressional staffer from Mexico’s ruling party has resigned after being called out online for comments he made on a major Mexican television news program about Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk’s murder.\n\nThe news network, Milenio, also released a public apology after the United States’ deputy secretary of state – a former ambassador to Mexico – evidently threatened to have Donald Trump’s presidential administration revoke any US visas on which it may count.\n\nThe episode that unfolded at Milenio continued a trend of people losing their jobs over commentary about Kirk – a self-proclaimed free-speech advocate – deemed offensive by American conservatives, though in this instance it was outside the US.\n\nKirk, a close Trump ally, was shot dead Wednesday while speaking at a university in Utah. Following his death, conservative commentators, activists and public officials in the US have engaged in social media campaigns against people accused of disrespecting Kirk’s memory.\n\nA Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended.\n\nOn Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador, warned on X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”.\n\n“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the state department can protect the American people,” said Landau, who was appointed US ambassador to Mexico and served from 2019 to 2021 during Trump’s first presidency.\n\nPeople began responding to Landau’s post with examples of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk’s death. Among those was a clip of Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for the ruling Morena party, speaking on a television news program on Milenio.\n\nRamírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk’s killing.\n\n“I think if Charlie Kirk lived, he may like what I am about to say, because what I am about to say is very ‘anti-woke’,” Ramírez facetiously said. “He was given a spoonful of his own chocolate. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. They gave a spoonful to someone who was financed by the National Rifle Association – a political association that is of the extreme right, pro-Trump, of the most radical wing of the Republicans.”\n\nRamírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”.\n\nAfter a post tagging Milenio and the Morena party made Landau aware of Ramirez’s comments, he responded with an image reading “El Quitavisas”, roughly meaning “the visa remover”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico.\n\n“Really, Milenio? This is the level of ‘discourse’ that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,” Landau wrote.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later that evening, Ramirez officially announced his resignation from the parliamentary group for the Morena party within the Mexican house of representatives.\n\nOthers who had similarly lost their jobs or been disciplined at them over commentary about Kirk’s killing have included journalists, academic workers, teachers, nurses a Secret Service employee, a firefighter and a worker for an NFL team.\n\nPreviously, the Trump administration has targeted people, including students and academic workers, for expressing pro-Palestinian sentiments on social media and for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nThe FBI announced on Friday that Kirk’s alleged killer had been arrested after a two-day manhunt.",

      "content": "British authorities may have certain concerns about the cyber-spying threat from vehicles made in China, but it turns out the country’s manufacturers have security worries of their own.\n\nInsurers have told Chinese carmakers they need critical modifications for vehicles on British streets: namely, tougher locking devices to make them harder to steal.\n\nWith an average of 11 reported vehicle thefts an hour in the UK, and car crime comparatively rare under Beijing’s strict authoritarian regime, industry sources said it had been a “swift learning curve”.\n\nAdditions to cars exported to the UK from China have ranged from the simply mechanical, such as lockable wheel nuts and an extra layer of steel around the car door locks, to software to detect and guard against unauthorised entry.\n\nSales of Chinese cars have risen sharply in Britain this year, now accounting for about one in 12 of all new cars sold, including those made by MG and electric car firm BYD. New entrants such as Chery, which started to sell its own-brand petrol SUVs this month, have sold about 20,000 new cars in the UK since launching the Omoda and Jaecoo brands here earlier this year.\n\nNew models for import are assessed for risk on behalf of insurers, with tests including a two-minute “attack test”, whose results led to a range of Chinese prototypes being beefed up against car thieves.\n\nBen Townsend, the head of automotive at Thatcham Research, a vehicle risk intelligence company, said: “We’ve worked closely with Chinese vehicle manufacturers advising on vehicle security enhancements for the UK market.\n\n“In China, vehicle crime is not the same challenge we experience in the UK and Europe, so certain anti-theft features – like immobilisers, door shielding to prevent access to internal locking mechanisms, and software-based intrusion detection – haven’t historically been prioritised.”\n\nHe added: “These features often don’t require major structural interventions, which means they can be applied to completed new models, and we’ve found Chinese brands to be highly responsive and agile in implementing improvements.”\n\nChery executives said modifications had been swiftly delivered in the Chinese production process. Factory and other staff typically work a six-day week, on lower wages that have contributed to Chinese cars underpricing western comparators.\n\nOli Lowe, the UK head of product for Chery UK, said the Chinese manufacturer had dedicated regional research and development centres to get its cars ready for sale here. He said: “Simple but crucial adaptations, such as the addition of locking wheel bolts, ensure that vehicles not only meet local requirements but also deliver enhanced security and customer confidence for our buyers in the UK.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "content": "Military history is littered with the corpses of apex predators.\n\nThe Gatling gun, the battleship, the tank. All once possessed unassailable power – then were undermined, in some cases wiped out, by the march of new technology.\n\n“Speed and stealth and firepower,” the head of the Australian Submarine Agency, Jonathan Mead, told the Guardian two years ago of Australia’s forthcoming fleet of nuclear submarines. “The apex predator of the oceans.”\n\nBut for how much longer?\n\nIn the first quarter of the 21st century, nuclear submarines have proven a formidable force: essentially undetectable deadly attack weapons. Some also carry a vital “second-strike” deterrent effect: any attack on a country armed with nuclear-powered submarines is made with the knowledge that retaliation is certain – from a warship hidden beneath the waves.\n\nBut a drumbeat of declarations – much of it speculative, but most of it from China, the very nation the Aukus pact was established to counter – report rapid developments in submarine-detection technologies: vast networks of acutely sensitive sonar arrays; quantum sensing; improved satellite tracking able to spot tiny perturbations in the ocean’s surface; technologies that detect minute disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field; real-time AI processing of vast reams of data.\n\nCould emerging technologies render the last opaque place on Earth – the oceans – transparent?\n\nIt may not be so binary. The oceans may become, in parts, less impenetrable: key contested sea lanes and littoral areas may be intensely surveilled, while remote, deep trenches remain arcane.\n\nForecasting a future conflict is fraught. But the consequences for Australia, having dedicated an extraordinary $368bn towards its Aukus nuclear submarine fleet, are immense: will the apex predator of today become the prey of tomorrow?\n\nOne brutal assessment put it in stark terms: Australia’s fleet of nuclear-powered submarines may end up being “billion-dollar coffins”.\n\nQ&A What is Aukus pillar one? Show Pillar one of the Australia-UK-US (Aukus) agreement involves Australia being given the technology to command its own fleet of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. There are two stages: • First, Australia will buy between three and five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US, the first of these in 2032. But before any boat can be sold to Australia, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that the US relinquishing a submarine will not diminish its navy’s undersea capability. The US submarine fleet now has only three-quarters of the submarines it needs (49 boats of a force-level goal of 66). And there are significant concerns the US cannot build enough submarines for its own needs, let alone any for Australia. • Second, by the “late 2030s”, according to the \"optimal pathway\" outlined in Australia’s submarine industry strategy, the UK will launch the first specifically designed and built Aukus submarine for Britain’s Royal Navy. The first Australian-built Aukus submarine, for the Royal Australian Navy, will be in the water “in the early 2040s”. Australia will build up to eight Aukus boats, with the final vessels launched in the 2060s. Each of Australia’s nuclear submarines is forecast to have a working life of about three decades. Australia will be responsible for securing and storing the nuclear waste from its submarines - including high-level nuclear waste and spent fuel (a weapons proliferation risk) - for thousands of years.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nUnderwater arms race\n\nThere is an arms race under way underwater, dedicated to perfecting the technologies that can find submarines, and finding new ways to keep them hidden.\n\nVast resources are being poured into improving detection technologies and developing new ones: drones, sonobuoys, satellites, magnetometers, quantum sensors. All seek to shrink the spaces where submarines can hide.\n\nEverything is being monitored: the tiniest disturbance in waves across vast stretches of ocean, fractionally altered sea temperatures, faint magnetic disturbances, bioluminescent trails – each could give a tiny clue to a submarine’s path. Combined, they could reveal precisely where it is.\n\nAllied to the extraordinary data-processing power of artificial intelligence, these present a formidable threat to submarines’ invisibility. AI programs are able to cut through the “noise” of masses of information, spotting unseen patterns or finding connections between disparate pieces of data, imperceptible to a human analyst.\n\nMuch of the technological advancement is being driven by China.\n\nSubmarines, made of metal, cause tiny distortions in the Earth’s magnetic field as they move through the water, changes increasingly detectable to sophisticated magnetometers.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nLast year a research team from Shanghai Jiao Tong University reported the development of a new seabed sensor able to detect the faint electromagnetic waves generated by a rotating submarine propeller from nearly 20km away, about 10 times the previous detection range.\n\nAnd in a peer-reviewed study published in December, researchers in Xi’an claimed to have developed an airborne magnetometer that can track the persistent trace of a submarine’s magnetic wake.\n\nQuantum sensors, which can detect infinitesimally small perturbations in the environment at an atomic level, promise even greater sensitivity and accuracy.\n\nIn April scientists from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said they had developed a drone-mounted quantum sensor system that could track submarines with pinpoint accuracy. They claim the coherent population trapping atomic magnetometer is as sensitive as the MAD-XR system used by Nato countries but far cheaper, and so able to be deployed at a massive scale.\n\nThese are the technologies that are known about but, as Dr Anne-Marie Grisogono of Flinders University points out, if an adversary had the capability to accurately detect submarines, would it tell anyone?\n\nThe arms race is, of course, accelerating on both sides – designers are working on counter-detection measures to make submarines ever more covert: anechoic tiles to defeat or confuse sonar; cooling systems to weaken detection by thermal imaging or infrared detection by satellites; “degaussing” submarines to reduce magnetic signatures; and using pump-jet propulsors to produce less wake.\n\n‘We should be asking bigger questions’\n\nGrisogono was a co-author of the 2020 report Transparent Oceans, which argued that by the 2050s – as new Australian Aukus boats continued to be sent to sea – there is a high likelihood nuclear submarines “will be able to be detected in the world’s oceans because of the evolution of science and technology”.\n\nShe told Guardian Australia this year: “the likelihood that the oceans will become transparent enough to render the subs essentially useless at some time in the future is basically 100%, it’s just in what time frame?\n\n“It could well be the 50s or later – or it could be much sooner. We’ve seen tremendous advances in artificial intelligence ... an accelerant for all of these detection technologies that we are seeing developed.”\n\nGrisogono argued that it may not be one technology that renders submarines detectable. She can envisage a future of “underwater meshes of networked sensors” using different technologies, all of which are expendable and none of which is critical to the network functioning.\n\n“It’s an adaptive mesh of cheap components, and importantly, it’s a distributed system, so you can’t really take it out,” she said. “You can lose quite a lot of them and still have a functioning network … and it’s cheap.\n\n“If your defensive system is really cheap and can take out really expensive assets from your opponent … the advantage is now to the defence, not to the attack.”\n\nGrisogono said Australia has an opportunity before too much is committed to Aukus to re-evaluate its capacity, not to fight a war in 20 years but in 30, 40 or 50.\n\n“We should be asking bigger questions about our defence posture,” she said. “I think acquiring these nuclear-powered submarines really only makes sense if you’re wanting to contribute and join into much bigger conflicts in the region with the US.\n\n“Perhaps when the decision was first taken, the logic of Aukus might have been defensible in some way. But does that still stand up now?”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Kym Smith/ADF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEssentially an uncrewed submarine powered by AI, the Ghost Shark, the government says, will be able to “conduct intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike at extremely long distances from the Australian continent”. With each one about the size of a minibus, they can be deployed from warships or launched off the coast.\n\nThe Guardian asked the defence minister, Richard Marles, whether the investment was a “hedge” against a future where crewed submarines were detectable.\n\n“We are very confident about Australia’s future submarines being fundamentally critical to Australia’s military capability,” Marles responded, saying the Ghost Sharks would “complement” crewed nuclear submarines.\n\n“While there’s a whole lot of advancements in technologies about detecting submarines, there’s also a lot of advancements in technologies around making submarines harder to detect, and we are really confident about … giving Australia a highly capable, long‑range submarine capability in the future.”\n\nStanding alongside the minister, Australia’s chief of navy, V Adm Mark Hammond, said he believed crewed submarines would grow more stealthy as efforts to detect them strengthened.\n\n“I’ve heard about ‘transparent oceans’ since I qualified in submarines 31 years ago, and nothing’s really changed: every advancement in detection capability is usually met by an advancement in encounter detection capability and increased stealth.”\n\nThe land and the air were “completely transparent”, Hammond said, “and no one has stopped building ships and aircraft.”\n\n“My personal belief is that the undersea battle space will continue to be increasingly congested, increasingly contested – but ultimately that is the most opaque environment on the planet, and I believe that our allies and partners will continue to enjoy the capability advantage in that space.”\n\nDetectable equals destroyable\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\nProf Peter W Singer, a strategist at the New America thinktank, cites Arthur C Clarke’s famed third law.\n\nHe tells the Guardian that the rapid pace of change across technological domains, accelerated by developments in AI, makes predicting future developments – especially beyond the span of a human or technological generation – increasingly fraught.\n\nAustralia’s first Aukus submarines are scheduled to be in the water in the 2040s. They will still be under construction into the 2060s.\n\n“Twenty years is a very long time when it comes to technology … what’s a generation for undersea warfare: is it every 30 years? Every 15 years? Every 10 years? We’re talking about a pretty substantial period of time,” Singer says.\n\nAn accelerating trend is “greater observation of the battlefield, and the worry that once stealthy systems might be detectable”.\n\n“If they’re detectable, they’re destroyable,” he says.\n\n“Military leaders around the world are wrestling with this – whether they are in the ADF, Nato, the US Navy, Marine Corps – there’s a trend where essentially the apex predators are looking around and wondering if they are now the prey.”\n\nThe Marianas Trench – largely uncharted and reaching depths beyond human exploration – might remain unknowable, Singer says, but key sea lanes in the South China Sea could be intensely surveilled.\n\nHe cites the cold war example of the GIUK Gap – naval choke points in the North Atlantic – which was populated by a battery of hydrophones designed to detect the passage of Soviet submarines.\n\nSinger predicts that undersea warfare of the future will not be a battle between crewed submarines but between hybrid fleets of new technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles, potentially working in concert with crewed subs. UUVs will be far cheaper and expendable in comparison with traditional submarines.\n\nThe terrestrial equivalent is Ukraine’s revolutionary use of cheap but lethal armed drones to counter Russia’s invasion. Expendable drones worth a few hundred dollars a unit are taking out tanks that cost tens of millions, halting entire offensives.\n\n“The uncrewed systems are not all going to be like a pet on a leash, they’re going to be increasingly operating on their own,” Singer says.\n\n“So you may have some physically large systems that need to go long distances and carry massive payloads, but you may also have smaller systems, maybe with less range but, because they’re smaller, they’re cheaper, and you can essentially fill the battle space with them.”\n\nThe upshot is a balancing act, Singer says – accepting that decision-makers have neither a perfect view of the future nor an unlimited budget.\n\n“I am not saying ‘don’t buy Virginia Class’ or ‘don’t buy Aukus’,” he says. “I think they do bring value. The question is how much of a bet do you want to make?”",

      "content": "More than 300 South Korean workers arrived at Incheon international airport on Friday afternoon, ending a week-long ordeal that began with the US Department of Homeland Security’s largest ever single-site raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and has left South Korea questioning whether it can trust its closest ally.\n\nThe 316 Koreans, along with 14 workers of other nationalities, landed shortly after 3pm local time on a chartered Korean Air flight after being detained since 4 September at a Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site in Georgia.\n\nThere was widespread anger across the political spectrum in South Korea at the behaviour of the US authorities, with one newspaper referring to the workers being treated like “prisoners of war” and another describing Koreans as feeling stabbed in the back by their closest ally.\n\nThe workers had requested privacy, and the assembled media kept their distance as the returnees emerged in small groups to board waiting buses. Most wore face masks and carried only small bags; many looking worn out but bearing the weary relief of people whose ordeal had finally ended.\n\nAddressing reporters, the presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, said he had come to offer words of encouragement. “We did our best, but I’m sorry we couldn’t bring them back to their homeland sooner,” he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen South Korean workers freed after days of detention in the US arrive at Incheon. Photograph: AP\n\n“We’re in an age of new normal in dealing with the United States,” Kang said. “The standard changes every time and constantly there has to be deal-making, not only on tariffs, but it’ll also be the case with security issues.”\n\nThe workers had been building a $4.3bn (£3.2bn) battery plant, which is crucial to Hyundai’s electric vehicle ambitions in the US. Most were employed by LG Energy Solution or its subcontractors.\n\nThe detention stemmed from workers using B1 business visas and the 90-day visa waiver programme (Esta) for what US authorities deemed actual employment rather than permitted activities such as meetings or training.\n\nKorean companies have long relied on this “grey zone” because the official H-1B work visas take months to obtain and South Korea lacks the dedicated quota allocations that other US trade partners enjoy. Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice.\n\nThe South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, delivered his sharpest warning yet to Washington on Thursday, stating that Korean businesses would “hesitate to make direct investments” if the US failed to resolve visa issues quickly.\n\nView image in fullscreen A television at Incheon airport on Friday, showing South Korean detainees lined up against a bus after the raid by US federal agents. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty\n\n“Korean businesses that have entered the United States are likely in a state of serious bewilderment,” he said. “This isn’t long-term permanent employment, but to establish facilities and equipment for factories; we need technicians to install machinery and equipment. The US doesn’t have such personnel, and they won’t give visas for [our workers] to stay and work.”\n\nThe workers’ departure from Georgia was delayed by a day after President Donald Trump offered to let them stay and train Americans, but only one person chose to remain.\n\nSouth Korea’s foreign minister, Cho Hyun, flew to the US to meet his counterpart, Marco Rubio, securing assurances that workers would not be restrained while being transported.\n\nThe concession addressed a particularly sensitive grievance after ICE’s release of video footage showing Korean workers being led away in chains, evoking historical experiences of subjugation by foreign powers.\n\nThe episode has generated unprecedented public anger. A survey by the local broadcaster MBC found 68% of respondents believed the US government “did not show consideration for South Korea as an ally” in handling the situation.\n\nKorean media responses were scathing across the political spectrum. Seoul Economic Daily described workers being treated like “prisoners of war”; the conservative Chosun Ilbo called it a “merciless arrest operation” representing a “breach of trust”; while the progressive Hankyoreh asked: “Is this what you do to an ally?” and described Koreans feeling “backstabbed” after Lee’s recent meeting with Trump.\n\nAt the airport, a 75-year-old protester, Hong Jung-sik, reflected a nation’s anger when he said the detention of fellow citizens had left him feeling betrayed. “Trump, who do you think you are?” he shouted, describing the episode as a “national humiliation” and “evil behaviour”.",

      "description": "Fans grieve the loss of a fighter whose spirit transcended the confines of boxing.",
      "content": "Former boxing world champion Ricky Hatton, one of the sport’s most beloved figures, has died at the age of 46.\n\nHatton was discovered deceased at his Greater Manchester home, according to Britain’s Press Association. Greater Manchester Police confirmed the death is not being treated as suspicious.\n\nTributes poured in as the boxing world mourned his loss.\n\nFormer champion Amir Khan wrote on Facebook, “Today we lost not only one of Britain’s greatest boxers, but a friend, a mentor, a warrior, Ricky Hatton.”\n\nTyson Fury posted on Instagram, “RIP to the legend Ricky Hatton may he RIP. There will only ever be 1 Ricky Hatton. Can’t believe this, so young.” His brother Matthew shared, “I love you Richard.”\n\nHatton’s death comes just two months after he had announced a surprising comeback fight scheduled for December in Dubai against Eisa Al Dah, following a decade-long retirement since his 2012 loss to Vyacheslav Senchenko.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Hatton captured world titles at light-welterweight and welterweight, facing boxing giants including Kostya Tszyu, Floyd Mayweather, and Manny Pacquiao.\n\nPacquiao paid tribute: “He was not only a great fighter inside the ring but also a brave and kind man in life. Ricky fought bravely, not just in the ring, but in his journey through life. He truly had a good fight, and we are all blessed to have been part of his wonderful journey.”\n\nHatton’s everyman appeal, combined with his all-action fighting style and candid struggles with weight between bouts, earned him a massive following. Football star Wayne Rooney shared, “Devastated. A legend, a warrior, and a great person.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing retirement, Hatton spoke openly about his mental health challenges.\n\n“As fighters, we tell ourselves we’re strong — we train, we sweat, we take hits, we get up. But sometimes the hardest fight happens in silence, in the mind,” Khan noted.\n\nHatton’s career-defining moment came in 2005 when he defeated the formidable Kostya Tszyu for the IBF world super lightweight title before 22,000 fans in Manchester. This victory catapulted him to international stardom, with thousands of British fans following him to the United States for his biggest fights.\n\nFormer manager Frank Warren called him “superbly talented” and someone who “inspired a generation of young boxers and fans in a way very few had done before”.\n\nThough Hatton suffered his first career defeat against Mayweather in 2007 and later lost to Pacquiao in 2009, his 2012 comeback after battling depression, alcohol issues, and weight gain was considered a personal triumph despite ending in defeat.\n\nA lifelong Manchester City supporter, Hatton was honoured with a minute’s appreciation before Sunday’s derby against Manchester United, with fans from both sides applauding in tribute. Manchester City’s statement read: “Ricky was one of City’s most loved and revered supporters, who will always be remembered for a glittering boxing career that saw him win world titles at welterweight and light-welterweight.”\n\nBefore his death, Hatton had found success as a trainer, guiding Zhanat Zhakiyanov to a world bantamweight title in 2017.",

Italian Iliass Aouani took the bronze in 2:09:53.\n\n“When we entered the stadium, I was not sure if I would win,” the 33-year-old Simbu said. “I did not know if I had won. But when I saw the video screens and me on the top of the results, I felt relieved.\n\n“I made history today – the first Tanzanian gold medal at a world championships.”\n\nSmallest winning margin in a global marathon race\n\nThe finish was closer than at the 2001 championships in Edmonton, when Ethiopian Gezahegne Abera edged Kenyan Simon Biwott by a single second.\n\nSouth African Josia Thugwane won the closest Olympic men’s marathon by three seconds from South Korean Lee Bong-ju at the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nIt was a first global title for Simbu, who won bronze in the marathon at the London world championships in 2017 and finished second in the Boston marathon in April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimbu struck back for East African distance running the morning after Frenchman Jimmy Gressier became the first man born outside the region to win the 10,000m title for more than 40 years.\n\nThe early morning event opened with another incident more reminiscent of sprints than endurance races when Vincent Kipkemoi Ngetich of Kenya jumped the gun, forcing a restart.\n\nMore shocks followed as two of the fastest runners in the field, Ethiopia’s Tadese Takele and Deresa Geleta, who took gold and silver at the Tokyo city marathon in March, dropped off with less than 10km to go.\n\nThe race was wide open for much of the distance, with a couple of dozen runners in the leading cluster some 90 minutes in.\n\nThe pack then gradually thinned out as some faded in the morning heat, leaving Simbu, Petros and Aouani clear of the field coming into the stadium.\n\nEritrean-born Petros looked set to take the title back to Europe until Simbu found a late kick and ran him down at the line.\n\n“It’s like the 100 metres,” said Petros. “Coming into the finish, I was thinking about winning, so a bit of me is feeling very sad.\n\n“But I have to accept it. As an athlete, you have to learn for tomorrow, train hard, keep going and be thankful for the silver.”",

      "content": "Kathy Hochul’s nod comes after Trump described Mamdani’s 20-point lead in polls as a ‘rebellion against bad candidates’.\n\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has endorsed Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a staunch pro-Palestinian advocate who has campaigned for a more equitable allocation of the city’s resources, for mayor ahead of a closely watched November election in the financial capital of the United States.\n\nWriting in The New York Times, the state leader said on Sunday she made her decision after “frank conversations” with her fellow Democrat, who resoundingly won the support of the party’s voters in a primary election in May.\n\n“In our conversations, I heard a leader who shares my commitment to a New York where children can grow up safe in their neighbourhoods and where opportunity is within reach for every family,” Hochul wrote in the city-based newspaper.\n\n“I heard a leader who is focused on making New York City affordable — a goal I enthusiastically support,” Hochul added.\n\nMamdani, a 33-year-old left-wing politician who has promised to make buses free and freeze rents for subsidised tenants, won 56.4 percent of votes among registered Democrats in the primary race, easily beating former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nYet Cuomo, a pro-Israel candidate who joined a team of lawyers defending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against war crimes allegations in Gaza, has taken the unusual move of choosing to stay in the race, reflecting a continued divide within the Democratic Party.\n\nWhile recent polls suggest Mamdani has a 22-point lead among New York voters, some prominent New York Democrats have appeared hesitant to back him, including US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Bronx Congressman Ritchie Torres, and, until recently, Hochul — though the governor had been more positive in comments about Mamdani than the others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking in Iowa on Saturday, Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen criticised his Democratic colleagues for failing to endorse Mamdani, accusing them of the “kind of spineless politics” that “people are sick of”.\n\n“They need to get behind him, and get behind him now,” Van Hollen said.\n\nMamdani, who has campaigned alongside independent Senator Bernie Sanders and progressive Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pramila Jayapal in recent days, has received fewer endorsements from centrist Democrats like Hochul, less than two months out from the November 4 general election.\n\nThanking the governor for her announcement on Sunday, Mamdani acknowledged Hochul’s “support in unifying our party” as well as her “focus on making New York affordable”.\n\nHe also praised “her resolve in standing up to Trump”.\n\nTrump has also weighed in on the race, saying Mamdani being “up by 20” in a recent poll shows there is a “rebellion against bad candidates … they’re tired of it”.\n\n“I’m not looking at the polls too carefully, but it would look like he is going to win, and that is a rebellion,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” on Fox News on Friday, describing Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, as “my little communist mayor”.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Mamdani with 45 percent support among likely voters, and a comfortable 22-point lead over his closest rival, Cuomo, with 23 percent.\n\nRepeat Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, who cofounded the Guardian Angels to combat “violence and crime” on the New York subway in the 1970s, is polling at 15 percent, according to the Quinnipiac poll, while embattled incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, running as an independent candidate, has just 12 percent support.\n\nTrump has dismissed Sliwa as a candidate, describing the Republican candidate known for his trademark red beret as “not exactly prime time”.\n\nMamdani, meanwhile, has portrayed Adams as a “puppet” of Trump’s following meetings between the mayor and the US president and his team. Trump has described Adams as a “very nice person” but has denied recent reports that he offered the mayor an ambassadorship.",

      "content": "Hacks actress Hannah Einbinder, also an Emmy winner, calls for a free Palestine in her acceptance speech.\n\nThe Pitt, a television series centred on the trials and tribulations of American healthcare workers, has been awarded the prize for best drama at the Emmy Awards.\n\nThe HBO Max drama, set in a fictional emergency room in Pittsburgh, also took home the prizes for best leading actor and best supporting actress, for Noah Wyle and Katherine LaNasa, at the 77th edition of the awards show in Los Angeles on Sunday.\n\nWyle, who portrays the grizzled and overworked emergency physician Michael Robinavitch in the series, paid tribute to healthcare workers in his acceptance speech.\n\n“To anybody who is going on shift tonight, or coming off shift tonight, thank you for being in that job, this is for you,” Wyle said.\n\nThe Studio, a comedy about the head of a Hollywood studio trying to balance his artistic dreams with commercial realities, won 13 awards, the most on the night, including lead actor in a comedy for co-creator Seth Rogen.\n\n“I so could not wrap my head around this happening that I literally prepared nothing,” Rogen said in his acceptance speech.\n\n“I’ve never won anything in my life. When I was a kid, I bought a used bowling trophy at an estate sale. And my parents were like, ‘Yeah, that’s a good idea, you should probably buy that.'”\n\nAdolescence, the Netflix hit about a 13-year-old boy radicalised by online misogyny, won eight awards, including best limited series.\n\nSeverance, the Apple TV+ sci-fi series about employees who have undergone a procedure to separate their work memories from their personal lives, took home the best actress in a drama series award for Britt Lower and the best supporting actor in a drama series award for Tramell Tillman, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe HBO Max dark comedy Hacks, about the fraught relationship between a legendary stand-up comedian and a younger comedy writer, won best actress in a comedy series for Jean Smart and best supporting actress in a comedy series for Hannah Einbinder.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Einbinder called attention to Israel’s war in Gaza, declaring “free Palestine”.\n\nElaborating on her remarks backstage, Einbinder, who earlier this month signed a pledge not to work for Israeli companies implicated in the war, said the issue was close to her heart for many reasons.\n\n“I feel like it is my obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel, because our religion and our culture is such an important and longstanding … institution that is really separate to this sort of ethnonationalist state,” she said.\n\nEarlier, Spanish actor Javier Bardem said in a red carpet interview with Variety that he could not work with any film studio that “justifies or supports the genocide” in Gaza.\n\n“That’s as simple as that,” Bardem said.",

      "content": "North Korea has criticised the trilateral military drills as a ‘reckless show of strength’.\n\nThe United States, South Korea and Japan have started joint air and naval drills that North Korea has condemned as a “dangerous idea”.\n\nThe manoeuvres, known as “Freedom Edge”, began off South Korea’s Jeju Island on Monday and will last until Friday.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command said the exercises, which will involve enhanced ballistic-missile and air-defence scenarios, would be “the most advanced demonstration of trilateral defence cooperation to date”.\n\nMeanwhile, the South Korean Defence Ministry said it would improve the allies’ ability to counter growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea, according to The Associated Press news agency.\n\nThere have been protests in Seoul on Monday against the military exercises.\n\nIn comments published by North Korean state media on Sunday, leader Kim Jong Un’s influential sister hit out at what she called South Korea, Japan and the US’s “reckless show of strength” in “the wrong places”.\n\nKim Yo Jong, who is vice department director of the North Korean governing party’s central committee, threatened that their joint military drills would “undoubtedly bring about negative consequences for themselves”.\n\nLast week, her brother visited weapon research facilities, with Pyongyang saying it would accelerate the building of its conventional army as well as its nuclear programme.\n\nThe message was reiterated on Monday, when the country’s permanent mission to the United Nations declared that its position as a nuclear-weapons state was irreversible.\n\nPyongyang has repeatedly indicated that it is not interested in resuming nuclear negotiations with Seoul and Washington, after talks broke down during US President Donald Trump’s first term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has deepened its alliance with Moscow in recent years, sending thousands of troops to the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukraine seized territory in a surprise offensive in August 2024.\n\nThe isolated country also maintains ties with China, its largest trading partner. Earlier this month, the North Korean leader travelled to China, where he appeared beside Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at an enormous military parade.\n\nKim also held separate talks with Putin. During his visit to Beijing, Kim vowed to Xi that their countries’ “friendship will never change”.",

      "description": "It was a first for an electoral democracy. Backers say it&#039;s more transparent than what politicians do. But it has risks.",
      "content": "It was a first for an electoral democracy. Backers say it is more transparent than what politicians do. But it has risks.\n\nKathmandu, Nepal – As Nepal burned on Thursday after two days of deadly unrest that ousted a government accused of corruption, thousands of young people gathered in a heated debate to decide their nation’s next leader.\n\nTo them, the country’s mainstream politicians across the major parties were discredited: 14 governments representing three parties have taken turns at governing since 2008, when Nepal adopted a new constitution after abolishing its monarchy.\n\nBut in the wake of a brutal crackdown on protesters by security forces that killed at least 72 people, their trust in the country’s political system itself had been shattered. They wanted to select a consensus leader who would steer the country of 30 million people out of chaos and take steps towards stamping out corruption and nepotism. Just not in the way countries usually pick their heads.\n\nSo, they chose Nepal’s next leader in a manner unprecedented for any electoral democracy – through a virtual poll on Discord, a United States-based free messaging platform mainly used by online gamers.\n\nThe online huddle was organised by Hami Nepal, a Gen Z group behind the protest with more than 160,000 members.\n\nHami Nepal ran a channel on the platform called Youth Against Corruption, where a fiery debate on the country’s future brought together more than 10,000 people, including many from the Nepali diaspora. As more people tried to log in and failed, a mirrored livestream was held on YouTube to allow about 6,000 more people to see the debate.\n\nAfter hours of debate that included difficult questions for protest leaders and attempts at reaching out to potential prime minister candidates in real time, the participants chose former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki to lead Nepal. The 73-year-old took the oath of office as the country’s interim prime minister on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Nepal’s transition is only beginning, say analysts, and the approach protesters took to choose the country’s leader only underscores how a chaotic new experiment in democracy appears to be under way, with rewards as well as risks.\n\n‘Trying to figure it out together’\n\nThe Discord debate was a revolutionary counter to the traditional practice of politicians choosing leaders behind closed doors, which had displayed little transparency, say supporters of the Discord approach.\n\nDiscord enables users to connect through texts, voice calls, video calls and media sharing. It also allows communication through direct messages or within community spaces known as servers. It was one of the platforms banned by the government earlier this month alongside two dozen other popular applications, including Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nThe ban, protesters said, was the last straw that spiralled into a nationwide movement against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government. The demonstrators accused it of being unrepresentative of young people, as well as of widespread corruption and nepotism.\n\nTens of thousands of young protesters hit the streets on Tuesday, torching government buildings, including the parliament and residences of top politicians, and forcing Oli to resign. On Friday, President Ramchandra Paudel dissolved parliament and called for a general election in March.\n\nBy then, Nepal’s Gen Z protesters had turned to Discord to decide who should lead their nation until March. The social media ban was lifted after the killings earlier in the week.\n\nVirtual polls on mobile screens allowed participants to nominate their interim leader in real time, marking a radical experiment in digital democracy.\n\n“People were learning as they went,” said 25-year-old law graduate Regina Basnet, a protester who had then joined the Discord debate. “Many of us didn’t know what it meant to dissolve parliament or form an interim government. But we were asking questions, getting answers from experts, and trying to figure it out together.”\n\nThe discussion revolved around a wide range of issues Nepal must battle now, including jobs, police and university reforms, as well as the state of government healthcare, as the moderators urged the participants to focus on the main question before them: the next leader.\n\nFive names were shortlisted for the final voting: Harka Sampang, a social activist and mayor of the eastern city of Dharan; Mahabir Pun, a popular social activist running the National Innovation Centre; Sagar Dhakal, an independent politician who ran against the powerful Nepali Congress leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, in 2022; advocate Rastra Bimochan Timalsina, also known as Random Nepali on his YouTube channel, who has been advising the Gen Z protesters; and Karki.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarki, who emerged as the winner of the poll, had campaigned for an independent judiciary during her brief tenure as chief justice from 2016 to 2017. In 2012, she and another Supreme Court judge jailed a serving minister for corruption. In 2017, the government unsuccessfully tried to impeach her as chief justice after she rejected its choice for police chief.\n\nThat history added to her credentials in the eyes of the Discord voters.\n\n“The situation that I have come in, I have not wished to come here. My name was brought from the streets,” she said in an address to the nation after assuming office. “We will not stay here more than six months in any situation. We will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers.”\n\nMany people who took part in the Discord debate also suggested Balen Shah, the popular rapper-turned-mayor of Kathmandu, as their choice for interim prime minister. The Hami Nepal moderators informed the participants they could not reach Shah, who later posted his endorsement of Karki on social media.\n\nMany in Nepal believe Shah could be a frontrunner for the prime minister’s post in the March 5 elections.\n\n‘Much more egalitarian’\n\nAayush Bashyal, who was part of the Discord discussions, told Al Jazeera he witnessed a “spectrum of understanding, and it was all ‘trial and error’”.\n\n“Some people would come and belittle the ideas, which would paralyse the conversation. However, it was absolutely the need of the moment, and was an impromptu common ground to bring as many voices as possible,” he said.\n\nBashyal said some in the Discord forum also called for a restoration of Nepal’s monarchy, which was abolished in 2006 after a decade-long rebellion by left-wing forces in the country.\n\n“There was also a pro-monarchy Discord group going on side by side. Sometimes, people would share the screenshots from their chats,” the 27-year-old student of public administration at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan University told Al Jazeera. He branded the pro-monarchy group as “infiltrators”.\n\nIn the same forum, some Gen Z participants even questioned the legitimacy of the protest leaders. “You made the agenda, but we don’t know you. How we can trust you is also another issue,” one participant said.\n\nOther issues that came up during the deliberations included investigating the killings of protesters and cracking down on corruption.\n\n‘This is the future’\n\nPranaya Rana, a journalist who sends out the popular Kalam Weekly newsletter to more than 4,300 subscribers, said that using Discord made sense for a Gen Z-led movement, but that it also came with challenges.\n\n“It is much more egalitarian than a physical forum that many might not have access to. Since it is virtual and anonymous, people can also say what they want to without fear of retaliation,” he told Al Jazeera. “But there are also challenges, in that anyone could easily manipulate users by infiltration, and using multiple accounts to sway opinions and votes.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAware of how misinformation, fake news and rumours could derail such movements, the Gen Z leaders also launched a sub-room called “fact checks” on their Discord discussion page.\n\nAmong the things they debunked was a photo showing protest leader Sudan Gurung, the chief negotiator for the formation of the interim government, with Arzu Rana Deuba, the ousted foreign minister. The picture was falsely claimed to have been taken a week before, when it was actually from an event that had happened six months earlier. Gurung had met the minister to demand justice for a Nepali student who had died by suicide after he was allegedly harassed at an engineering college in neighbouring India’s Odisha state.\n\nThere were also rumours that Gurung was not a Nepali citizen, but from Darjeeling, a hill town in eastern India. A copy of his Nepali citizenship card was released in the Discord discussion room and on social media.\n\nThe Gen Z organisers also debunked claims that former King Gyanendra had met the protesters. It was found that an old video of Nepal’s last monarch interacting with youngsters was being shared on social media.\n\nIt was also discovered that multiple social media handles and profiles claiming to be the “official” youth movement had contributed to some confusion on the ground. On Thursday night, a Gen Z leader was even seen calling a Nepal military officer on the phone, warning him against potential royal interference in the formation of the next government.\n\nRana, the journalist, said the protest leaders made good use of technology, “something that Gen Z is best at”.\n\n“This is the future. We can either remain in the days of giving speeches on stages with mics or get used to talking freely on online platforms,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Gen Z is naive, but that’s to be expected. They are young, but they have shown a willingness to learn, and that’s the important part.”\n\nAnticorruption activist and the former president of Transparency International Nepal, Padmini Pradhanang, urged Gen Z protest leaders to work on what the previous governments “miserably failed at – integrity, accountability, transparency and good governance”.\n\n“These young people have only experienced kleptocracy. They have never seen true democracy or good governance,” she said.\n\nBut law graduate Basnet is not sure.\n\n“At first, it was a peaceful protest. The mood was celebratory. But the state-ordered carnage later was traumatising… The uprising and burning of private and public properties was scary, and then, with people participating in a discussion on social media to form the government has only added to the confusion,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All these events that unfolded worry me.”",

      "content": "Anthony Albanese says a landmark report on the climate risks confronting Australia is a “wake-up call” that reinforces the need for “serious” action to combat global heating.\n\nThe prime minister said the findings of the national climate risk assessment would inform the government’s soon-to-be released 2035 emissions target, while stressing the need to plan for an “orderly” energy transition to avoid losing public support for climate action.\n\nThe government on Monday released the long-awaited climate risk assessment, offering the most detailed picture of the severe and far-reaching social and economic consequences of the climate crisis for Australia.\n\nLed by the Australian Climate Service, the inaugural assessment modelled the impact of climate-related hazards such as heatwaves, drought and floods on different parts of the community, economy and environment under three global heating scenarios: above 1.5C, above 2C and above 3C.\n\nWarming across the Australian continent has already reached 1.5C, the report notes.\n\nAmong scores of findings, the modelling shows that under a 3C scenario, the number of heat-related deaths in Sydney increases by 444% and by 423% in Darwin.\n\nThe report also lays bare the heightened risk from rising sea levels on Australia’s populous coastal communities, including flooding, erosion and inundation.\n\nIt finds that by 2050, 1.5 million coastal residents would be at risk, rising to more than 3 million by 2090.\n\nThe assessment also models the economic impact, estimating the direct cost of floods, bushfires, storms and cyclones across the states and territories could reach $40bn a year in 2050 – even under a 1.5C scenario.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\n“It’s important that we don’t gild the lily or downplay its impact in any way. We have to be honest with the Australian people,” the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said of the “confronting” findings in the report.\n\nThe delays in publishing the climate risk assessment prompted accusations the government was trying bury the findings, which sources familiar with its contents had described as “intense and scary”.\n\nThe release of the report was immediately seized upon by environmentalists, climate scientists, social services groups and the Greens as evidence the government must commit to a 2035 emissions target above 75%.\n\nThe federal cabinet is expected to sign off on the 2035 target later this week after the Climate Change Authority provided its advice to Bowen last Friday.\n\nThe authority’s preliminary advice suggested a range between 65% and 75%, with most of the political debate and lobbying from industry and green groups centred on that level of ambition.\n\nBowen said the government’s target would be “controversial by definition”, acknowledging that some people would consider it too high while others would criticise it as too low.\n\nThe minister was confident cabinet would agree a target that was achievable but ambitious.\n\n“There isn’t an Australian community that isn’t impacted by climate change going forward, and there isn’t an Australian individual for whom those impacts won’t be real and material,” he said.\n\n“So at a time when the political debate is focused on the cost of action, both real and imagined, this report is a reminder, if we needed one ever, that the cost of inaction will always outweigh the cost of action.”\n\nSpeaking from Papua New Guinea, Albanese said the report was a “wake-up call for anyone who denies the science of climate change” – a cohort he suggested included members of the federal Coalition.\n\nAsked if the findings would inform the decision on the 2035 target, he said: “Of course it does”.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because you will lose support for action on climate change if people go home, they flick their switch on and the lights don’t go on.”\n\nThe opposition warned against “alarmist language” as it insisted Australia had the ability to manage the threat of climate change.\n\n“This is a moment to reassure Australians,” the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, and shadow energy minister, Ted O’Brien, said in a joint statement.\n\n‘Headwinds’ for green energy transition\n\nThe debate over Australia’s 2035 target comes amid signs the global push to net zero is losing momentum, with Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement and other countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, moderating their ambitions.\n\nBowen acknowledged the “global headwinds” facing the green energy transition but said Australia and the rest of the world must press on.\n\n“Climate change action and various elements will go through sort of various iterations of fashion – but the science won’t change, the economics won’t change, and this government’s commitment won’t change,” he said.\n\nThe Albanese government’s commitment to fighting the climate crisis was questioned as recently as Friday after it approved an extension of Woodside’s North West Shelf gas project out to 2070 – dubbed a “carbon bomb” by environmentalists.\n\nBowen defended the fossil fuel’s role in the green energy transition as he insisted the government’s “seriousness on climate action cannot be understated”.\n\nThe Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, described the report’s findings as “terrifying” while the Australian Conservation Foundation’s acting chief executive, Paul Sinclair, said it should be a “wake-up call for the Albanese government”.\n\nThe Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said the findings were “chilling”.\n\n“What this report shows is that a 2035 target of 65% means significant potential for loss of life and strain on health systems, more extreme heat, more devastating floods, crop failures, fires, global insecurity and the death of every coral reef around the world,” she said.\n\n“If Labor fails to set a science-based climate target then it’s crystal clear: they have utterly prioritised coal and gas profits at the expense of community safety and nature.”\n\nThe risk assessment will be scrutinised at a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, which was launched amid frustration from the Greens and other crossbenchers over the repeated delays in its release.",

      "description": "Governor Spencer Cox says the 22-year-old suspect spent time in &#039;dark places&#039; online.",
      "content": "The suspect in the assassination of the conservative American activist Charlie Kirk espoused left-wing views, Utah’s governor has said, amid heightened tensions and recriminations over surging political violence in the United States.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said the arrested suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, had a “leftist ideology” despite growing up in a conservative family.\n\n“We can confirm that, again, according to family and people that we’re interviewing, he does come from a conservative family. But his ideology was very different than his family, and so that’s part of it,” Cox said.\n\nCox, a Republican, did not elaborate on Robinson’s suspected motive, but said the suspect had spent time in “dark places” online.\n\n“We do know, and again, this has been well publicised, that this was a very normal young man, a very smart young man,” Cox said.\n\nAccording to public records, Robinson registered as a nonpartisan voter in Utah, while his parents are registered Republicans.\n\nIn a separate interview with CNN’s State of the Union, Cox said the information about Robinson’s left-wing views had come from interviews with family members and friends.\n\n“I really don’t have a dog in this fight. If this was MAGA, and a radicalised MAGA person, I would be saying that as well,” Cox said, referring to US President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again movement.\n\n“That’s not what they’re sharing.”\n\nCox also confirmed reports that Robinson had a romantic relationship with his transgender roommate, who was transitioning from male to female.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This partner has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now,” he said.\n\nCox said he was not aware if Robinson’s relationship had any relevance to the assassination, but that authorities were investigating.\n\n“We’re trying to figure it out. I know everybody wants to know exactly why, and point the finger, and I totally get that. I do too,” he said.\n\nKirk, the leader and cofounder of youth activist group Turning Post USA and a close ally of Trump, was shot dead on Wednesday during a speaking appearance at Utah Valley University.\n\nA key figure on the political right, Kirk was described in media profiles as a “rock star” among young conservatives, and played a pivotal role in driving the youth vote in Trump’s November re-election.\n\nA polarising figure, Kirk was lionised by conservatives as a defender of traditional values and a champion of free speech, but seen by liberals as an incendiary figure who stoked hatred towards racial minorities and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nWhile both Republican and Democratic leaders have condemned Kirk’s murder, the killing has drawn attention to the extreme political polarisation pitting everyday Americans against one another.\n\nIn the aftermath of Kirk’s assassination, some left-leaning Americans took to social media to celebrate, prompting outrage from conservatives and the launch of online campaigns to get people deemed disrespectful of Kirk’s memory fired from their jobs.\n\nOn the right, some figures invoked the rhetoric of retribution and war.\n\n“If they won’t leave us in peace, then our choice is to fight or die,” tech billionaire Elon Musk said on X.\n\nTrump, who swiftly denounced the rhetoric of the “radical left” after Kirk’s killing, has declined opportunities to stress the need for unity and avoid partisan blame since the assassination.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News’s Fox & Friends on Friday, Trump sought to paint left-wing extremism as worse than extremism on the right.\n\n“The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don’t want to see crime,” Trump said.\n\n“The radicals on the left are the problem, and they’re vicious and they’re horrible, and they’re politically savvy.”\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said that while he would like to see the country heal, “we’re dealing with a radical left group of lunatics, and they don’t play fair and they never did”.\n\nKirk’s assassination has prompted fears of further violence amid a documented increase in politically motivated attacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a tally by the Reuters news agency, the US experienced at least 300 instances of political violence between the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol and the 2024 presidential election, marking it out as the worst period for such violence since the 1970s.",

      "content": "Fatma Ali and her children find hope after reuniting with husband and father Shamoun Idris amid Sudan’s ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n\nA Sudanese father who had lost contact with his wife for 18 months has been reunited with his family after recognising them in an Al Jazeera news report.\n\nShamoun Idris lived with his wife, Fatma Ali, and their children in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, until the city became a battleground between Sudan’s regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in August 2023, a few months after the war in Sudan started.\n\nAs the war intensified and shelling increased near their home, the couple decided that Fatma would try to escape Khartoum with their children. Shamoun would stay behind and protect the house as RSF forces advanced, looting homes and attacking civilians.\n\n“I decided that they should leave,” Shamoun told Al Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall, who reported on the initial story featuring Fatma and their children. “I stayed behind to guard the house. We thought the war would end soon and they would be able to return.”\n\nBut soon after, and with the violence in the capital increasing, Idris was also forced to flee. In the process, both Shamoun and Fatma lost their phones and were unable to contact each other, with no knowledge of where the other was.\n\nThe couple became two of the 7,700 Sudanese people searching for missing relatives, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n“I kept telling the children he was somewhere, just unable to reach us, but, in fact, I was completely at a loss, and I was wondering what really happened to him. I couldn’t focus on the children or on him being missing,” said Fatma.\n\nReunion\n\nFatma and the children eventually reached Sennar, south of Khartoum, where they sheltered in a school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Shamoun searched for them in vain, until he eventually saw an Al Jazeera news report from February about missing relatives.\n\nIn the report was his wife, Fatma.\n\n“I said, ‘Man, this is my family!’ I said, ‘I swear, it’s my family.’ It was such a huge surprise,” Shamoun said.\n\nAs Fatma listened to her husband tell the story of their recent reunion, she began to cry, overwhelmed with the emotion of Shamoun’s absence.\n\nShe said her hope now is for the family to rebuild their lives. “I hope we can go back and return to our previous life. I knew my children would be OK as long as I was with them, but for their father to be gone, that was a real problem.”\n\n“Our children went to school and were very happy. Not one of our children was out of school; they even went to private schools, not public ones,” she said. “Now, it’s been more than two years since they saw the inside of a classroom, except as somewhere to shelter.”\n\nSince being reunited, Shamound has found a small plot of land in Sennar, where he has built a little shack for the family.\n\nIt has no door to keep out rain, wind or sun, but thousands of other displaced people in Sudan do not have any shelter at all.\n\nFor now, Shamoun and Fatma are grateful for the little privacy and freedom it provides, and for being together.",

      "description": "Indian captain Yadav and his squad did not indulge in the customary post-match handshakes with Pakistan.",
      "content": "Indian captain Yadav and his squad did not indulge in the customary post-match handshakes with Pakistan.\n\nDubai, UAE – The wide-ranging ramifications of an ongoing political standoff between India and Pakistan have led to a controversial conclusion of the archrivals’ cricket match at the Asia Cup 2025 in Dubai, where India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav confirmed that his squad opted against shaking hands with their opponents as a mark of protest.\n\nWhen Sunday’s Group A fixture between the South Asian archrivals was confirmed after long deliberations from the Indian government, fans and experts had hoped that the on-field action could help cool the off-field heat.\n\nYadav, though, crushed all expectations by saying his team’s thumping seven-wicket win in the T20 match was a “perfect reply” to Pakistan in the wake of the intense four-day cross-border conflict that brought both countries to the brink of an all-out war in May.\n\n“Our [Indian] government and the BCCI [Board of Control for Cricket in India] were aligned on the decision to play this match. We came here just to play the match and gave them [Pakistan] a perfect reply,” Yadav told the media shortly after the match.\n\nWhat happened at the end of the India vs Pakistan match?\n\nYadav, who hit the winning runs for India, walked off the field alongside his batting partner, Shivam Dube, without approaching the Pakistani captain and team for the traditional post-match handshakes.\n\nPakistan’s players trudged off in a group and waited for the Indian squad and support staff to come out and shake hands, as is the norm at the end of cricket matches.\n\nHowever, the Indian contingent only shook hands with each other before walking into their dressing room and shutting the door as the waiting Pakistan players looked on.\n\nNo handshakes between the teams. Salman Agha looked to lead Pakistan over to the India dressing room, but nothing doing. They all headed straight in #INDvPAK pic.twitter.com/0BbJtYdkAf — Paul Radley (@PaulRadley) September 14, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did Indian team refuse to shake hands with Pakistani players?\n\nThe Indian captain was asked to clarify his team’s actions and whether they were in contradiction with the spirit of the sport.\n\n“A few things in life are above sportsman’s spirit,” the 35-year-old swiftly responded.\n\n“We stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack and with their families, and dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor.”\n\nYadav was referring to the Indian armed forces’ multiple missile attacks on six locations inside Pakistan.\n\nIndia said the missiles were in response to the April 22 attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in Pahalgam, in which 26 men were killed. An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF), which demands independence for Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the attack, but India had alleged Pakistani involvement.\n\nTwo days later, Pakistan responded to the missile strikes by attacking military installations across its frontier with India and Indian-administered Kashmir, striking at least four facilities.\n\nThe conflict ended four days later, thanks to an internationally-brokered ceasefire.\n\nWhile the exchange of aerial fire came to a halt, the diplomatic ties between the neighbours remained suspended, and the political tension spilled over into cricket when the fixture between India and Pakistan was announced by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).\n\nDid India break any rules by not shaking hands?\n\nAs a result, the match was played under a highly charged political climate, and when both captains did not indulge in the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, the focus swiftly shifted to the interactions between the teams.\n\nHowever, Al Jazeera has learned that the match referee, Andy Pycroft, had asked Yadav and his counterpart, Agha, to skip the pre-toss ritual.\n\n“The match referee requested both captains to not shake hands at the toss,” an official of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), requesting anonymity, told Al Jazeera after the match.\n\nMatch officials also granted India permission to skip the post-match handshakes with Pakistan, but did not inform Agha or his team, according to the source.\n\nThis resulted in an awkward-looking post-match scenario, where the Pakistani players followed Yadav off the pitch and waited for the Indians to emerge, only to watch them shut the dressing room door.\n\nHow did Pakistan respond?\n\nPakistan’s manager Naveed Akram Cheema lodged a protest against the Indian cricket team’s actions with Pycroft, who is an International Cricket Council (ICC) accredited match referee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The umpires had allowed the Indians to walk off the field without shaking hands for which the match referee apologised after the protest of our team manager,” the official said.\n\nAdditionally, Pakistan captain Agha did not speak at the post-match captain’s chat with the host broadcaster in a mark of protest.\n\nMike Hesson, Pakistan’s head coach, confirmed that Agha’s refusal to show up for the talk and the media briefing was a “follow-on effect” of the Indian team’s actions.\n\n“We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game, but our opposition did not do that,” Hesson said.\n\n“We sort of went over there to shake hands, and they had already gone into the changing room.”\n\nWhy are handshakes important in cricket, and what’s the protocol?\n\nAs per the norm in cricket, the two on-field players of the team batting second shake hands with the fielding team and the umpires before walking off.\n\nAnd in what is now a common practice in all international cricket matches, the batting team then enters the ground to shake hands with their opponents.\n\nIt offers both sides to end the match on a friendly note and exchange words of encouragement.\n\nIn the same manner, both teams’ captains shake hands before the toss, which takes place 30 minutes before the start of play.\n\nThe toss is conducted by the match referee on the pitch and usually broadcast live.\n\nBoth captains and the match referee can also indulge in a pre-match chat regarding team lineups or any other matters of mutual interest for both teams.\n\nThe match referee can also meet a captain, head coach or manager of either team before the match.\n\nWhat have the tournament officials said about the incident?\n\nThe move was lamented by the ACC chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the PCB.\n\n“Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today,” Naqvi said in a post on X.\n\n“Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports.”\n\nUtterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. Lets hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace — Mohsin Naqvi (@MohsinnaqviC42) September 14, 2025\n\nAl Jazeera has reached out to the ACC for a comment on the revelation that both captains were asked not to shake hands at the toss.\n\nThe ACC has not yet responded to the request.\n\nPakistan and India are likely to meet again in the Asia Cup if both teams qualify for the Super Four stage.\n\nIndia have all but qualified after two wins in two games, while Pakistan face the UAE in a must-win fixture on Wednesday.\n\nShould both teams win their respective games, their Super Fours match will take place on Sunday in Dubai.",

      "description": "Israel intensifies its bombardment of Gaza City, levelling 16 buildings, including three towers, and killing dozens.",
      "content": "Israeli forces have killed 53 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip and levelled 16 buildings in Gaza City, including three residential towers, as they ramp up an offensive to seize the northern urban centre and displace its population.\n\nAt least 35 of the victims on Sunday were killed in Gaza City, according to medics.\n\nTwo more Palestinians also died of malnutrition in the Strip, according to its Ministry of Health, taking the death toll from hunger to 422 since the beginning of Israel’s war.\n\nIn Gaza City, the Israeli military marked the al-Kawthar tower in the southern Remal neighbourhood as a target, before launching missile strikes that destroyed the building two hours later. The relentless bombardment has forced tens of thousands to flee.\n\n“We don’t know where to go,” said Marwan al-Safi, a displaced Palestinian. “We need a solution to this situation… We are dying here.”\n\nThe Government Media Office in Gaza condemned Israel’s “systematic bombing” of civilian buildings, saying the aim of the offensive was “extermination and forced displacement”.\n\nIn a statement, the office said that while Israel was claiming to be targeting armed groups, “the field realities prove beyond doubt” that Israeli forces were bombing “schools, mosques, hospitals and medical centres”, and destroying towns, residential buildings, tents and headquarters of various groups, including international humanitarian organisations.\n\nThe head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a post on X that 10 of the agency’s buildings have been hit in Gaza City in the past four days alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat includes seven schools and two clinics that were sheltering thousands of displaced people. “No place is safe in Gaza. No one is safe,” he wrote.\n\n‘Nowhere in Gaza is safe’\n\nAs bombardments intensified, families were once again forced to flee south towards al-Mawasi, an area Israel has designated as a “safe zone” despite repeatedly attacking it.\n\nAhmed Awad told Al Jazeera that he had escaped northern Gaza on Saturday as “mortar shells rained down”. He described arriving at midnight to find “no water, no toilets, nothing. Families are sleeping in the open. The situation is extremely dire”.\n\nAnother displaced Palestinian, AbedAllah Aram, said his family faced a “severe shortage” of clean water.\n\n“Food is scarce, and inside these tents, people are hungry and malnourished. Winter is approaching, and we urgently need new tents. On top of that, this area cannot handle more displaced families,” he said.\n\nA third man said he has been unable to find shelter in al-Mawasi despite arriving a week ago. He described his ordeal as unbearable.\n\n“I have a large family, including my children, mother and grandmother. Not only are missiles raining down on us, but famine is devouring us too. My family has been on a constant journey of displacement for two years. We can no longer endure the ongoing genocidal war or hunger,” he said.\n\n“Above all, we have no source of income to feed our starving children. Displacement is as painful as eviscerating one’s soul out of the body.”\n\nUNICEF, meanwhile, said that conditions in al-Mawasi were worsening on a daily basis.\n\n“Nowhere in Gaza is safe, including in this so-called humanitarian zone,” Tess Ingram, the agency’s spokesperson, told Al Jazeera from al-Mawasi. “The camp is becoming more and more crowded by the day.”\n\nShe recalled meeting a woman, Seera, who had been ordered to evacuate Gaza City while pregnant. “She went into labour in Sheikh Radwan and gave birth on the side of the road while trying to find help, whilst evacuation orders were being issued for that area,” Ingram said.\n\n“She is one of so many examples of families who have come here and now are struggling to access the basics they need to survive.”\n\nDoha summit condemns ‘barbaric’ Israel\n\nMeanwhile, the political fallout from Israel’s strike on Hamas negotiators in Qatar last week, which killed five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer, has continued.\n\nIzzat al-Rashq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said the “war criminal Netanyahu is attempting to shift the battle to the region, seeking to redraw the Middle East and dominate it in pursuit of mythical fantasies related to ‘Greater Israel’, which places the entire region on the brink of explosion due to his extremism and recklessness.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the attack on Qatari soil was meant to “destroy the negotiation process and undermine the role of our sister state, Qatar”.\n\nAt a preparatory meeting ahead of a summit on Monday in Doha, Arab and Islamic leaders discussed ways to respond.\n\nReuters reported that a draft resolution seen at the meeting condemned Israel’s “genocide, ethnic cleansing, starvation, siege, and colonising activities”, warning that such actions threatened peace in the region and undermined efforts to normalise ties with Arab states.\n\nQatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani called Israel’s attack on Doha on September 9 “barbaric” and urged fierce and firm measures in response.\n\nSheikh Mohammed said that Arab nations supported “lawful measures” to protect Doha’s sovereignty and called on the international community to abandon “double standards” in dealing with Israel.\n\nArab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said that “silence and inaction” had emboldened Israel to carry out crimes “with impunity”. He called on Arab and Islamic nations to hold Israel accountable for “evidenced war crimes”, including “killing civilians, starving the population and driving an entire population homeless”.\n\nAdnan Hayajneh, a professor of international relations at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera that the regional mood had shifted. “The US has to wake up to the fact that you’ve got 2 billion Muslims around the world insulted, and it’s only the beginning. It’s not only the attack on Qatar, it is a continuation of destabilisation of the whole region,” he said.\n\nUS-Israeli relations\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that ties with the United States remained strong, despite Washington’s unease over the strike in Qatar. Hosting US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said that relations were “as strong and durable as the stones in the Western Wall”.\n\nRubio, before his departure, claimed that US President Donald Trump was “not happy” about the Israeli attack in Doha, but maintained that US-Israeli relations remained “very strong”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said that Washington was trying to manage the fallout.\n\n“The US is surely going to do some damage control, saying that the strikes on Doha are not going to change the relationship with Israel, but some conversations will need to be had,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli ministers have pledged to continue pursuing Hamas leaders abroad. Minister of Energy Eli Cohen declared, “Hamas cannot sleep peacefully anywhere in the world,” including in NATO member state Turkiye.\n\nAnother minister, Ze’ev Elkin, said: “We will pursue them and settle accounts with them, wherever they are.”\n\nIsraeli media later reported that Mossad chief David Barnea had opposed the Qatar strike, fearing it would derail ceasefire negotiations. A columnist in the Israeli newspaper Maariv wrote that Barnea believed Hamas leaders “can be eliminated at any given moment”, but had warned that attacking Doha risked torpedoing a deal to release captives Hamas had taken from Israel during its attack on October 7, 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Israel began its war on Gaza after the Hamas attack, at least 64,871 Palestinians have been killed and 164,610 injured, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry.\n\nSeparately, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Israel’s Ministry of Defence is treating about 20,000 wounded soldiers, with more than half suffering from psychological trauma and estimates suggesting that by 2028, the figure could rise to 50,000.",

      "title": "Chinese EV players take fight to legacy European automakers on their home turf",
      "description": "Chinese electric carmakers Xpeng and GAC this week signalled aggressive expansion plans in Europe.",
      "content": "Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng speaks to reporters at the electric carmaker's stand at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nGermany this week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf. The IAA Mobility conference in Munich was packed full of companies with huge stands showing off their latest cars and technology. Among some of the biggest displays were those from Chinese electric car companies, underscoring their ambitions to expand beyond China. Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. At the same time, Tesla , which was for so long seen as the electric vehicle market leader, has seen sales decline in the region. Despite Chinese EV makers facing tariffs from the European Union, players from the world's second-largest economy have responded to the ramping up of competition by setting aggressive sales and expansion targets. \"The current growth of Xpeng globally is faster than we have expected,\" He Xiaopeng, the CEO of Xpeng told CNBC in an interview this week.\n\nAggressive expansion plans\n\nChinese carmakers who spoke to CNBC at the IAA show signaled their ambitious expansion plans. Xpeng's He said in an interview that the company is looking to launch its mass-market Mona series in Europe next year. In China, Xpeng's Mona cars start at the equivalent of just under $17,000. Bringing this to Europe would add some serious price competition.\n\nwatch now\n\nMeanwhile, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) is targeting rapid growth of its sales in Europe. Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC that the company aims to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year and at least 50,000 units by 2027. GAC also announced plans to bring two EVs — the Aion V and Aion UT — to Europe. Leapmotor was also in attendance with their own stand. There are signs that Chinese players have made early in roads into Europe. The market share of Chinese car brands in Europe nearly doubled in the first half of the year versus the same period in 2024, though it still remains low at just over 5%, according to Jato Dynamics. \"The significant presence of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers at the IAA Mobility, signals their growing ambitions and confidence in the European market,\" Murtuza Ali, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nTech and gadgets in focus\n\nMany of the Chinese car firms have positioned themselves as technology companies, much like Tesla, and their cars highlight that. Many of the electric vehicles have big screens equipped with flashy interfaces and voice assistants. And in a bid to lure buyers, some companies have included additional gadgets. For example, GAC's Aion V sported a refrigerator as well as a massage function as part of the seating.\n\nThe Aion V is one of the cars GAC is launching in Europe as it looks to expand its presence in the region. The Aion V is on display at the company's stand at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich, Germany on September 9, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\n\nThis is one way that the Chinese players sought to differentiate themselves from legacy brands. \"The chances of success for Chinese automakers are strong, especially as they have an edge in terms of affordability, battery technology, and production scale,\" Counterpoint's Ali said.\n\nEurope's carmakers push back\n\nLegacy carmakers sought to flex their own muscles at the IAA with Volskwagen , BMW and Mercedes having among the biggest stands at the show. Mercedes in particular had advertising displayed all across the front entrance of the event. BMW, like the Chinese players, had a big focus on technology by talking up its so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system. BMW, which introduced the iX3 at the event, and chipmaker Qualcomm also announced assisted driving software that the two companies co-developed. Volkswagen and French auto firm Renault also showed off some new electric cars. Regardless of the product blitz, there are still concerns that European companies are not moving fast enough. BMW's new iX3 is based on the electric vehicle platform it first debuted two years ago. Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers have been quick in bringing out and launching newer models. \"A commitment to legacy structures and incrementalism has slowed its ability to build and leverage a robust EV ecosystem, leaving it behind fast moving rivals,\" Tammy Madsen, professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said of BMW. While European autos have a strong brand history and their CEOs acknowledged and welcomed the competition this week in interviews with CNBC, the Chinese are not letting up.\n\nwatch now",

      "description": "From where to sit in restaurants to what to wear in India, Lucy Handley shares stories and tips from her solo trips in Asia, Europe and North America.",
      "content": "From mountain trekking in India to a silent retreat in Bali, I've been fortunate to travel solo multiple times in the past decade. Over the years, I've found that mixing tours with independent travel helps me get the most out of my trips. Meeting people is high on my priority list, as is feeling safe when I travel. Here are some tips to do both.\n\nCover your calves in India\n\nIn the southern state of Kerala, India, I stayed at Soul and Surf, a guesthouse in the town of Varkala that specializes in yoga classes and surfing lessons. While on the resort's grounds on a grassy clifftop, I lazed in a bikini among mainly western tourists. But in the center of the small town, I wore long dresses or pants and made sure to cover my legs and shoulders.\n\nI reveled in waking up solo and being able to choose exactly what I wanted to do each day. Lucy Handley\n\nLocal people dress modestly, and it was important for me to respect that: I also felt that I would be less likely to attract unwanted attention. Kerala has a reputation for being more relaxed than other parts of India but I still covered up. Following local customs is a good way to fit in to any destination.\n\nJoin a tour — but do your own thing too\n\nWhen traveling by myself, I aim for a mix of organized tours and solo explorations. On a trip to Vietnam, I joined a sightseeing tour of the Mekong Delta, a network of rivers and islands in the southern tip of the country. While the tour was undeniably touristy, I got the chance to chat with others and hear their stories. We had evenings to ourselves, and I enjoyed swimming alone at the hotel's pool and eating street food for dinner by myself.\n\nThe author on a tour of an island in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Lucy Handley\n\nAfter the tour, I enjoyed doing my own thing on Phu Quoc, an island in the Gulf of Thailand. I reveled in waking up solo and being able to choose exactly what I wanted to do each day. I mixed tours with solo travel on my trip to Kerala too. After a few days by the beach, I joined an organized trek of the Western Ghats from the hill town of Munnar, hiking through tea plantations, cardamom fields and rainforests, where we had to get off the beaten path so as not to disturb the area's wild elephants.\n\nYoga can take you everywhere\n\nI have attended yoga classes alone in Las Vegas, the Spanish island of Mallorca, and the tourist-friendly state of Goa, India. A retreat at Villa De Zoysa, a family-owned estate in southern Sri Lanka, kickstarted my love of yoga, and it has helped me find community when I travel alone. For those who aren't fans, language and dance classes could work too. While cat-sitting in Mallorca, I joined classes at Bini Balance, run by yoga instructor Cristina Moragues. She invited me to join a retreat in the nearby Serra de Tramuntana mountain range that runs through the center of the island. In Goa, I approached tourists who were walking on Patnem Beach, carrying yoga mats. They invited me to join a class, and we became vacation buddies, going on a boat trip to neighboring beaches and spending the evening at a silent disco together.\n\nSit at the bar when eating out\n\nDining alone can feel exposing, so I often look for restaurants where there are seats at the bar. On a solo trip to New Orleans to see Beyonce perform during her 2023 Renaissance tour, I had brunch at Willa Jean in the city's central business district. I sat at the bar, enjoying avocado toast and a paloma cocktail, while chatting to a private jet company operator and an LVMH executive, who were both in town for business.\n\nSitting at the counter or bar at a restaurant can be a good way to meet other travelers when vacationing alone.

I find trawling endless online reviews for hotel or restaurant recommendations tedious and instead rely on \"Lonely Planet\" or \"Rough Guide\" books. It also feels safer — I'm less likely to have my phone in my hand scrolling on an unfamiliar street. Plus, it means I look up more and can take in more of my surroundings. Guided walking tours are also a great way to explore a city without your nose in your phone. I took a walking tour of Ho Chi Minh City with GuruWalk, which runs on a pay-what-you-can basis.\n\nStay in a hotel with group activities\n\nHotels that offer activities can make for an easy solo trip. Red Mountain Resort in Utah offers packages that include group guided hikes, classes such as Pilates, core fitness and meditation. While there, I found these activities made it easy to meet other travelers.\n\nGuests can go on a kayak or paddleboard \"safari\" to an adjacent bay at Neilson's Beach Club in Sardinia.

Traveling during school terms increases your chances of meeting others who are vacationing alone — and it's cheaper, too. Certain activities attract solo travelers too. In Indonesia, I stayed at Bali Silent Retreat, where most guests were traveling solo. Not speaking for a few days felt liberating. However, if the silence is too much, the retreat offers short trips to a nearby hot spring, where talking is allowed.\n\nSafety tips for solo travel\n\nTraveling by yourself can feel hugely freeing. That said, I do take a few safety precautions. Before I go away, I leave a detailed itinerary with my family, including the phone numbers of tour guides and taxi companies I'm using, along with my travel insurance information. If you're a U.S. citizen, you can register trips abroad with the government's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program so you can be contacted if there is an emergency. There is no similar system in the U.K., but the government publishes a list of English-speaking doctors worldwide. I book most of my transfers, accommodations and tours ahead, though I try to leave some flexibility so I can be spontaneous too. When I'm out and about, I wear a cross-body purse and avoid keeping valuables in my pockets. I always pack a spare credit card and extra cash, which l leave in the hotel's safe. When traveling by train, or rickshaw in India, I wore a money belt under my pants. Locals advised me not to walk alone late at night in New Orleans, and I made sure to book and wait for taxis indoors rather than on the street.\n\nA cross-body purse is useful for valuables while traveling.

      "title": "Is the humanoid robot industry ready for its ChatGPT moment?",
      "description": "AI-powered humanoid robots are being rolled out across different industries, with some in the industry saying widespread adoption is here.",
      "content": "In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nTwo humanoid robots are on display at the China Mobile booth at the Mobile World Conference in Shanghai on June 19, 2025. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nHumanoid robots, which have made significant technological advances this year, may be at the precipice of a ChatGPT-like spike in investment and popularity — or at least, that's what many in the industry believe. So-called humanoid robots are artificial intelligence-powered machines designed to resemble humans in appearance and movement, with expected use cases across the industrial and service sectors. Makers of these robots have been working on the technology in the background for years. Now, they say they're ready to unleash the technology into the world. \"There is a consensus in our industry that the ChatGPT moment for humanoid robots has arrived,\" Xiong Youjun, general manager at the Beijing Innovation Center for Humanoid Robotics, said during a panel in Singapore on Thursday, alongside other professionals from China's robotics industry.\n\n\"This year has been defined as the first year of mass production of humanoid robots,\" Xiong, chief technology officer and executive director of robotics firm UBTech, said in Mandarin translated by CNBC. He added that there had been rapid progress in both the mechanical bodies and the AI-powered \"brains.\" The original \"ChatGPT moment\" occurred in late 2022, when OpenAI released its groundbreaking generative AI chatbot to the public, leading to mass adoption of large language models and widespread recognition of their potential.\n\nTesla's Optimus robot gestures at an unveiling event in Los Angeles, Oct. 10, 2024. Tesla | Via Reuters\n\nRobotics players hoping to recreate that impact include Tesla's Optimus. Meanwhile, a growing number of humanoid robot start-ups are emerging in China, with companies like Unitree, Galbot, Agibot and UBtech Robotics bringing products to market. While humanoid robots are yet to reach a fraction of the adoption seen with generative AI, many experts do expect the technology to have a transformative impact on the global economy in a matter of years. Meanwhile, robots have begun to appear everywhere, from factories to technology conferences and sporting events.\n\nHumanoids pick up steam\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said he expects the company to produce 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, with the technology expected to eventually make up the majority of the EV maker's business. Meanwhile, humanoid robot firms in China say their products are already being used in factories and for commercial services. Speaking on Thursday, Zhao Yuli, chief strategy officer at Galbot, said the start-up had already deployed almost 1,000 robots across different businesses. Other companies, such as UBTech Robotics and Galbot, have also installed robots in local factories, according to local media reports. According to Zhao, these deployments have come alongside a surge of investor interest and government support in the sector, as well as the maturation of both robotics and generative AI technology. Industry experts noted that this maturation in technology has been on display at a number of conferences and events this year, such as China's World Humanoid Robotics Game, which sees robots compete in practical scenarios. Galbot won a gold medal in the Robot Skills event after placing first in a pharmaceutical sorting challenge. Improvements in Chinese humanoid robots' motion control have also been on display in recent months at sporting events such as marathons and boxing matches. Guo Yandong, founder and CEO of AI² Robotics, added that improvements in generative AI have also enabled robots to learn on the job rather than rely solely on preset commands, a shift that could expand the uses of humanoids across sectors.\n\nNot so fast\n\nDespite the hype from humanoid robotics companies, however, many experts resist the idea that mass public adoption will occur anytime soon. \"Humanoids won't arrive all at once in a ChatGPT moment, but slowly enter more and more positions as their capabilities increase,\" said Reyk Knuhtsen, analyst at SemiAnalysis, an independent research and analysis company specializing in semiconductors and AI. He added that their first uses will be in low-stakes, failure-tolerant tasks. That's not to mention long manufacturing timelines and high costs, which will also slow adoption compared to generative AI, he added.\n\nUBTech humanoid robot is on display during the 27th China Beijing International High-tech Expo at China National Convention Center on May 8, 2025 in Beijing, China.

OpenAI seemed to be behind much of the market's rise, suggesting the artificial intelligence narrative is still compelling to investors.

These destinations often top \"bucket lists\" for global travelers, but travelers from Asia-Pacific are planning trips to other destinations in the region, search data from Booking.com this year showed. The data, which analyzes searches from Jan. 1 to June 30, showed travel interest in Asia-Pacific varies by country. However, one country ranked high in 70% of the analyzed territories: Japan. Tokyo topped search lists in the region, yet Osaka also appeared on the top 10 lists for travelers from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.

      "description": "Charlie Kirk's suspected killer Tyler Robinson was caught in a very human way, but he left a novel forensics technology tip behind at the crime scene.",
      "content": "A TV monitor displays a picture of Tyler Robinson, the suspected of killing Charlie Kirk on September 11, in Orem, Utah, on September 12, 2025.\n\nAs the search unfolded for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk's assassin, with the suspect identified on Friday as Tyler Robinson, law enforcement parsed every possible lead. One piece of evidence they homed in on: a forearm print taken from the sniper's position.\n\nBefore Robinson's apprehension Friday morning as a result of very human methods — it has been reported that Robinson offered what may have been a form of confession to family members, who then shared the information, leading to his surrender, though the situation is fluid and more details on the investigation were offered over the weekend — FBI agent Robert Bohls said investigators had collected a \"footwear impression, a palm print and forearm imprints\" from the crime scene for analysis.\n\nForearm imprints are not a commonly collected piece of evidence, according to experts CNBC spoke with.\n\n\"It's very unusual,\" said Patrick McClain, a Texas-based criminal defense attorney and retired Marine Corps military judge. McClain explained that typically, when a forearm print is mentioned, authorities have collected DNA or other skin residue from the surface against which the forearm was pressed.\n\n\"It's merely a mold from an imprint left from remaining in a prone shooting position with forearms on the deck for a period of time,\" said Jeff Wenninger, founder and CEO of Law Enforcement Consultants, who has worked with the LAPD's elite Metropolitan Division and with the Secret Service in protecting dignitaries. \"It would be similar to a shoe or boot print that they lift with a mold,\" he added.\n\nWenninger says that a forearm print can be used to corroborate identification purposes, such as unique characteristics like scarring or the imprint of known clothing worn.\n\n\"Like fingerprints, a forearm print can be unique enough for identification if it's of sufficient quality,\" he said.\n\nIt could also have a forensic value if biological material like sweat, body oils, or touch DNA can be recovered, and along with other evidence, it can corroborate or contradict witness statements or video footage.\n\nNew technology is giving the forearm a wider window into a possible suspect. Physical impressions have been utilized in forensic investigations for years, Wenninger said, but in recent years, the methodologies for identifying and comparing specific meaningful markings have evolved, and the scanning technology for analyzing imprints has improved so much that \"it seems new.\"\n\n3D scanning has revolutionized this science, turning the forearm print into a reservoir of previously untapped information. An imprint alone cannot determine factors such as ethnicity and gender, and investigators would still be reliant on whether DNA or other biological evidence has been obtained from the imprint.\n\n\"It's a newer exploration in forensics, including other skin prints. But it's not like a finger/palm print that is 100% unique,\" said Toby Braun, CEO and Founder of American Special Investigative Group, which specializes in executive protection, threat-intelligence monitoring, and complex investigations.\n\nAccording to Braun, a forearm print won't ID a person from a database like a fingerprint would. \"A forearm print is not considered a primary form of forensic evidence in the same way that a fingerprint is,\" he said.",

      "title": "Can an Amazon AI voice guide you better than customer product reviews? It's starting to try",
      "description": "Amazon shoppers can easily go down the rabbit hole of customer product reviews. Can an AI audio summary replace them all?",
      "content": "Anyone who has ever gone in search of a product review on Amazon knows how valuable the experience of other shoppers can be, and how easy it is to fall down the rabbit hole of customer comments, from five-star raves to one-star takedowns — sometimes hundreds of words to get to the point. As Amazon continues to roll out AI features it says will make shopping easier, AI-generated audio descriptions of products are in the mix and scraping that customer commentary — maybe ultimately settling into a position to replace it as a go-to source of buying information.\n\nCalled \"Hear the Highlights,\" the AI-voiced product descriptions rely on a large language model to script the summary based on a variety of sources, pulling from Amazon's product catalog, customer reviews, and information from across the web, and then translating the content into short-form audio clips. The summaries began rolling out during the summer on select products to a subset of U.S. customers and have now reached all U.S. customers as a button in the mobile shopping app, scaling up to cover over one million products.\n\nA unique appeal of Amazon, and other e-commerce options, has always been the ability to get information from actual users, not just product descriptions. Of course, bogus reviews have long been a problem for Amazon, even though it bans use of paid promotion and other inauthentic forms of review writing. You still have to sort through various efforts to game the system, and in recent years, signs that the newest review writers are chatbots like ChatGPT. But actual people sharing their actual, idiosyncratic experience with a product — customers as a source of information, and informed decision making — have been a key part of the learning process from clothing and shoe sizes to safety and more narrow questions: When purchasing a new toaster, does it do bagels, is the timer setting accurate, how easy is it to clean the crumb tray?\n\nCan AI improve on that? Reviews are by nature unwieldy in the mass individuality, but human readers have proven pretty adept at distilling what they need from the human chaos. In some sense, the brain of the average Amazon review reader is a pretty good large language model, skimming and picking out key words and key information, so an AI will have to do it at least as well as a human would if it's to add to the customer experience as promised.\n\nAI and cognitive overload\n\nAI does have its advantages. For one, it won't experience cognitive overload when facing an electric tea kettle on Amazon with over 32,000 reviews. It can comb through the data, but can it gives us only what we need or want to know? That can still be tricky for AI to get right, and it may be inherently problematic to mix product catalogs, customer reviews, and web information into a single distillation – with the sources of this information each coming with its own set of intentions.\n\n\"It's important to recognize where AI is currently strong, such as in automation and pattern recognition, and where it still falls short, like in judgment-heavy tasks,\" said Ankur Edkie, CEO & co-founder, Murf AI, which creates AI voiceovers. \"A key question is whether there's a way to factor in customer context as an input while generating these summaries,\" he said.\n\nThe value of AI, according to Edkie, is finding the proper problem-capability fit. If that isn't achieved, the sense of gimmickry is likely to sneak in through a door left open for AI fatigue, which he says consumers are likely experiencing by now.\n\nAmazon's Hear the Highlights AI-audio summaries are currently the same for every user.\n\n\"The AI summary needs to capture nuance and context. For example, even a few negative reviews on safety can outweigh many positives on other features,\" Edkie said, adding that if a customer is focused solely on product performance, then summaries that emphasize price might not be relevant.\n\nThe ability to factor in context, and to make the review process more of a dialogue between consumer and machine is likely where the technology is headed – in other words, toward the agentic side of AI, where Amazon is also actively adding to its AI commerce tools, such as Rufus, and a shopping tool called Interests AI, which prompts users to describe an interest \"using your own words,\" and then it generates a curated selection of products. That feature, rolled out in the spring, is separate from the main search bar on Amazon's website.\n\nChat and audio summaries will remain among the ways to engage, but having real-time conversations with an AI voice agent — asking specific questions, clarifying concerns, and getting deeper insights from reviews — is what will shift the experience from one-way delivery to two-way discovery, making it far more personalized, according to Edkie. \"Currently, you can interact with Rufus through text or by using voice input, but Rufus cannot talk back, its responses are text-only,\" he said. \"With voice agents, however, you can have a two-way conversation with a bot that speaks to you,\" he added.",

      "description": "Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of dollars from his NFL paychecks in buzzy tech startups and venture funds.",
      "content": "Saquon Barkley has earned nearly $80 million in NFL salary and bonuses since 2018.\n\nInstead of spending that money lavishly, the Philadelphia Eagles running back has invested millions of it in a variety of venture funds and tech startups, according to a report published by The Profile on September 3.\n\nThose funds and startups reportedly include artificial intelligence firm Anthropic, Elon Musk-owned neurotech company Neuralink, prediction market Polymarket and venture capital fund Founders Fund, which is run by billionaire investor and political activist Peter Thiel.\n\n\"I was just thinking about how I can only play for so long, so I really gotta take advantage, keep investing, and create wealth for me and my family,\" Barkley told The Profile.\n\nDON'T MISS: How to build a standout personal brand—online, in person and at work\n\nAfter Barkley became the No. 2 pick in the 2018 NFL draft, he signed a $31.2 million contract — and, wary of overspending and watching his sudden fortune quickly vanish, vowed to invest while living off his endorsement deals instead.\n\n\"When I declared for the NFL draft and kind of realized where I was going to be drafted, that was something I was like, 'You know what? Kind of want to follow the Marshawn Lynch method. I don't want to touch that. I want to invest it, put it in the right peoples' hands and learn as I continue to make investments. And just live off the endorsement deals,'\" Barkley told ESPN in June 2018.\n\nBarkley has endorsement deals with brands including Nike, Pepsi and Toyota. He earns an estimated $10 million per year from endorsements, sports marketing analyst Bob Dorfman told Front Office Sports in January.\n\nThe NFL star initially parked much of his rookie contract in traditional long-term investments like S&P 500 index funds, The Profile reported. He's also put some of his earnings into real estate, including his recent purchase of a $3.9 million home in Malvern, Pennsylvania.\n\nMore recently, he's embraced some risk — investing in mobile payments app Strike in 2021, and announcing plans to convert all his marketing and endorsement earnings to bitcoin using the app, for example. Since then, the price of bitcoin has more than tripled, \"turning a $10 million income stream into a $35 million asset,\" The Profile noted.\n\nMore broadly, startup investing can be a risky approach to money management: Young companies, even trendy ones with lofty valuations, are never guaranteed to succeed. Barkley has funded more than 10 startups, usually at between $250,000 and $500,000 per startup, The Profile reported — likely only constituting a fraction of his career earnings, so far.\n\nHis shift into startup investing began after he read Thiel's book \"Zero to One,\" and he identifies his targets through word-of-mouth referrals from his business manager Ken Katz's investor network, according to The Profile. Barkley interrogates a company's founder or founders directly before choosing to invest, he told the publication.\n\n\"It's about asking them what they stand for, what their mission is, why they think they'll be successful,\" said Barkley. \"They have to be confident, but arrogance is a turn-off.\"\n\nBarkley, 28, kicked off his 8th NFL season — more than double the length of the average NFL player's career — on September 4. He received some extra motivation to grow his wealth as much as possible during his playing career from a severe injury in 2020, when a torn ACL cause him to miss most of his third NFL season, he told the \"The Best Business Show\" podcast in an episode that aired in July 2021.\n\nThe injury forced Barkley to reflect, he said: Running backs endure a lot of physical contact, and tend to have shorter careers than many other professional athletes. If he wasn't going to play for as long as some other superstar athletes — people like LeBron James or Tom Brady — he needed to embrace financial strategies outside of football \"to create generational wealth\" with his paychecks, he said.\n\n\"When you sit out of football for a whole year, you realize that this game could be taken away from you,\" said Barkley.\n\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

      "description": "More drivers are rolling negative equity into new car loans. Here’s how to minimize the cost as much as possible in this situation, experts say.",
      "content": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty Images\n\nHow drivers end up 'underwater'\n\nTo be sure, it's not unusual to see underwater auto loans. You may already be underwater on your loan from the moment you drive out of the dealer with the new vehicle, as cars are depreciating assets, said Brian Moody, senior staff writer at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. But other choices you make, such as taking on a longer loan term or making a smaller down payment, can exacerbate the issue.\n\nwatch now\n\nStill, lengthening an auto loan's terms is \"the one thing consumers can do to decrease costs,\" said Drury. It has gotten to the point where 84-month auto loans have become \"increasingly common,\" he said. In the second quarter of 2025, 84-month auto loans comprised of 21.6% of new auto loans, up from 19.2% the quarter prior, according to Edmunds data provided to CNBC. To compare, 72-month loans were at 36.1% in the second quarter, down from 38.6% in the same timeframe, according to the data. It isn't a problem to have negative equity when you still own and drive the car, Moody said. It becomes an issue when you need to sell or trade it in. Negative equity can also be problematic if your vehicle is totaled. After an accident, your insurer will typically pay the actual cash value of the car. If that's less than what you owe on your loan, you're responsible for the remaining cost.\n\nHow to buy a new car when you're underwater\n\nKeep your current vehicle if you can, experts say, to avoid having to roll that debt into a new loan or come up with cash to cover it. If you truly need a new car, it's important to do preliminary research before you even walk into a car dealership. If you have negative equity from a prior auto loan, rolling it over to a lower-interest car loan can help you save on borrowing costs, Drury said. First, understand what your credit score is, said Moody. Generally speaking, the higher your score, the better the interest rate and loan terms lenders offer you. \"Knowing your credit score and knowing what interest rate you qualify for is important to know upfront,\" Moody said. Try to get pre-approved for different auto loans across several banks or lenders, said Drury. This helps you get a better gauge of the terms you can qualify for and distinguish the best offers. Once you're ready to buy, the auto dealer might either try to match the deals you have or offer better financing options, he said.",

He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAlongside its new iPhone 17 lineup, Apple casually launched a world’s first last week inside the very dull sounding “Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max.” It’s the first charger to support the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, giving you some of the benefits of a more powerful 60W charger in a compact 40W package.\n\nAVS — which stands for Adjustable Voltage Supply — provides granular voltage options allowing the power source to offer more precise and efficient charging of devices like smartphones and laptops. You can see it listed on the charger specs from Apple Insider’s hands-on.\n\nFor reasons of safety, efficiency, and longevity, the batteries in our phones and laptops do not charge at their maximum possible input for the entirety of the charging cycle. Instead it’s regulated at predefined voltages to slow down charging as the battery fills. With AVS, the power source can provide a very specific voltage that is closer to the ideal needed for the device being charged, speeding up charging in the process.\n\nHowever, unlike a true 60W charger, Apple’s little 40W GaN charger can not maintain that peak 60W rate forever — only 18 minutes as demonstrated by Privaterbok over at the r/UsbCHardware subreddit. That makes it suitable for fast charging a new iPhone 17 but not a MacBook Pro, which is why Apple sells it as a 40W charger “with 60W Max” and not a 60W charger.\n\nIt also means that you’ll likely need Apple’s $39 Dynamic Power Adapter if you want to match Apple’s fast charging claim for the iPhone 17 models (“up to 50 percent in 20 minutes”) or wait for Anker and others to provide a compatible USB PD 3.2 AVS charger of their own.",

      "description": "\"Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.\" That's the very obvious understatement that announced the reopening of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning. On Friday it was discovered that Tyler Robinson, arrested for the alleged killing of Charlie Kirk, had inscribed messages on the casings of several bullets [&#8230;]",
      "content": "“Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.” That’s the very obvious understatement that announced the reopening of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning. On Friday it was discovered that Tyler Robinson, arrested for the alleged killing of Charlie Kirk, had inscribed messages on the casings of several bullets found at the crime scene. One of those read “Hey fascist! Catch!” accompanied by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow, and three down arrows, a reference to the code to call down the 500KG Bomb stratagem in the cooperative shooter Helldivers 2.\n\nUnsurprisingly, within minutes the official subreddit and Discord servers were thrown into chaos. Moderators quickly locked the Helldivers subreddit, pointing to a high number of posts that violated its rule against “Real-World Political Discussions.” Similarly, references to Robinson, Kirk, or the 500KG Bomb stratagem were quickly deleted on the Discord server, and some users speculated the code had been flagged for autodeletion. (Arrowhead Game Studios, makers of the Helldivers series, hasn’t released a public statement about the incident and didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Users merely asking why the subreddit was locked were shut down — “We are not allowed to discuss, I would suggest looking elsewhere,” one user was told.\n\nOnline and in conversations with The Verge, Helldivers fans mostly seemed confused and a little concerned about what might come along with all of this sudden attention. “I just don’t want to see a community I love get slandered to no fault of their own,” one Discord user, Inferionix, wrote.\n\nHelldivers is hardly the first piece of media tied to an act of violence; the Columbine High School shooting famously put an unwelcome spotlight on Doom as commentators searched for a meaning behind the attack. But Kirk’s slaying inspired widespread calls for retaliatory violence by Republicans, making the still-ongoing search for Robinson’s motive particularly high-stakes. Even discussing it is risky, as lawmakers and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk are surveilling social media to police social media users’ responses to Kirk’s death, demanding firings at employers including Microsoft. The subreddit mods said in their reopening post that nobody was banned during the initial flood of shooting-related comments, but anyone who discusses it in the future will be.\n\nOne brief bastion where fans of the game could share their feelings was the Helldivers 2 subreddit, which doesn’t have the same strict ban on real life political discussions. A megathread there, at least for a while, was filled mostly was fans marveling at just how surreal the situation was. “Waking up and hearing a sitting governor of the United States say ‘Notices bulge OwO whats this?’ was a goddamn flashbang,” Reddit user Snaxwheels wrote, referring to one of the other, non-Helldivers-related inscriptions. But eventually that thread was also removed after moderators felt it had gotten out of hand.\n\nSome posters there expressed concern that the attention could reignite the culture war around violent video games. One even pointed out that RFK Jr. had recently revived a largely dismissed theory linking violent games to school shootings. Isadora, an active community member who spoke with The Verge, was more dubious. “Givin [sic] the short news cycles and the fact that such a large portion of MAGAs youth base are among the [conservative games streamer] Asmongold/gamergate type I don’t see the admin and its media machine coming super hard against the game itself.”\n\nOne outstanding question is what — if anything — Robinson thought about Helldiver’s politics. The series, which draws from Robert Heinlein’s Starship Troopers and Paul Verhoeven’s film adaptation, is a satire where players take the role of brainwashed military grunts fighting to spread “managed democracy” for a quasi-fascist Super Earth government. Isadora calls the gameplay the biggest draw, but “its politics is what made me fall in love with it,” they said. “I’m a big Paul Verhoeven fan and Starship Troopers was one of my favorites.”\n\nAs with other satires on authoritarianism, like Warhammer 40K, there’s a persistent discussion about whether some players get the joke. Isadora, largely, thinks they do. “I’m sad that this community has been drug into this as I think the game’s ironic criticism of fascism is a great outlet for so many people,” they told The Verge. “It reflects negatively on a community that largely understands the criticisms it lays out.”\n\nHelldivers will almost certainly go down as a footnote in Kirk’s death. But for some players, the strangeness of using the 500KG Bomb combo — or having it as a tattoo — might linger. One Redditor suggested starting a petition to encourage Arrowhead to change the button command. Most disagreed, littering his message with thumbs down and big red X reactions. “Please don’t bring it here,” said the only reply.",

      "content": "We only just put Apple’s iPhone 17 launch event behind us, but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is already glancing into his crystal ball to see what’s next for the company. In today’s Power On newsletter Gurman says that there are at least 10 more products from Apple that are expected to launch either later this year or in the first half of 2026.\n\nSome of those products have been rumored for some time, or are just kind of obvious upgrades. The M5 iPad Pro, for instance, is a matter of when not if. Though the rumors that it will have a second front facing camera for those that prefer to use their iPad in portrait mode is interesting. The iPad Pro could be the first Apple product with an M5 as it’s expected to launch in October, with upgraded MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to follow in early 2026.\n\nGurman also claims that a budget-friendly iPhone 17e is in the works for early next year. Upgrades over the 16e are expected to be pretty minor, with most of the handset remaining the same, but moving to the new A19 chip inside the iPhone 17 line. The Apple TV and HomePod mini are also expected to get updates next year with processor bumps along with support for the new version of Siri and Apple Intelligence features. Same with the Vision Pro, which is expected to get an M4 processor and an improved headband, but otherwise remain largely unchanged while a larger update is in the works for 2027.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing on the list is the long-rumored smart home hub code-named J490. Early chatter suggested that the smart display would launch this past March but, clearly, the device never materialized. Now Gurman claims it should launch in the spring. It would mark the first new major product category for Apple in a while, but one that it’s largely laid the groundwork for between the HomePod and iPad.\n\nRounding out the rumors are AirTag 2 and a pair of new monitors. Updated AirTags will have better range thanks to a new wireless chip. Less is known about the monitors, but the code-names of J427 and J527 suggest we could be looking at a pair of 27-inch displays. The Pro Display XDR and Studio display are both getting on in years, with the Pro having been released at the tail end of 2019.",

Today, Seagate announced an updated version of the LaCie Rugged Mini SSD with a few small design tweaks and a big boost to transfer speeds.\n\nThe drive is now called the LaCie Rugged SSD4 and is available starting today in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities (Seagate is dropping the 500MB option) for $134.99, $249.99, and $479.99, respectively.\n\nThe new Rugged SSD4 introduces a few small design tweaks including a brushed aluminum finish. Image: Seagate\n\nThe Rugged SSD4 is exactly the same size as its predecessor but now features a brushed aluminum finish and a centered USB-C port. It now supports transfer speeds up to 40Gbps with 4,000MB/s read speeds and 3,000MB/s write speeds. Seagate’s older Rugged Mini SSD had a USB-C port that was slightly off-center, a smoother aluminum finish, and read speeds that maxed out at 2,000MB/s.\n\nThe new drive isn’t quite as fast as the LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5 that was introduced earlier this year at CES with 6,700MB/s read and 5,300MB/s write speeds, but when it’s connected to a USB-C iPhone, the Rugged SSD4 is fast enough to capture ProRes 4K footage at 120fps.\n\nAs with the previous version, the new Rugged SSD4 has an IP54 rating against dust and water, but it’s definitely not waterproof so while splashes are okay, a complete dunking would not be.

      "content": "Well, I was wrong, and I did manage to make it to one last day at the Toronto International Film Festival. One of the movies I wanted to see the most this year was Scarlet, the latest from Mamoru Hosoda, whose most recent film was the metaverse fairy tale Belle. Whereas that film was a reimagining of Beauty and the Beast, Scarlet is a twist on Hamlet that’s full of bold, creative ideas. I mostly enjoyed it, but unfortunately it’s saddled with an ending that doesn’t really fit.\n\nI also managed to squeeze in two other films: a Korean revenge / heist thriller, and a Norwegian film about connecting through art. You can read my thoughts on all three below.\n\nThat’s a lot to squeeze into one festival, and I appreciate everyone who followed along. Now I’m gonna take a nap.\n\nProject Y\n\nEven though the opening makes it clear everything turns out relatively OK, Project Y remains riveting and unpredictable throughout. It starts out as a heist movie. Two best friends (Han So-hee and Jun Jong-seo) have worked hard for years and are about to retire from their awful jobs for good, but then they run into a sequence of scams that completely wipe out their savings. So when they hear about a hidden cache of cash, they can’t resist. They get caught, of course, and the film shifts into revenge mode. There are a few implausible moments along the way, but Project Y has an unrelenting kind of tension that’s strengthened by an absolutely vicious villain (Kim Sung-cheol). Just be warned: there are some very gruesome torture sequences.\n\nNo word yet on a wider theatrical release.\n\nScarlet\n\nScarlet (Mana Ashida) is a young princess in 16th century Denmark who finds her life turned upside down when her uncle kills her father to take the crown for himself. The set-up is basically Hamlet, but the twist is that much of the film takes place in the afterlife. It’s a space known as the “otherworld” — neither heaven nor hell, but instead a wasteland where people struggle to get by, and a massive, ancient dragon prowls the skies smiting people with bolts of lightning. The fantasy element of the film is strong, as is Scarlet’s single-minded quest for revenge. But the film unravels towards the end, with a happy ending that feels very out of place.\n\nIn theaters in Japan on November 21st; no word yet on a global theatrical release.\n\nSentimental Value\n\nSisters Nora (Renate Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas) try to come to grips with a troubled childhood after their mostly absentee father Gustav (Stellan Skarsgard) reenters their lives following their mother’s death. It’s an understated but powerful film from Worst Person in the World director Joachim Trier, and it happens in part through understanding trauma through art, as Gustav is a legendary film director attempting to make his most personal movie yet. Sentimental Value is filled with gut punch moments like when Nora asks her sibling “why didn’t our childhood ruin you?” But it brings it all together in a way that feels genuinely hopeful and touching.\n\nIn theaters on November 7th.",

I eventually beat him, but my reward wasn’t a new ability, item, or a bench where I could rest and save my progress. All I got was pain, suffering, and death. In Silksong, the only way out is through, but the “through” is a tunnel lined with spikes that occasionally spew gouts of flame.\n\nI should have given up right then and there, but I have not abandoned Silksong the same way I do other unfun games. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t just put Silksong down and chalk it up as another “not for me” game the way Hollow Knight just wasn’t for me. I enjoy Metroidvanias a great deal — Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was one of my favorite games of last year. And for Silksong, I wanted to try Team Cherry’s work again and see if it would finally click. It has, and it’s because of the community (and a lot of spite).\n\nI came to Hollow Knight late, long after the buzz about it had left my social media circle. With Silksong, I’m playing it at the same time as everyone else. My social media feed is full of people who love the game much more than I do, posting tips, commiserating about its moments of bullshit (hello, lantern fruit pogo platforming), and gushing over the adorable Sherma.\n\n“I have only known Sherma for a day and a half…”\n\nWhen I post lamenting the game’s bullshit, I get excited messages from my friends giving me advice on what I should do next. It’s like we’re all doing our own personal let’s plays together while being in each other’s chats. It feels good. I am not alone in my misery, and better yet, I’ve got friends to help. For Silksong it’s worked in such a way that’s kept me playing longer than I would have if I were going this alone.\n\nThis kind of collective, collaborative gaming experience has also taught me a new trick: taking a break. I’ve never been the kind of gamer that stops playing when I can’t overcome an obstacle. I either do something else in the game or keep running at my problem until I figure it out. Now, when I feel myself getting even the slightest bit mad because I was so close (or I thought I was so close) to surmounting a challenge, I turn off the game and come back later. It’s so silly that, once again, the “touch grass” people are right, but the strategy has gotten me through some of the game’s most egregious moments. (If the vendor Shakra wants to leave her post in Greymoor because of something I did, that’s fine. But taking her bench with her that’s in a room right before a brutal combat gauntlet is a unique and dastardly flavor of Silksong bullshit.)\n\nYou see this fight? Bullshit. Image: Team Cherry\n\nAnd when I overcome that bullshit, I get this incredible frisson of thrill. When I easily beat a boss in fewer tries than I’m used to, I feel godly. I’m actually quite tickled to hear Team Cherry is working to nerf some of the early bosses, because those were fine. (It’s the damn pogo platforming!)\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m going to finish Silksong and whatever I feel at the end of that journey will be more like relief than joy. Silksong has shown me I don’t need to feel “happiness” or “joy” to continue playing a game. I just want to feel something — even if that something is pure spite.",

      "content": "This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on phones and other tech outside the US, follow Dominic Preston. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.\n\nHow it started\n\nSmartphone batteries are bigger than ever, while the phones themselves are shrinking. But whether you’re seeing the benefit — thin phones with big batteries — depends on where you live.\n\nThe key is the introduction of silicon-carbon batteries, which make it possible to fit more battery capacity into the same size cell, as in phones like the Honor Power, whose 8,000mAh battery delivers more power than some iPads. The flip side of that is putting the same capacity into much smaller cells, seen in the likes of the Oppo Find N5, a foldable phone that’s as extraordinarily thin as Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 but has a 5,600mAh battery that wouldn’t be out of place in an Ultra-sized flagship.\n\nHonor and Oppo aren’t the only companies on board. Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo, OnePlus, Nothing, and more have all released phones using silicon-carbon batteries. It’s not just phones, either; Whoop wearables have used silicon-carbon batteries since 2021 thanks to a partnership with Sila Nanotechnologies, and EV manufacturers from General Motors to Porsche have invested heavily in the technology.\n\nBut you’ve probably noticed some pretty big names missing from that list — none of Apple, Samsung, and Google, the three major players in the US phone market, have embraced the new batteries yet. That’s despite the fact that between Samsung and Google’s foldable phones, and super-slim models like the newly announced iPhone Air, the possible applications are immediately obvious.\n\nHow it’s going\n\n“Silcon-carbon batteries” is arguably a bit of a misnomer, because these don’t replace lithium batteries — they’re a subset of them. In the broadest strokes, the bulk of a battery is made up of two parts, the cathode and the anode, and it’s the movement of ions between the two that either charges or discharges the cell.\n\nIn most modern batteries, the cathode is lithium-based, while the anode uses graphite. It’s that bit that silicon-carbon batteries change, using a blend of silicon and graphite for the anode. Silicon has almost 10 times the energy density of graphite, so just a little goes a long way — Honor’s recent Magic V5 foldable is the first to replace 15 percent of the graphite with silicon, and other phones have used as little as 5 percent.\n\nMore silicon means better battery capacity in the same space, so the race is on to push those numbers up. The reason manufacturers can’t go all in and swap all the graphite for silicon is that its energy density comes with one big downside: longevity.\n\nWhen graphite anodes absorb lithium ions during charging, they expand just a little. When silicon anodes absorb those same ions, they expand quite a lot more. Over time, those repeated expansions and contractions damage the battery’s structure, contributing to the decline in battery life you’ll be familiar with if you’ve ever hung onto the same phone for more than a few years. That anode expansion isn’t the same as the swelling that causes batteries to burst out of phones’ bodies, but is one of a few factors that can contribute to it. Simply put: silicon anodes allow for batteries that are much denser, but don’t last as long. And we don’t have a lot of real-world evidence for how bad this problem really is, since the first phone with a silicon-carbon battery, the Honor Magic 5 Pro, only launched in 2023.\n\nThat might be one reason why we haven’t seen Apple, Samsung, and Google jump on board. All three make long-term product support one of their selling points, so switching to batteries that might die off early wouldn’t be a great look. Then there are EU regulations, which now require smartphone batteries to retain 80 percent of their capacity after 800 charging cycles. Silicon battery manufacturer Group14 says its batteries meet that threshold, but it’s still an area where tech giants are likely to be cautious.\n\nThere are also question marks around how big they want their batteries to get anyway. International shipping regulations add stringent requirements — and “dangerous goods” labels — for battery cells larger than 20Wh, which at a standard voltage of 3.7W equates to around 5,400mAh. Batteries bigger than that cost more to ship, especially by air, which is a good incentive to stay just below that line. Even the larger Chinese OEMs are limited by this — the Nothing Phone 3 includes a huge 5,500mAh battery if you buy it in India, but the European version has a 5,150mAh cell instead — below the line where shipping charges go up. This is just one of countless examples of a regional split in battery sizes, with OnePlus even admitting to Android Authority that rules around shipping were to blame for its Nord CE4 Lite bringing a smaller battery to Europe.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWith silicon-carbon batteries first introduced into phones two years ago, we’re reaching the point where manufacturers can get a sense of the real-world longevity of the power cells. If there are problems, they might rein themselves in a little, but if not you should expect things to get more extreme from here.\n\nExpect silicon percentages to push up, next to 20 percent and then beyond, until whenever the diminishing returns kick in. That will mean bigger and bigger batteries in “regular” phones — Oppo has confirmed that its next flagship, the Find X9 Pro, will offer a 7,500mAh battery in China, and it’s been rumored that the Honor Power 2 will go even further, with a battery as big as 10,000mAh, twice the size of some power banks. At the other end of the spectrum, dupes of the iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge are surely on the way, and will no doubt tout bigger batteries than either while staying just as thin.\n\nThe real question is if, and when, Apple, Google, and Samsung will jump on board. While one strand of silicon-carbon battery development is pushing for higher proportions of silicon, others are experimenting with ways to reduce the downsides. I expect this is what these three have their eye on, waiting to be sure that the compromises are minimal, just as they have with their slow adoption of faster charging speeds. Expect Samsung in particular to be cautious — it’s spent the last nine years fearing a repeat of its exploding Note 7 debacle, and is in no rush to risk one, telling T3 that while it’s researching silicon batteries, it places “a little more priority on the reliability.”\n\nBy the way\n\nDon’t mistake silicon-carbon for silicon carbide, a compound material that’s also popping up in tech right now, everywhere from EV semiconductors to the lenses in Meta’s AR glasses\n\nYes, we’ve been getting phones with comically large batteries in them for years, but they used to look like bricks . Imagine the capacity Energizer could put in a novelty phone now!\n\nIf the aim is thinner phones, silicon-carbon will only get us so far — the latest foldable phones are already as thin as the USB-C port, so that’s got to go if we want to really push the limits.\n\nRead this",

Welcome to Installer No. 97, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, hope you’re having a good iPhone / back to school / it’s-finally-not-hot-anymore week, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)\n\nIt’s so good to be back! Huge, huge thanks to Jay Peters for doing such a fabulous job here over the last couple of months, and huge thanks to all of you as always for having such good contributions and ideas. Jay will still be around these parts from time to time, too, so don’t worry, your esoteric gaming recommendations aren’t going anywhere.\n\nI also have for you the best things that Apple launched this week, a new way to watch everyone’s favorite game show, a Stephen King movie worth seeing, and much more. We’re so back, y’all. Let’s do this.\n\n(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you watching / reading / playing / downloading / getting out for the fall this week? Tell me everything: [email protected]. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)\n\nThe Drop\n\nScreen share\n\nYou could probably ascribe a large part of my personality to a specific era of the website Lifehacker. Back in the day, it was this breezy, fun, curious, and self-aware blog about how to use technology and explore the internet and just be a person in the future. And for a long time, it was all coming out of the brain of Gina Trapani, one of the internet’s great bloggers.\n\nGina’s been up to lots of stuff in recent years, but now she’s blogging again! Her site, Note to Self, was an instant subscribe for me — and if you like Installer, then I suspect you’ll like it, too. When I saw the site launch, I reached out to Gina to see how a true lifehacker does a homescreen in 2025.\n\nHere’s Gina’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: Right now, I’ve got a four-year-old iPhone 13 Pro, which means I’m looking forward to upgrading this year. Once you get three to four years of mileage out of your phone, when you do finally trade up, the latest model feels absolutely heavenly, and I appreciate it more.\n\nThe wallpaper: This is Apple’s 2025 Pride wallpaper, which I grabbed in June and haven’t updated since. I like what Apple did with the Pride designs this year — they managed to make something fresh but recognizable.\n\nThe apps: Camera, Settings.\n\nPeople who know me from Lifehacker will expect me to have a tricked-out setup with all the hot new apps, and I’m here to disappoint. I’ve been in touch-grass mode for a while; I want my preteen to see more of me than the top of my head while I look down at my phone. So my homescreen is minimal and utilitarian.\n\nI’ve turned off almost all those horrendous red badges; I feel conflicted about using AI instead of my brain. I keep a small number of my most frequently used apps on my homescreen, and almost all of them are grouped into purpose-related folders, like Communication, Health & Fitness, Travel. That adds another tap to get to them, but the extra step helps me be intentional about what I set out to do. For everything else, I pull down the search bar to find it.\n\nI’m a big note-taker, and I use Obsidian, so I have an iOS shortcut called “Note.” It’s a direct link to an Obsidian note called “Inbox,” where I capture stuff to process later.\n\nIn Health & Fitness, I’ve got a triathlon training app I vibe-coded on Lovable, driven by a personal Google Sheet. All it does is tell me one thing: whether I’m supposed to run, bike, or swim at the gym that day.\n\nAs it turns out, I’m nearly five decades old and need a teeth-brushing coach. The Oral-B app paired with my electric toothbrush gamifies things, which works for me. It helps me get pressure and coverage right, and my full two minutes of brushing in because I won’t otherwise.\n\nSuperhuman is better than Gmail. Todoist is for deadlines. Citymapper is my favorite way to navigate New York City. Monarch is my where-does-the-money-go app. Checking ebooks out of the library with Libby brings me much joy.\n\nI also asked Gina to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email [email protected] or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For more great recommendations, check out this post on Threads, this post on Bluesky, and this post on The Verge.\n\n“I ‘inherited’ my daughter’s Nintendo Switch and got Demon Slayer: The Hinomaki Chronicles on sale for $20. Getting myself hyped up for the movie this weekend.” – Michael\n\n“Stephen Robles on YouTube has created an amazing iOS shortcut that can help protect your iPhone if it’s ever stolen. It sends you the location of your device along with photos from both the front and back cameras. It even plays an audible alert that says, ‘This iPhone is stolen!’ Best of all, you can activate it from any phone, whether Android or iOS.” — Owen\n\n“I just started Frieren and man, the hype is warranted. I’m more of a rom-com, slice of life guy rather than fantasy, but the story is super compelling so far.” — Ryan\n\n“I have been thoroughly enjoying Bill McKibben’s Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization. Its thesis — that the astoundingly rapid buildout of solar and wind could provide us a lifeline out of the worst effects of climate change, if we act now — has brought more hope and enthusiasm about the future than I’ve felt in what feels like years.” — Hoto\n\n“Currently checking out the beta of 2XKO, a free 2v2 tag-team fighting game set in the League of Legends universe. Appears to be great for newcomers.” — Daniel\n\n“I’m cautiously enjoying a new feature on the Garmin Forerunner 955. A recent software update ties in my travel plans to the watch, and I get recommendations for time zone adjustments. It gave decent suggestions when I went from the US to Italy, back to the US, then to France all within a week. The gentle reminders of when to stop caffeine were the best.” — Sean\n\n“I binged and loved Long Story Short by the creator(s) of BoJack Horseman.” — Tal\n\n“1001 Albums Generator recommends a new album every day (including weekends if you like) from the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It’s a great way to listen to some of the best-regarded music and expand your listening habits beyond your music recommendation algorithm.” — Richard\n\n“Alien: Earth. Let’s talk about the octopus eye.” — Sheila\n\nSigning off\n\nOkay, so there is one show I watched this summer that I want to talk about, just for a second. It’s a Netflix show called Building the Band, and it is essentially American Idol meets Love is Blind meets The Circle. The premise makes no sense! It also totally works. I found myself shockingly invested in all these singers and bands, and the whole thing is structured so that none of the 10 episodes ever feel repetitive or draggy. I would watch a thousand seasons of this show — and knowing Netflix, I assume that’s exactly what we’re going to get. And not to brag, but I called the winner with about four episodes to spare.\n\nSee you next week!",

I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there’s a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.”\n\nSpecifically, Taylor compared today’s AI landscape to the dot-com bubble of the late ‘90s.

      "content": "Carla Rover once spent 30 minutes sobbing after having to restart a project she vibe coded.\n\nRover has been in the industry for 15 years, mainly working as a web developer. She’s now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces.\n\nShe called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be “worse than babysitting,” she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.\n\nShe had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools.\n\n“Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review,” she said. “When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more. And I learned my lesson.”\n\nShe and her son wound up restarting their whole project — hence the tears. “I handed it off like the copilot was an employee,” she said. “It isn’t.”\n\nRover is like many experienced programmers turning to AI for coding help. But such programmers are also finding themselves acting like AI babysitters — rewriting and fact-checking the code the AI spits out.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nA recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly found that at least 95% of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers.\n\nThese experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.\n\nWorking with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it’s given rise to a new corporate coding job known as “vibe code cleanup specialist.”\n\nTechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go.\n\n“Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, ‘Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,’” Rover said.\n\nCan they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren’t going to tell you. “It doesn’t make the kid less clever,” she continued. “It just means you can’t delegate [a task] like that completely.”\n\n“You’re absolutely right!”\n\nFeridoon Malekzadeh also compared vibe coding to a child.\n\nHe’s worked in the industry for more than 20 years, holding various roles in product development, software, and design. He’s building his own startup and heavily using vibe-coding platform Lovable, he said. For fun, he also vibe codes apps like one that generates Gen Alpha slang for Boomers.\n\nHe likes that he’s able to work alone on projects, saving time and money, but agrees that vibe coding is not like hiring an intern or a junior coder. Instead, vibe coding is akin to “hiring your stubborn, insolent teenager to help you do something,” he told TechCrunch.\n\n“You have to ask them 15 times to do something,” he said. “In the end, they do some of what you asked, some stuff you didn’t ask for, and they break a bunch of things along the way.”\n\nMalekzadeh estimates he spends around 50% of his time writing requirements, 10% to 20% of his time on vibe coding, and 30% to 40% of his time on vibe fixing — remedying the bugs and “unnecessary script” created by AI-written code.\n\nHe also doesn’t think vibe coding is the best at systems thinking — the process of seeing how a complex problem could impact an overall result. AI-generated code, he said, tries to solve more surface-level problems.\n\n“If you’re creating a feature that should be broadly available in your product, a good engineer would create that once and make it available everywhere that it’s needed,” Malekzadeh said. “Vibe coding will create something five different times, five different ways, if it’s needed in five different places. It leads to a lot of confusion, not only for the user, but for the model.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rover finds that AI “runs into a wall” when data conflicts with what it was hard-coded to do. “It can offer misleading advice, leave out key elements that are vital, or insert itself into a thought pathway you’re developing,” she said.\n\nShe also found that rather than admit to making errors, it will manufacture results.\n\nShe shared another example with TechCrunch, where she questioned the results an AI model initially gave her. The model started to give a detailed explanation pretending it used the data she uploaded. Only when she called it out did the AI model confess.\n\n“It freaked me out because it sounded like a toxic co-worker,” she said.\n\nOn top of this, there are the security concerns.\n\nAustin Spires is the senior director of developer enablement at Fastly and has been coding since the early 2000s.\n\nHe’s found through his own experience — along with chatting with customers — that vibe code likes to build what is quick rather than what is “right.” This may introduce vulnerabilities to the code of the kind that very new programmers tend to make, he said.\n\n“What often happens is the engineer needs to review the code, correct the agent, and tell the agent that they made a mistake,” Spires told TechCrunch. “This pattern is why we’ve seen the trope of ‘you’re absolutely right’ appear over social media.”\n\nHe’s referring to how AI models, like Anthropic Claude, tend to respond “you’re absolutely right” when called out on their mistakes.\n\nMike Arrowsmith, the chief technology officer at the IT management software company NinjaOne, has been in software engineering and security for around 20 years. He said that vibe coding is creating a new generation of IT and security blind spots to which young startups in particular are susceptible.\n\n“Vibe coding often bypasses the rigorous review processes that are foundational to traditional coding and crucial to catching vulnerabilities,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nNinjaOne, he said, counters this by encouraging “safe vibe coding,” where approved AI tools have access controls, along with mandatory peer review and, of course, security scanning.\n\nThe new normal\n\nWhile nearly everyone we spoke to agrees that AI-generated code and vibe-coding platforms are useful in many situations — like mocking up ideas — they all agree that human review is essential before building a business on it.\n\n“That cocktail napkin is not a business model,” Rover said. “You have to balance the ease with insight.”\n\nBut for all the lamenting on its errors, vibe coding has changed the present and the future of the job.\n\nRover said vibe coding helped her tremendously in crafting a better user interface. Malekzadeh simply said that, despite the time he spends fixing code, he still gets more done with AI coders than without them.\n\n“‘Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress,” Malekzadeh said, quoting the French theorist Paul Virilio, who spoke about inventing the shipwreck along with the ship.\n\nThe pros far outweigh the cons.\n\nThe Fastly survey found that senior developers were twice as likely to put AI-generated code into production compared to junior developers, saying that the technology helped them work faster.\n\nVibe coding is also part of Spires’ coding routine. He uses AI coding agents on several platforms for both front-end and back-end personal projects. He called the technology a mixed experience but said it’s good in helping with prototyping, building out boilerplate, or scaffolding out a test; it removes menial tasks so that engineers can focus on building, shipping, and scaling products.\n\nIt seems the extra hours spent combing through the vibe weeds will simply become a tolerated tax on using the innovation.\n\nElvis Kimara, a young engineer, is learning that now. He just graduated with a master’s in AI and is building an AI-powered marketplace.\n\nLike many coders, he said vibe coding has made his job harder and has often found vibe coding a joyless experience.\n\n“There’s no more dopamine from solving a problem by myself. The AI just figures it out,” he said. At one of his last jobs, he said senior developers didn’t look to help young coders as much — some not understanding new vibe-coding models, while others delegated mentorship tasks to said AI models.\n\nBut, he said, “the pros far outweigh the cons,” and he’s prepared to pay the innovation tax.\n\n“We won’t just be writing code; we’ll be guiding AI systems, taking accountability when things break, and acting more like consultants to machines,” Kimara said of the new normal for which he’s preparing.\n\n“Even as I grow into a senior role, I’ll keep using it,” he continued. “It’s been a real accelerator for me. I make sure I review every line of AI-generated code so I learn even faster from it.”",

      "content": "In Brief\n\nAI-powered chatbots play a growing role in spiritual life, according to a New York Times story that examines the popularity of religious chatbots and apps.\n\nThe Times notes that an app called Bible Chat has been downloaded more than 30 million times, while another app, Hallow, reached the number one spot in Apple’s App Store last year.\n\nFor the most part, these apps are supposed to point people to religious doctrine and scripture to answer their questions, although at least one website purports to allow users to chat with God. Rabbi Jonathan Roman suggested chatbots could be a “way into faith” for “a whole generation of people who have never been to a church or synagogue.”\n\nHowever, these chatbots are built on top of AI models that are designed to validate users’ opinions, to the point that they can reinforce delusional or conspiratorial thinking. Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M professor who studies the intersection of digital culture and religion, warned that chatbots “tell us what we want to hear.”\n\n“It’s not using spiritual discernment, it is using data and patterns,” Campbell said.",

For today’s AI empire, it’s artificial general intelligence to “benefit all humanity.” And OpenAI is its chief evangelist, spreading zeal across the industry in a way that has reframed how AI is built.\n\n“I was interviewing people whose voices were shaking from the fervor of their beliefs in AGI,” Karen Hao, journalist and bestselling author of “Empire of AI,” told TechCrunch on a recent episode of Equity.\n\nIn her book, Hao likens the AI industry in general, and OpenAI in particular, to an empire.\n\n“The only way to really understand the scope and scale of OpenAI’s behavior…is actually to recognize that they’ve already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation state in the world, and they’ve consolidated an extraordinary amount of not just economic power, but also political power,” Hao said. “They’re terraforming the Earth. They’re rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives. And so you can only describe it as an empire.”\n\nOpenAI has described AGI as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work,” one that will somehow “elevate humanity by increasing abundance, turbocharging the economy, and aiding in the discovery of new scientific knowledge that changes the limits of possibility.”\n\nThese nebulous promises have fueled the industry’s exponential growth — its massive resource demands, oceans of scraped data, strained energy grids, and willingness to release untested systems into the world. All in service of a future that many experts say may never arrive.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Last week, OpenAI said it expects to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029. Meta said in July that it would spend up to $72 billion on building AI infrastructure this year. Google expects to hit up to $85 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, most of which will be spent on expanding AI and cloud infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, the goal posts keep moving, and the loftiest “benefits to humanity” haven’t yet materialized, even as the harms mount. Harms like job loss, concentration of wealth, and AI chatbots that fuel delusions and psychosis. In her book, Hao also documents workers in developing countries like Kenya and Venezuela who were exposed to disturbing content, including child sexual abuse material, and were paid very low wages — around $1 to $2 an hour — in roles like content moderation and data labeling.\n\nHao said it’s a false tradeoff to pit AI progress against present harms, especially when other forms of AI offer real benefits.\n\nShe pointed to Google DeepMind’s Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold, which is trained on amino acid sequence data and complex protein folding structures, and can now accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acids — profoundly useful for drug discovery and understanding disease.\n\n“Those are the types of AI systems that we need,” Hao said. “AlphaFold does not create mental health crises in people. AlphaFold does not lead to colossal environmental harms … because it’s trained on substantially less infrastructure. It does not create content moderation harms because [the datasets don’t have] all of the toxic crap that you hoovered up when you were scraping the internet.”\n\nAlongside the quasi-religious commitment to AGI has been a narrative about the importance of racing to beat China in the AI race, so that Silicon Valley can have a liberalizing effect on the world.\n\n“Literally, the opposite has happened,” Hao said. “The gap has continued to close between the U.S. and China, and Silicon Valley has had an illiberalizing effect on the world … and the only actor that has come out of it unscathed, you could argue, is Silicon Valley itself.”\n\nOf course, many will argue that OpenAI and other AI companies have benefitted humanity by releasing ChatGPT and other large language models, which promise huge gains in productivity by automating tasks like coding, writing, research, customer support, and other knowledge-work tasks.\n\nBut the way OpenAI is structured — part non-profit, part for-profit — complicates how it defines and measures its impact on humanity. And that’s further complicated by the news this week that OpenAI reached an agreement with Microsoft that brings it closer to eventually going public.\n\nTwo former OpenAI safety researchers told TechCrunch that they fear the AI lab has begun to confuse its for-profit and non-profit missions — that because people enjoy using ChatGPT and other products built on LLMs, this ticks the box of benefiting humanity.\n\nHao echoed these concerns, describing the dangers of being so consumed by the mission that reality is ignored.\n\n“Even as the evidence accumulates that what they’re building is actually harming significant amounts of people, the mission continues to paper all of that over,” Hao said. “There’s something really dangerous and dark about that, of [being] so wrapped up in a belief system you constructed that you lose touch with reality.”",

      "description": "Penske's lawsuit accuses Google of abusing its monopoly power in search to force publishers to support AI summaries.",
      "content": "Google faces a new lawsuit accusing the company of illegally using news publishers’ content to create AI summaries that damage their business.\n\nThe lawsuit comes from Penske Media Corporation (PMC), which owns industry publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, Vibe, and Artforum. While Penske’s suit is the first to target Google and its parent company Alphabet over showing AI-generated summaries in search, both publishers and authors have sued other AI companies over related copyright concerns. Google also is also facing an antitrust complaint over AI Overviews in Europe.\n\n“As a leading global publisher, we have a duty to protect PMC’s best-in-class journalists and award-winning journalism as a source of truth,” said Penske Media CEO Jay Penske in a statement. “Furthermore, we have a responsibility to proactively fight for the future of digital media and preserve its integrity — all of which is threatened by Google’s current actions.”\n\nSince launching its AI Overviews last year, Google has been criticized for threatening the business models of the same publishers it relies on to provide the content needed to create accurate AI summaries and answers.\n\nThe new lawsuit goes farther by accusing Google of continuing to “wield its monopoly to coerce PMC into permitting Google to republish PMC’s content in AI Overviews” and to use that content to train its AI models.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda said in a statement that AI Overviews make Google search “more helpful” and create “new opportunities for content to be discovered.”\n\n“Every day, Google sends billions of clicks to sites across the web, and AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites,” Castañeda said. “We will defend against these meritless claims.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe lawsuit argues that while Penske Media allows Google to crawl its websites in an “exchange of access for traffic” that is “the fundamental bargain that supports the production of content for the open commercial Web,” Google has recently “begun to tie its participation in this bargain to another transaction to which PMC and other publishers do not willingly consent.”\n\n“As a condition of indexing publisher content for search, Google now requires publishers to also supply that content for other uses that cannibalize or preempt search referrals,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the only way for Penske to opt out would be to remove itself from Google search entirely, which would be “devastating.”\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that Penske has seen “significant declines in clicks from Google searches since Google started rolling out AI Overviews.” That means less ad revenue for the publisher, and it also threatens subscription and affiliate revenue, the company says: “These revenue streams rely on people actually visiting PMC sites.”\n\nAnd while Google has pushed back against complaints that AI Overviews reduce traffic to publishers, the lawsuit says, “Google has offered no credible competing information regarding search referral traffic.”\n\nPenske’s suit comes after Google seemingly dodged an antitrust bullet — while a federal judge had ruled the company acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, the judge did not to order the company to break up its businesses (for example by selling Chrome), due in part to an increasing competition in AI.\n\nThis post has been updated with a statement from Jay Penske.",

      "content": "Apple hosted its new hardware event today, releasing its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. For the iPhone 17 models, updates included larger screens and an improved camera system, as well as the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that replaces the Plus model.\n\nAnd the company may be announcing more new hardware soon, with Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting that a new iPad Pro, an updated Vision Pro, updated AirTags, a new Apple TV, a new HomePod mini, and updated MacBooks are coming in either 2025 or the first half of 2026.\n\niPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nThe iPhone 17 received a makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It features a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16. It also has a 120 Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60 Hz. The phone also has a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera.\n\nIt comes in new colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.\n\nThe Pro’s upgrades are mainly on the back of the phone. The three rear cameras are now arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone are positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is centered for aesthetic reasons.\n\nNotably, the iPhone 17 Pro switched materials, replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum.\n\nThe iPhone 17 starts at $799 and has a base storage of 256GB. In contrast, the iPhone 16 started at $699 for 128GB. The Pro model costs $1,099, and the Pro Max is $1,199.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Called “TechWoven” cases, these feature a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023.\n\nMissing from the keynote was any mention of an AI-enhanced Siri, which puts Apple way behind Google and its competitors.\n\niPhone Air\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nThe biggest announcement at the event was the debut of Apple’s slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which replaces the iPhone Plus.\n\nThis device has a profile thickness of 5.6 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It also features a 6.6-inch screen and a 120 Hz ProMotion display. The device is eSIM only, which helps the product maintain its sleek design.\n\nThis move appears to be Apple’s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple’s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.\n\nThe device is priced at $999 and will be available in black, white, sky blue, and light gold.\n\nApple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nAfter a two-year wait, Apple announced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, which includes faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. The watch also features a larger display.\n\nHowever, one of the most exciting upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure-monitoring capabilities. This feature notifies users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low.\n\nThe third-generation Apple Watch SE, meanwhile, didn’t receive major updates, aside from an always-on display, thanks to a faster S10 chip.\n\nPrices for the watches are $249 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $399 for the Series 11, and $799 for the Ultra 3.\n\nAirPods Pro 3\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nAfter the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it’s about time for an upgrade. The AirPods Pro 3, priced at $249, features smaller earbuds, improved audio, and a new heart-rate-sensing feature. It also features live translation technology, powered by Apple Intelligence, to help users translate foreign languages in real time.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\n",

      "description": "The competitive landscape of AI is changing in ways that undermine the advantages of the biggest AI labs.",
      "content": "How much do foundation models matter?\n\nIt might seem like a silly question, but it’s come up a lot in my conversations with AI startups, which are increasingly comfortable with businesses that used to be dismissed as “GPT wrappers,” or companies that build interfaces on top of existing AI models like ChatGPT. These days, startup teams are focused on customizing AI models for specific tasks and interface work, and see the foundation model as a commodity that can be swapped in and out as necessary. That approach was on display especially at last week’s Boxworks conference, which seemed devoted entirely to the user-facing software built on top of AI models.\n\nPart of what is driving this is that the scaling benefits of pre-training — that initial process of teaching AI models using massive datasets, which is the sole domain of foundation models — has slowed down. That doesn’t mean AI has stopped making progress, but the early benefits of hyperscaled foundational models have hit diminishing returns, and attention has turned to post-training and reinforcement learning as sources of future progress. If you want to make a better AI coding tool, you’re better off working on fine-tuning and interface design rather than spending another few billion dollars worth in server time on pre-training. As the success of Anthropic’s Claude Code shows, foundation model companies are quite good at these other fields too — but it’s not as durable an advantage as it used to be.\n\nIn short, the competitive landscape of AI is changing in ways that undermine the advantages of the biggest AI labs. Instead of a race for an all-powerful AGI that could match or exceed human abilities across all cognitive tasks, the immediate future looks like a flurry of discrete businesses: software development, enterprise data management, image generation and so on. Aside from a first-mover advantage, it’s not clear that building a foundation model gives you any advantage in those businesses. Worse, the abundance of open-source alternatives means that foundation models may not have any price leverage if they lose the competition at the application layer. This would turn companies like OpenAI and Anthropic into back-end suppliers in a low-margin commodity business – as one founder put it to me, “like selling coffee beans to Starbucks.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate what a dramatic shift this would be for the business of AI. Throughout the contemporary boom, the success of AI has been inextricable from the success of the companies building foundation models — specifically, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Being bullish on AI meant believing that AI’s transformative impact would make these into generationally important companies. We could argue about which company would come out on top, but it was clear that some foundation model company was going to end up with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nAt the time, there were lots of reasons to think this was true. For years, foundation model development was the only AI business there was — and the fast pace of progress made their lead seem insurmountable. And Silicon Valley has always had a deep-rooted love of platform advantage. The assumption was that, however AI models ended up making money, the lion’s share of the benefit would flow back to the foundation model companies, who had done the work that was hardest to replicate.\n\nThe past year has made that story more complicated. There are lots of successful third-party AI services, but they tend to use foundation models interchangeably. For startups, it no longer matters whether their product sits on top of GPT-5, Claude or Gemini, and they expect to be able to switch models in mid-release without end users noticing the difference. Foundation models continue to make real progress, but it no longer seems plausible for any one company to maintain a large enough advantage to dominate the industry.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

As venture capitalist Martin Casado of a16z pointed out on a recent podcast, OpenAI was the first lab to put out a coding model, as well as generative models for image and video — only to lose all three categories to competitors. “As far as we can tell, there is no inherent moat in the technology stack for AI,” Casado concluded.\n\nOf course, we shouldn’t count foundation model companies out just yet. There are still lots of durable advantages on their side, including brand recognition, infrastructure, and unthinkably vast cash reserves. OpenAI’s consumer business may prove harder to replicate than its coding business, and other advantages may emerge as the sector matures. Given the fast pace of AI development, the current interest in post-training could easily reverse course in the next six months. Most uncertain of all, the race toward general intelligence could pay off with new breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals or materials science, radically shifting our ideas about what makes AI models valuable.\n\nBut in the meantime, the strategy of building ever-bigger foundation models looks a lot less appealing than it did last year — and Meta’s billion-dollar spending spree is starting to look awfully risky.",

      "content": "Welcome back! Did you miss me? Yes, of course you did. There is a lot of “future of transportation” news to keep track of. Let’s jump in.\n\nIt’s comeback week, and not just because I have returned from vacation. I’m talking about the biennial IAA Mobility conference in Munich and the purposeful effort among German automakers to show the world it can still offer compelling, technologically advanced, and affordable vehicles. The subtext of the splashy event that started Tuesday: “Hey, China, we’re not out of the race.”\n\nVW Group, Mercedes, and BMW all showcased numerous new vehicles, including electric ones. And executives made their battle cries: VW Group Oliver Blume struck a bullish tone in a few interviews with reporters and laid out the company’s plan to be competitive in China, particularly with EVs, a category where VW has lagged.\n\nBut what about on the home front? Chinese automakers have been pushing into Europe, and consumers have responded. The German automakers are hoping their latest products — including a new all-electric Mercedes GLC, the BMW iX3 with its four “superbrain” computers, and the Volkswagen ID Polo and ID Cross concept — will preserve and even grow market share. But they have some work to do. Chinese companies like BYD almost doubled their market share in Europe over the past year, JATO Dynamics reported in July.\n\nOne other IAA news item of note: Rimac Technology, the tech and parts unit of Rimac Group, has developed solid-state battery packs it says will be available by late 2027. These batteries apparently pack in the energy and can be charged from 10% to 80% in under 10 minutes.\n\nTo get TechCrunch Mobility in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility!\n\nA little bird\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\n\nHyundai appears to still be committed to Motional, according to two little birds who have shared new investment information with me.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Aptiv backed out in early 2024, leaving Hyundai to either invest its own money, find other outside partners, or shutter the program altogether. Hyundai opted to invest $1 billion — $475 million directly into Motional as part of a broader deal that includes buying out joint venture partner Aptiv. Hyundai agreed to spend another $448 million to buy 11% of Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional.\n\nNow it appears Hyundai is investing more into Motional in two tranches. The first is being dispersed this year and is about $452 million. The second comes next year, and I’m still trying to nail down that amount. That first figure is in line with reporting from a Korean outlet. Hyundai declined (a couple of times!) to respond to my questions about the funding. That’s pretty typical for large corporations to stay mum. However, one little bird who is deep within the AV industry also noted that Hyundai might not want to make a big deal about this, considering it’s also working with Waymo.\n\nIn other little bird chirpings, there are two new hires at General Motors that you might find interesting. Sony Mohapatra, the former senior manager of AI compute platforms at Cruise, has landed as director of AI and machine learning engineering at General Motors. And Paul Menson, who was the senior staff account manager of Megapack at Tesla, is now director of energy storage systems business development at General Motors.\n\nGot a tip for us?

The company, as I have mentioned before, has been batting around plans for an IPO for years.\n\nEarlier this year, it filed confidentially for an IPO — the second time it took this step. But this time, Via took the big IPO leap. The company, which is known for its Citymapper mobile navigation app, said it sold 10.7 million shares for $46 per share. In all, Via raised $492.9 million at a $3.7 billion valuation. That’s just slightly above its $3.5 billion valuation that it garnered back in 2023 during its last venture raise.\n\nWe had to wrap up this newsletter before it officially began trading, but I’ll be back next week with an update.\n\nOther deals that got my attention …\n\nArc Boats, the Los Angeles startup founded in 2021 by former SpaceX employees, signed a $160 million contract with Curtin Maritime for new hybrid-electric tugs, which are expected to hit the waters around the Los Angeles port in 2027.\n\nLeydenJar, the Netherlands-based battery materials startup, raised €13 million ($15.2 million) in a round led by Extantia and Invest-NL.\n\nStandard Fleet, a fleet management software company, raised $13 million in a Series A round led by Nova Threshold with participation from WEX Venture Capital, SNR, Garry Tan (CEO of Y Combinator), Salil Deshpande (Uncorrelated Ventures), and Apoorv Bhargava (WeaveGrid).

      "content": "In Brief\n\nWith Tesla shareholders set to vote on a proposed 10-year, $1 trillion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk in November, board chair Robyn Denholm spoke to The New York Times to defend what would be the largest pay package in corporate history.\n\nDenholm, who was also on the special committee that put the compensation proposal together, argued that Musk needs to be motivated by extraordinary challenges tied to extraordinary compensation. At the same time, she suggested he’s less interested in the additional wealth that the promised Tesla shares would represent, and more in the voting power.\n\n“I think it’s a little bit weird talking about the dollars when it’s actually the voting influence,” said Denholm, whom The Times described as “occasionally appearing ill at ease” during the interview.\n\nIt might also seem counterintuitive to offer such a massive pay package when Tesla’s profits and vehicle sales are falling, but Denholm insisted that the plan is about “future performance.”\n\n“It’s not about past performance,” she said. “He gets nothing if he doesn’t perform against the goals.”\n\nAs TechCrunch previously noted, the package’s goals are considerably less ambitious than some of the promises Musk has made about Tesla in the past.",

      "description": "Rainmaker wants to use flares to seed clouds — the airline pilots' union says it won't be safe.",
      "content": "Rainmaker Technology’s bid to deploy cloud-seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union, which has urged the Federal Aviation Administration to consider denying the startup’s request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines.\n\nThe FAA’s decision will signal how the regulator views weather modification by unmanned aerial systems going forward. Rainmaker’s bet on small drones hangs in the balance.\n\nThe Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) told the FAA that Rainmaker’s petition “fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety” and poses “an extreme safety risk.”\n\nHowever, Rainmaker CEO Augustus Doricko said an email that all of the union’s objections are based on only the public notice, rather than non-public documents submitted to the FAA that outline all of the company’s safety data and risk mitigations.\n\nRainmaker is seeking an exemption from rules that bar small drones from carrying hazardous materials. The startup filed in July, and the FAA has yet to rule. Instead, it issued a follow-up request for information, pressing for specifics on operations and safety.\n\nIn its filing, Rainmaker proposed using two flare types, one “burn-in-place” and the other ejectable, on its Elijah quadcopter, to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation. Elijah has a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet MSL (measured from sea level), which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly. Drones need permission from Air Traffic Control to fly inside this bubble.\n\nRainmaker’s petition says it will operate in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace unless otherwise authorized. ALPA notes the filing doesn’t clearly state where flights would occur or what altitudes would be used. However, Doricko said the documents submitted to the FAA disclosed that in addition to the flights being constrained to a max altitude of 15,000 feet MSL, they will be conducted in airspace that is predetermined to be safe by aviation authorities, “voiding any reasonable concern about high altitude flight or airspace coordination.” ALPA did not reply to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe union also objects to the flares themselves, citing concerns about foreign object debris and fire safety. ALPA points out that the petition does not include trajectory modeling of the ejectable casings or analysis on the environmental impacts of chemical agents.\n\n“Regarding their objection to the use of flares, independent bodies like this administration’s EPA and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding,” Doricko said.\n\nSam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager, said the company respects the pilot’s union and hopes to “continue to strengthen our relationship with the organization,” but claimed the objection “shows a lack of understanding of why Rainmaker has filed for this exemption.”\n\n“Our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations,” Kim added.\n\nDoricko said that a typical Rainmaker operation disperses 50-100 grams of silver iodide, and far less than that in a flight with flares, while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics, sulfur oxides, and soot – significantly more material than a Rainmaker op.\n\n“Rainmaker is interested in doing the best, responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide. ALPA’s objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our CONOP, all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non-public docs that the FAA is reviewing now,” Doricko said.\n\n“Regarding ALPA’s concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace, our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals, intentional coordination with local ATC, certified pilots, and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers,” he said.\n\nHowever, Rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords “with whom Rainmaker has developed close working relationships.”\n\nCloud-seeding already happens today, largely in the western U.S., with crewed airplanes flown in coordination with state agencies. Ski resorts commission the operations to help keep their runs white, and irrigation and water districts fly them to build snowpack in the winter to help feed their reservoirs during the spring melt.\n\nThe general practice of cloud seeding dates back to the 1950s. By spraying small particles into certain clouds, scientists found they could induce precipitation. Typically, cloud-seeding operations use silver iodide for the particles, mostly because they mimic the shape of ice crystals.\n\nWhen a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super-cooled, they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point. Once the ice crystal forms, it can grow quickly if conditions are right, faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances. Plus, the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet, which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation.\n\nRainmaker’s twist — doing this work with drones instead of pilots — could prove safer in the longer term. The company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded, overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews, over rural areas, with other safety checks in place.\n\nWhat happens next hinges on whether the FAA thinks those mitigations are sufficient. However it’s decided, the agency’s response will likely set the tone for novel cloud-seeding approaches.\n\n9/13/2025: The story has been updated to include Rainmaker’s comments from Augustus Doricko, founder and CEO, and Sam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager.",

      "content": "California’s state senate gave final approval early on Saturday morning to a major AI safety bill setting new transparency requirements on large companies.\n\nAs described by its author, state senator Scott Wiener, SB 53 “requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety protocols, creates whistleblower protections for [employees] at AI labs & creates a public cloud to expand compute access (CalCompute).”\n\nThe bill now goes to California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign or veto. He has not commented publicly on SB 53, but last year, he vetoed a more expansive safety bill also authored by Wiener, while signing narrower legislation targeting issues like deepfakes.\n\nAt the time, Newsom acknowledged the importance of “protecting the public from real threats posed by this technology,” but criticized Wiener’s previous bill for applying “stringent standards” to large models regardless of whether they were “deployed in high-risk environments, [involved] critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data.”\n\nWiener said the new bill was influenced by recommendations from a policy panel of AI experts that Newsom convened after his veto.\n\nPolitico also reports that SB 53 was recently amended so that companies developing “frontier” AI models while bringing in less than $500 million in annual revenue will only need to disclose high level safety details, while companies making more than that will need to provide more detailed reports.\n\nA number of Silicon Valley companies, VC firms, and lobbying groups have criticized the bill, as well as broader efforts by states to regulate AI. In a recent letter to Newsom, OpenAI did not mention SB 53 specifically but argued that to avoid “duplication and inconsistencies,” companies should be considered compliant with statewide safety rules as long as they meet federal or European standards.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

      "description": "From phone spyware and facial recognition to forensic phone hacking technology to databases and more, this tech powers Trump's deportation machine.",
      "content": "President Donald Trump made countering immigration one of his flagship issues during last year’s presidential campaign, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nIn his first eight months in office, that promise turned into around 350,000 deportations, a figure that includes deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (around 200,000), Customs and Border Protection (more than 132,000), and almost 18,000 self-deportations, according to CNN.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass deportation campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented immigrants. To aid its efforts, the ICE has at its disposal several technologies capable of identifying and surveilling individuals and communities.\n\nHere is a recap of some of the technology that ICE has in its digital arsenal.\n\nClearview AI facial recognition\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about ICE and the technology it uses?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\n\nParagon phone spyware\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, it’s unclear what’s the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Parago is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company Red Lattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nLexisNexis’ legal and public records databases\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to subscribe to the service.\n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nSurveillance giant Palantir\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with Palantir. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\n404 Media cited “a source familiar with the database,” who said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.",
