      "content": "India and Canada reset ties after strain of Sikh leader's murder\n\n1 hour ago Share Save Neyaz Farooquee BBC News, Delhi Share Save\n\nPTI Anita Anand (left) with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi\n\nIndia and Canada have agreed a host of steps at talks between their foreign ministers in Delhi aimed at restoring ties that plummeted after a Sikh separatist leader was assassinated on Canadian soil. Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand, making her first official visit to India, met her counterpart S Jaishankar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi told her the visit would strengthen \"efforts to impart new momentum\" to the two countries' partnership. Relations hit rock bottom in 2023 when Canada's then PM Justin Trudeau accused India of being linked to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, claims Delhi denied. Both countries suspended visa services and expelled each other's top diplomats.\n\nCanada is home to nearly 1.7 million people of Indian origin and the developments were being watched anxiously in both countries. After the meeting of their foreign ministers in Delhi, the two sides announced a series of measures, including starting ministerial-level discussions on bilateral trade and investment. \"Reviving this partnership will not only create opportunities for enhanced economic cooperation but also help mitigate vulnerabilities arising from shifting global alliances,\" a joint statement said. Signs of a thaw have appeared this year since Mark Carney took over as Canadian prime minister. In June, Carney and Modi held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada. Two months later, the countries appointed new high commissioners to each other's countries. Anand and Jaishankar also met each other on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York in September.\n\nX/MEA Jaishankar said India-Canada ties had been making steady progress",

      "description": "The US president was applauded by Israeli lawmakers for his role in brokering an Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "content": "'Long and painful nightmare finally over,' Trump tells Israel's parliament\n\n2 hours ago Share Save James FitzGerald Share Save\n\nWatch: 'It will be a golden age for the Middle East' - Trump\n\nUS President Donald Trump has told cheering Israeli lawmakers that \"the long and painful nightmare is finally over\", after helping to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. During the first such address by a US president since 2008, Trump said the day would mark \"the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better\" in the Middle East. Trump's address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, comes on the day that the last 20 living hostages held in the Palestinian enclave were released by Hamas. Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza.\n\nDuring a whirlwind trip to the region, Trump will also attend a peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and other world leaders. After hearing politicians' chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\" in the Knesset, the American president suggested the region was experiencing \"the historic dawn of a new Middle East\". It echoed the words he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency. \"At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" Trump said. The ceasefire that he helped to broker was \"the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever\", Trump added. He indicated that ending the war between Russia and Ukraine would be his next focus. Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming \"bad\" and \"heated\". Trump's speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said \"Recognise Palestine\". At least one person was escorted out of the room.\n\nTrump was introduced to parliament by Netanyahu, who saluted his counterpart's various acts of solidarity with Israel. Trump was the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu said. \"Everything changed\" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, Netanyahu added. The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his \"unremitting help\" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas. Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: \"He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"\n\nReuters Trump was the 'greatest friend' Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu said\n\nThe ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated. Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a \"board of peace\" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory. In his remarks to parliament, Netanyahu said he was \"committed to this peace\". Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire. Kushner was accompanied by his wife Ivanka Trump. Members of Trump's audience wore red caps. Instead of Trump's signature slogan \"Make America Great Again\", they read \"Trump the Peace President\". Trump was told by the parliamentary speaker that there was \"no-one\" more deserving of next year's Nobel Peace Prize. But some Israeli lawmakers who want the war in Gaza to continue did not attend.",

      "content": "Afghan Taliban says Pakistani troops killed in 'retaliatory' border attacks\n\nA military patrol in Shorabak district near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border on 12 October\n\nPakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the Afghan attacks were \"unprovoked\" and civilians were fired at, warning that his country's forces would respond \"with a stone for every brick\".\n\nPakistan has disputed that figure, saying 23 of its armed forces' members had died and claiming that \"200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized\".\n\nA Taliban spokesman said 58 Pakistani military personnel had been killed in what it called \"an act of retaliation\". It claimed Pakistan had violated Afghan airspace and bombed a market inside its border on Thursday.\n\nThe Taliban government has confirmed that it attacked Pakistani troops in multiple mountainous locations on the northern border.\n\nIslamabad has accused Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban government rejected.\n\nBoth the Afghan and Pakistani sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands.\n\nAt a press conference on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in addition to the 58 Pakistani military deaths, around 30 others had been wounded.\n\nHe added that nine Taliban fighters had died and between 16 and 18 people had been injured.\n\nPakistan Armed Forces said 29 of its soldiers had been injured, and the number of wounded Taliban and \"affiliated\" fighters was in the hundreds.\n\nAfghanistan’s foreign minister said in a press conference in New Delhi that \"we have no problems\" with Pakistan's people and its leadership but added \"there are some groups in Pakistan that are trying to spoil the situation. Afghanistan has a right to keep its territory and its borders safe, and so it has retaliated to the violation.\"\n\nPakistan's interior minister said he \"strongly condemns\" the Taliban's attacks: \"The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws.\n\n\"Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nThe two main crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Torkham in the north and Chaman in the south - have been closed, leaving hundreds of trucks carrying goods stranded on both sides.\n\nA Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties.\n\nPakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source speaking to the BBC claimed that firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha.\n\nA police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT).\n\nHe said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border.\n\nLast week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's \"sovereign territory\", as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday.\n\nPakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed.\n\nA top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a \"base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan\".\n\nPakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban, known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban government has always denied this.\n\nThe latest escalation coincided with an historic week-long trip to India made by Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, his first since the Taliban's return to power.\n\nIn a diplomatic thaw, New Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago.\n\n\"Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,\" Naqvi warned.\n\nIn a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul.\n\nQatar also expressed concern over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, calling on both sides to \"prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint\".",

Mr Singh, an Indian passport holder, has lived in the US on a green card since 1994. He lives in Indiana with his family, who own a chain of gas stations. His wife and two children are US citizens. But Mr Singh now faces the threat of deportation. On 30 July, he was detained by immigration authorities at Chicago O'Hare International Airport while returning from a trip to India and has since been in their custody. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities have cited two decades-old cases as reasons for his detention, but Mr Singh's family and lawyer say there are no active cases against him. They accuse immigration authorities of using old cases to delay his release and allege he lacks proper medical care despite a brain tumour and heart condition. \"Paramjit Singh is not getting the medical help he needs. He is only getting medical check-ups,\" his lawyer, Louis Angeles, told the BBC.

The Hague said it took the decision due to \"serious governance shortcomings\" and to prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency. Nexperia's owner Wingtech said on Monday that it would take actions to protect its rights and would seek government support. The development threatens to raise tensions between the European Union and China, which have increased in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia.\n\nIn December 2024, the US government placed Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport, after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. The Dutch Economic Ministry said it made the \"highly exceptional\" decision to invoke the Goods Availability Act over \"acute signals of serious governance shortcomings\" within Nexperia. \"These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.\" The statement did not detail why it thought the firm's operations were risky. A spokesperson for the minister of economic affairs told the BBC there was no further information to share.\n\n'Mitigating risk'",

      "title": "Trump says Ukraine may get Tomahawk missiles to use against Russia",
      "description": "Ukraine wants long-range missiles to hit back at Russia - and Donald Trump says he may send Tomahawks.",
      "content": "Trump says he may send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine\n\nMoscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations.\n\nThe comments follow a phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russia.\n\nAsked by reporters on Air Force One on Sunday whether he would provide Kyiv with Tomahawks, Trump replied: \"We'll see... I may\". The missiles would be \"a new step of aggression\" in Ukraine's war with Russia, he said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.\n\nTomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach for Ukraine.\n\nTrump said he would possibly speak to Russia about the Tomahawks requested by Ukraine.\n\n\"I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, we may not, but we may do it.\"\n\n\"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,\" the US president added.\n\nOn Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the topic of Tomahawks was of \"extreme concern\" to Russia. \"Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,\" he said.\n\nIn September Peskov dismissed the threat of Tomahawks, saying they would not be able to \"change the dynamic\" of the war.\n\nBut in his comments on Sunday he noted that if Tomahawks were launched at Russia Moscow would not be able to tell whether they were carrying nuclear warheads.\n\n\"What should the Russian Federation think? Just how should Russia react?\", he said.\n\nOn Monday morning former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev doubled down on Peskov's comments.\n\n\"How should Russia respond? Exactly!\" Medvedev said on social media.\n\n\"The delivery of these missiles could end badly for everyone. And first of all – for Trump himself,\" he wrote.\n\nMedvedev, who over the last few years has grown into an increasingly hawkish figure, frequently posts on social media espousing more extreme positions than the Kremlin's.\n\nHe and Trump have sparred online before. Comments by Medvedev in August led Trump to say he had ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia.\n\nSince the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict.",

      "description": "Thousands of people gather in Gaza and the West Bank to welcome Palestinian prisoners and detainees freed by Israel.",
      "content": "Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by Israel\n\nThey were freed as part of an exchange in which 20 Israeli hostages, and the remains of some deceased hostages, were released by Hamas.\n\nAs prisoners exited a Red Cross bus in Ramallah, many draped in traditional Keffiyeh scarves, they looked pale and gaunt, with some struggling to walk.\n\nThe release involved about 250 prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge.\n\nHundreds of freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been welcomed with tears and screams of joy as they were released by Israel to be reunited with their families in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n\nIt is thought about 100 prisoners were released into the West Bank, with many others set to be deported and a small number freed into East Jerusalem.\n\n\"I want peace,\" Mr Abudullah said. \"I want to live a happy life, safe and peaceful, without occupation and without restrictions.\"\n\n\"He is ready to embrace freedom,\" said Amro Abdullah, 24, who was waiting for his cousin Rashid Omar, 48, who was arrested in July 2005 and sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court after being found guilty of murder and other crimes.\n\nIsrael made clear before the release process that it wanted to avoid the jubilant scenes that surrounded prisoners arriving in Ramallah during previous hostage deals, when large crowds waved Hamas flags.\n\nMany families were reluctant to speak to the media, saying they had been warned against doing so by the Israeli military.\n\nIn Gaza, families gathered at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the hope of being reunited with their loved ones. A field hospital adjacent to the main hospital building was set up to receive them.\n\n\"This is a very beautiful feeling - happy, a day of joy,\" said Muhammad Hasan Saeed Dawood, 50, who told the BBC he was there to collect his son who he says was arrested by Israeli forces at a checkpoint.\n\n\"We call it a national holiday, that our detainees are being released despite the cost of the war, the martyrs, the injured, and the destruction in Gaza.\"\n\nKhalil Muhammad Abdulrahman Al-Qatrous, who was also there to collect his son who he said had been detained for about three months, said: \"There is joy, and there is pain, and there is happiness, and there is sorrow.\"\n\n\"We came here waiting for their release. We came here expecting them to arrive at 10:00, and now it is past 12:00, and we are still waiting, on edge.\"\n\nAhead of the release in Ramallah, ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society set up in preparation to treat any injured prisoners.\n\n\"The crying and the silence, this shows you how the families are feeling,\" said Ibrahim Ifani, 23, a volunteer nurse for the organisation.\n\n\"For all the people in Palestine, it's a deep, deep emotion,\" he said.\n\nMultiple medics and family members said the prisoners who were released in Ramallah had faced beatings in recent days prior to their release.\n\nThe BBC cannot verify claims of mistreatment in Israeli prisons. But Israel's top court said last month that Palestinian prisoners were not being given adequate food.\n\nThe BBC has also previously reported on Palestinians being tortured in Israeli detention.\n\n\"Their rights were violated in the most serious ways,\" said Aya Shreiteh, 26, from the Palestinian Prisoners Club.\n\n\"Most of the prisoners in the past year were subjected to deliberate starvation and exposure to illness,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"Their bodies are frail from starvation, and they've suffered from beatings.\"\n\n\"But today gives us hope that there will always be an inevitable freedom, no matter the circumstances,\" she added.\n\nThe hostage and prisoner exchange formed part of phase one of Donald Trump's peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\n\nIsrael launched a retaliatory military offensive which saw more than 67,682 Palestinians killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nA ceasefire took hold on Friday - and negotiations are now expected to follow over the latter phases of Trump's peace plan.",

      "content": "Who are the released hostages?\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nThe Israeli military says 20 living hostages have been released by Hamas and have returned to Israel. Until Monday, 48 hostages were still being held in Gaza, although some are believed to be dead. All but one of the hostages were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nHostages who Israel says have been released\n\nIDF Israel shared images of some of the released hostages meeting with the IDF in Gaza on Monday - pictured is Ziv Berman\n\nAriel Cunio, 28, was abducted in the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October. Ariel's brother Eitan, who escaped the Hamas-led gunmen, said the last message from Ariel said: \"We are in a horror movie.\" Ariel's partner, Arbel Yehud, was freed in January 2025 under a deal that saw Hamas hand over 25 living and eight dead hostages during a two-month ceasefire. David Cunio, 35, another of Ariel's brothers, was also kidnapped from Nir Oz. David's wife Sharon Aloni Cunio and their then-three-year-old twin daughters Ema and Yuly were among the 105 hostages released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. Sharon's sister Danielle Aloni and her daughter Emilia were also freed. In February 2025, David's family said released hostages had told them that had recently seen him alive. Gali and Ziv Berman, 28-year-old twin brothers, were abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza with their neighbour, Emily Damari. Ziv was held with Emily for 40 days before they were separated. She was released in January 2025 during the last ceasefire. Gali and Ziv's family said they had been informed by other hostages released in early 2025 that they were still alive.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Twins Gali and Ziv Berman were taken hostage along with their British-Israeli neighbour Emily Damari, who has since been released\n\nMatan Angrest, a 22-year-old Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier, was in a tank that was attacked near the Gaza perimeter fence on 7 October. One video showed a crowd pulling him from the tank unconscious and injured. Earlier this year, his family said they had been told by released hostages that he was suffering from chronic asthma, untreated burns and infections. Matan Zangauker, 25, was taken with his partner Ilana Gritzewsky from Nir Oz. Ilana was released during the November 2023 ceasefire. In December 2024, Hamas released a video showing Matan in captivity. He said he and his fellow hostages were suffering from skin ailments, shortages of food, water and medicine. Eitan Horn, 38, an Israeli-Argentine dual national, was kidnapped along with his elder brother Yair from Nir Oz. Yair was freed in February 2025 during the last ceasefire. Hamas released a video at the time showing Eitan and Yair hugging and breaking down in tears ahead of the latter's release. \"Every day we imagined what we'd do if we were freed,\" Yair recalled recently. Nimrod Cohen, 21, was serving as an IDF soldier when his tank was attacked by Hamas at Nahal Oz. In February 2025, his family were told by one of the released hostages that he was still alive in captivity but in poor physical and mental shape. After the new ceasefire was agreed, his mother Viki posted on social media: \"My child, you are coming home.\" Omri Miran, 48, was abducted from his home in Nahal Oz. His wife, Lishay, said she last saw him being driven away in his own car. She and their two young daughters, Roni and Alma, were not taken with him. In April 2025, Hamas released a video showing Omri marking his 48th birthday. In response: Lishay said: \"I always said and I always knew, Omri is a survivor.\"\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Hamas published a video earlier this year purporting to show Omri Miran alive\n\nGuy Gilboa-Dalal, 24, attended the Nova music festival, where dozens of people were taken hostage, with his brother, Gal. The last time they saw each other was just before Hamas launched its first barrage of rockets into Israel at the start of the attack. Gal evaded the gunmen on the ground, but Guy was kidnapped. Last month, Hamas released a video showing Guy and another hostage, Alon Ohel, being driven around Gaza City in late August as the Israeli military prepared to launch an offensive there. Alon Ohel, 24, has Israeli, German and Serbian citizenship. Hamas footage showed him being taken away as a hostage from the Nova festival. Alon was not seen in another video until August 2025, when he was filmed being driven around Gaza City with Guy Gilboa-Dalal. Last month, Alon's family approved the publication of a still from a new video which they said showed he had gone blind in one eye. Yosef-Chaim Ohana, 25, had been at the festival with a friend, who said they had remained to help people escape the gunfire before running themselves. In May 2025, Hamas published a video showing Yosef and another hostage, Elkana Bohbot. Yosef is seen sitting beside Elkana, who is lying on the ground. An intravenous drip is hooked up to the wall next to Elkana.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Yosef-Chaim Ohana was captured while trying to help others flee Hamas gunmen\n\nElkana Bohbot, 36, was working at the festival when he was abducted. \"In our last conversation on the morning of the massacre at 07:00, I told him, 'It's not just missiles, come home,' and he promised he would return,\" his wife Rikva said in March 2025. The previous month, Israeli media cited a released hostage as saying Elkana, who has asthma, was being held in inhumane conditions and had developed a severe skin disease. Avinatan Or, 32, was kidnapped at the festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, but they were immediately separated. Noa and three other hostages were rescued in an Israeli military operation in central Gaza in June 2024. In March 2025, Avinatan's family said they had received a sign that he was still alive. His British-Israeli mother, Ditza, has said she just wants to put her ear to his chest and hear his heartbeat again. Eitan Mor, 25, was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival. His father Mor said he saved dozens of people before being kidnapped by Hamas gunmen. In February 2025, Eitan's family said they had received a sign of life from him. Three months later, they said a released hostage who spent time with him in a tunnel had told them how he had acted as a \"spokesman to the captors\" and \"lifted everyone's spirits\". Maxim Herkin, 37, is an Israel-Russian dual national who was invited to the festival at the last moment. His two friends were among the 378 people killed in the attack. In April 2025, Maxim appeared in a Hamas video along with Bar Kupershtein - the first signs of life from either man since they were taken hostage. The following month, Maxim was seen alone in another video and appeared to be bandaged up. Hamas said was the result of an Israeli air strike.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Maxim Herkin is one of two dual nationals believed to still be alive in Hamas captivity\n\nBar Kupershtein, 23, was working at the festival and stayed behind during the attack to help treat casualties. He told his grandmother that he would head home as soon as they were finished. But he was later identified in a video of hostages. They heard no further information about him until April 2025, when he was seen in a video with Maxim Herkin. Segev Kalfon, 27, was running away from the festival with a friend when he was taken hostage by Hamas gunmen. Two months later, the Israeli military found a video of the abduction. In February 2025, released hostage Ohad Ben Ami told Segev's father, Kobi, that they had been held captive with four other men in a tunnel in \"terrible conditions\". Evyatar David, 24, was at the festival and on the morning of the attacks. He texted the family to say \"they are bombarding the party\". His family say they later received a text from an unknown number, containing video footage of Evyatar handcuffed on the floor of a dark room. In August 2025, Hamas published a video of an emaciated and weak Evyatar in a tunnel. The footage caused outrage in Israel and deep concern among his family. \"He's a human skeleton. He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment,\" said his brother Ilay. Rom Braslabski, 21, was working on security for the festival. According to an account published by Hostages and Missing Families Forum, he was trying to rescue an injured person in the attack when he was caught in a volley of fire. In August 2025, Palestinian Islamic Jihad published a video of Rom, in which he is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\". Medical experts said he was suffering from \"deliberate, prolonged, and systematic starvation\".\n\nHostages whose conditions are unknown\n\nTamir Nimrodi, 20, was an education officer in the IDF at the Erez Crossing on 7 October. The last time his mother, Herut, saw him was in a video of his abduction posted on social media that day. Since then, she has received no signs of life and his fate is unknown. Bipin Joshi, 24, a Nepalese agriculture student, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Alumim. Footage from 7 October 2023 showed him walking inside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. His family received no signs of life for a year, until the Israeli military shared a video showing him in captivity around November 2023. The family released the footage just before the new ceasefire was announced, describing it as \"proof of life\". However, Nepal's ambassador to Israel has now told the BBC that Israeli authorities have said there are no signs that Bipin has survived.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Bipin Joshi is one of two men whose status is uncertain\n\nHostages who are confirmed dead\n\nTamir Adar, 38, was a member of Nir Oz's community security squad who was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attack, his kibbutz announced in January 2024. The body of the farmer and father-of-two is being held by Hamas in Gaza. Sonthaya Akrasri, 30, was a Thai agricultural worker killed in the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, Thailand's foreign ministry said in May 2024, citing the available evidence. His body is being held by Hamas in Gaza. Muhammad al-Atarash, 39, was a sergeant-major in the IDF and served as a tracker. In June 2024, the IDF confirmed the father-of-13 from the Bedouin village of Sawa was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen near Nahal Oz on 7 October and that his body was being held in Gaza. Sahar Baruch, 24, was kidnapped from Be'eri. In January 2024, the IDF announced that he had been killed during a rescue attempt by Israeli forces in Gaza. It was not clear whether he was killed by Hamas or Israeli gunfire. Uriel Baruch, 35, was abducted from the Nova festival. In March 2024, the father-of-two's family said they had been informed by the IDF that he was killed in captivity in Gaza. Inbar Hayman, 27, was kidnapped during the attack on the Nova festival and was killed by Hamas in captivity, her family said. She is the last female hostage being held.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Inbar Hayman, believed to be dead, is the last woman being held by Hamas\n\nItay Chen, 19, was an Israeli-American who was serving as a soldier in the IDF on 7 October. The IDF said he was killed during Hamas's attack on Nahal Oz base and that his body was taken back to Gaza as a hostage. Amiram Cooper, 85, was abducted from Nir Oz. The IDF said in June 2024 that he had been killed along with three other hostages - Nadav Popplewell, Chaim Peri and Yoram Metzger - months earlier in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. The IDF said it had been operating in the area at the time but did not confirm how they were killed. Hamas had earlier claimed they were killed by an IDF strike. Oz Daniel, 19, was a sergeant in the IDF's 7th Armoured Brigade and was killed during a battle with Hamas gunmen near the Gaza perimeter fence on 7 October. His body was taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the IDF. Ronen Engel, 54, was kidnapped from Nir Oz on 7 October along with his wife, Karina Engel-Bart, and their daughters, Mika and Yuval. Karina, Mika and Yuval were released during the ceasefire in November 2023. The following month, the IDF confirmed that Ronen has been killed in captivity. Meny Godard, 73, was killed during the attack on Be'eri with his wife, Ayelet, and his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage, his family said in February 2024. In March 2025, the IDF said some of Meny's remains had been found at a Palestinian Islamic Jihad outpost in Rafah, but that the group was believed to be holding the rest.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Meny Godard's body was taken into Gaza after Hamas killed him alongside his wife\n\nRan Gvili, 24, was a sergeant in the Israel Police who was killed while fighting Hamas-led gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim on 7 October. His body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the IDF. Tal Haimi, 41, was part of Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak's rapid response team and was killed during the attack there on 7 October. The father-of-four's body was taken to Gaza, where it is still being held. Asaf Hamami, 41, was a colonel in the IDF and commander of the Gaza Division's Southern Brigade. He was killed near Kibbutz Nirim on 7 October and his body is being held in Gaza, according to the IDF. Guy Illouz, 26, was shot twice during the attack on the Nova festival and died of his wounds after being taken hostage, his family said. Released hostages are said to have confirmed his death.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum Guy Illouz died in captivity as a result of injuries sustained in the attack on the Nova festival\n\nEitan Levi, 53, was a taxi driver who was killed by Hamas gunmen on a road close to the Gaza perimeter on 7 October. His body was then taken to Gaza, where Palestinians were filmed beating and kicking it. Eliyahu Margalit, 75, was killed by Hamas fighters in Nir Oz on 7 October, the IDF confirmed in December 2023. His body is being held in Gaza. Joshua Mollel, 21, was a Tanzanian student who was undertaking an agricultural internship at Kibbutz Nahal Oz when it was attacked on 7 October. The Tanzanian government confirmed in December 2023 that he was killed that day and that his body was being held by Hamas. Omer Neutra, 21, an Israeli-American and grandson of Holocaust survivors, was serving as an IDF tank commander near Gaza when Hamas attacked on 7 October. The IDF later said he was killed that day and his body taken to Gaza. Daniel Peretz, 22, was a captain in the IDF's 7th Armoured Brigade. Originally from South Africa, he was killed in an attack on his tank near Nahal Oz on 7 October and his body was taken to Gaza, the IDF said. Dror Or, 48, and his wife, Yonat, were killed in the attack on Be'eri, the kibbutz confirmed in February 2024.

      "content": "Madagascar presidency says attempt to seize power under way\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Sammy Awami BBC Africa, Antananarivo and Farouk Chothia Share Save\n\nAFP via Getty Images Some troops joined protesters in the capital on Saturday\n\nThe office of Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has said an attempt to seize power illegally and by force is under way in the country. Hours later, an army unit known as CAPSAT claimed that it had taken over the leadership of the military command, and was now in control of all the armed forces - land, air, and naval. This is the same unit that played a crucial role in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which helped Rajoelina rise to power. Madagascar was first hit by youth-led protests on 25 September against water and power cuts, but they have escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nRajoelina's whereabouts are unclear, but in a statement he said \"there is an attempt to seize power at this time in the territory of the Republic, in complete violation of the Constitution and democratic principles,\" in a translation. He condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" what he called an attempt to destabilise the country. He also called on all of the nation's key forces to unite in defending the constitutional order and national sovereignty. Rajoelina is due to address the nation at 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT), but it is unclear what he will say. CAPSAT said it had appointed a new army chief of staff, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, according to a statement issued on its Facebook page. AFP news agency reports armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo has accepted the appointment. \"I give him my blessing,\" the minister was quoted as saying at a ceremony to install Gen Pikulas to the post. My one-month-old grandson was killed by police tear gas during Madagascar protests On Monday morning, the disruption caused by the protests seemed to have eased in the capital, Antananarivo. Almost all shops in the city centre have opened. Likewise, markets and street vendors have resumed business. Protesters gathered at the city's main square, on Saturday and Sunday. This is a significant development, as they had failed to reach May 13 Square, the focal point of previous uprisings, until now. A protester told the BBC that they had \"finally conquered May 13 Square - the Square of Democracy\". \"We're happy and relieved. It's a great victory. We won't stop the struggle until President Rajoelina resigns,\" the protester added.\n\nProtesters have been celebrating their success in reaching the main square in Antananarivo\n\nThe success of the demonstrators came after they received unexpected support from CAPSAT on Saturday, when some of its troops left their barracks to join the demonstration. CAPSAT had condemned the use of force against protesters by other security units. There were reports of a shoot-out at a CAPSAT camp on Sunday, following similar reports on Saturday. CAPSAT said one soldier was shot by gendarmes on Saturday, and died. Air France said it had suspended its flights to Antananarivo until at least Tuesday because of the security situation. The African Union said it was deeply concerned by the latest developments in Madagascar, and urged sides to resolve the crisis through dialogue. The protest movement, known as Gen Z Mada, has been rallying support mainly through social media, posing the biggest challenge to Rajoelina since his re-election in 2023. Some of the protesters have been wearing T-shirts and holding banners with a symbol - a skull with a straw hat from the Japanese manga series \"One Piece\" - used by youth-led demonstrators in other countries, including Indonesia and Peru. On Saturday, a statement from the presidency had assured the nation that Rajoelina and the new prime minister - an army general he appointed last week - were in control of the situation.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Some soldiers left their barracks to throw their weight behind the protest movement\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk previously urged security forces to stop using \"unnecessary and disproportionate force\" to quell the unrest. He said at least 22 people were killed and 100 others injured. Rajoelina disputed the figure last week, saying there were 12 confirmed deaths and \"all of these individuals were looters and vandals\". Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina come to power. Rajoelina governed for four years and then returned to power after the 2018 election. Despite its natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. Only about one-third of Madagascar's 30 million people have access to electricity, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nEPA / Shutterstock The security forces have been accused of using excessive force against protesters\n\nMore on Madagascar's crisis:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

      "content": "Madagascar’s prime minister called for calm after an elite group of soldiers joined thousands of protesters against the country’s president on the streets of the capital on Saturday afternoon.\n\nProtesters marched alongside soldiers from the Capsat unit, who drove armoured vehicles, some waving Madagascar flags, from their base in Soanierana in the south of Antananarivo.\n\nA Capsat leader, Lylison René de Rolland, then addressed the cheering crowds in front of the city hall in 13 May Square, which protesters had previously been prevented from reaching. Capsat soldiers brought the current president, Andry Rajoelina, to power in a coup in 2009.\n\nSpeaking on state television on Saturday night, the prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, said the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”.\n\nRajoelina appointed Zafisambo and a new defence and security minister after dissolving the previous government last week in response to the protests.\n\nThe soldiers’ intervention ratcheted up pressure on Rajoelina, who demonstrators have been demanding stand down. The youth-led protests broke out on 25 September, initially over water and electricity cuts. However, they quickly widened into calls for a complete overhaul of the political system, with the gen Z protesters not placated by Rajoelina firing his government last week.\n\nEarlier in the day, police fired stun grenades and teargas to try to disperse the protesters. The recently appointed minister of the armed forces also called on troops to “remain calm”, at a press conference on Saturday.\n\n“We call on our brothers who disagree with us to prioritise dialogue,” minister general Deramasinjaka Manantsoa Rakotoarivelo said. “The Malagasy army remains a mediator and constitutes the nation’s last line of defence.”\n\nHowever, a Capsat leader accompanied by a large group of soldiers called on other military units to “refuse orders to shoot your friends”, in a video that was posted on social media before they left their barracks.\n\n“Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters,” he said, also calling on soldiers at the airport to “prevent all aircraft from taking off”.\n\n“Close the gates and await our instructions,” he said. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades-in-arms, because they will not take care of our families if we die.”\n\nNothing has been posted on the president’s social media accounts since Friday evening, when he was pictured meeting the heads of 10 of the country’s universities to discuss improving students’ lives.\n\nAn activist who attended Saturday’s demonstrations said she was concerned about the involvement of Capsat, due to their role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power. She also criticised politicians who made brief addresses to the crowds in front of the city hall as “opportunists”.\n\n“That’s why I’m not rejoicing at all, because all of those people gravitating around this ‘event’ are all dangerous,” said the activist, who didn’t want to be named for fear for her safety.\n\nA member of Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people that has helped to coordinate the protests, also expressed doubts about what would happen next. “We are very happy, but a lot is happening [and] we don’t want another corrupted person to take the power here, so we will do everything to have the right to choose who to put up there,” he said.\n\nAgence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report",

      "content": "Cameroon goes to the polls on Sunday for a presidential election with Paul Biya, already the world’s oldest head of state at the age of 92, the favourite to win an eighth term in power in the central African country.\n\nA fractured opposition of 11 candidates is standing against Biya, who, despite his advanced age and declining health, has dismissed calls for him to retire.\n\n“Our candidate is in great shape ... and he is capable of continuing what he has started,” Grégoire Owona, the labour minister and the ruling party’s secretary general, told French radio RFI in late September.\n\nMany of the 7.8 million Cameroonians eligible to vote can remember no leader other than Biya, who has held on to the presidency with an iron fist since 1982.\n\nThe vote is taking place against the backdrop of political stagnation, a cost of living crisis and social unrest. Opposition parties have accused the electoral commission, Elections Cameroon, of being subservient to the ruling party, and the most credible opposition candidate, Maurice Kamto, has had his candidacy barred by the courts.\n\nOther candidates include former ministers Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who recently defected from the presidential camp and has gathered several thousand people at meetings around the country, and Bello Bouba Maigari, who was Biya’s first prime minister in 1982. Observers say their individual campaigns lacked the cohesion necessary to mount a significant challenge to Biya’s long-standing rule.\n\nCameroon faces significant socioeconomic challenges; a third of the population lives on less than $2 (£1.50) a day, youth unemployment is rampant, and many young people have expressed disillusionment with the electoral process, citing a lack of economic opportunities and political representation.\n\nView image in fullscreen Supporter of opposition politician Issa Tchiroma Bakary, one of the candidates contesting Sunday’s poll. Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters\n\nVoter turnout has declined dramatically over the years, exacerbated by ongoing conflicts with jihadists in the Far North region and anglophone separatists in the west.\n\nThe latter crisis, which began in 2017, has led to thousands of deaths in the country’s two English-speaking regions and forcibly displaced over 700,000 people.\n\nKah Wallah, the leader of the Cameroon People’s party and founder of the Stand Up For Cameroon movement, said the anglophone crisis is one of the reasons why the movement has not supported elections since 2018. “We still believe it is unconscionable for the Biya regime to go to elections without ensuring the security of citizens in #NOSO,” she said, referring to a common abbreviation for Cameroon’s anglophone North-West and South-West regions.\n\nThe government has been criticised for its heavy handed response, which has left many in the anglophone regions feeling marginalised and open to boycotting the vote.\n\nBiya, who is rarely seen in public, held his first and only campaign rally on Tuesday. Addressing a crowd of supporters at a stadium in the Far North town of Maroua, he promised to step up security in the region, curb youth unemployment, and improve road infrastructure and social amenities if reelected.\n\n“I am well aware of the problems that concern you, I know the unfulfilled expectations that make you doubt the future,” Biya said in his speech. “Based on my own experience, I can assure you that these problems are not insurmountable.”\n\nThis year’s election cycle has featured striking appeals for him to step aside. First came the Catholic archbishop Samuel Kleda, who went on French radio last Christmas to say it was “not realistic” for Biya to keep doing the job. Then came the defections of Tchiroma and Maigari, both of whom openly challenged Biya’s fitness to lead.\n\nFinally, the president’s daughter Brenda Biya, 27, said on TikTok last month that her father “has made too many people suffer” and urged Cameroonians not to vote for him. She later recanted, but the post continues to circulate widely among Biya’s detractors.\n\nTheophile, an artist in the economic capital, Douala, called the vote a “scam”. The 24-year-old had hoped to vote for Kamto, who came second to Biya in the 2018 election. “As long as the system remains in place, there is nothing that can be done. There has to be a change,” he said.\n\nAgence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "content": "'In an instant, they were gone': Small town mourns after Tennessee explosives factory blast\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu Bucksnort, Tennessee Share Save\n\nBBC Mourners gather for a vigil at the Maple Valley Baptist Church in Tennessee in memory of 16 people presumed dead after a blast at an explosives factory\n\nIn Bucksnort, Tennessee, residents have spent a chilly autumn night heeding a simple message spraypainted on a concrete barrier by the side of the road: \"Pray for the AES families\". Community members gathered on Saturday for a candlelit vigil outside the Maple Valley Baptist Church after a blast at local explosives factory Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) left 16 people presumed dead. This community of Hickman and Humphreys Counties is \"not huge, so that's a lot of people to lose in an instant,\" Deacon Danny Bates said to the approximately 40 attendees, who comforted each other and sang hymns such as \"It Is Well With My Soul\". \"It was just another day at work, and then in an instant, they were gone. We have unanswered questions\".\n\nA concrete barrier on the side of a road reads \"Pray for AES families\".\n\nVigil-goer Jerri Newcombe said her friend of more than 20 years was among the victims. The two met when Newcombe's granddaughter and the victim's daughter became close as little girls. \"They grew up together - we were in each other's homes,\" Newcombe told the BBC at the vigil. \"We celebrated birthdays together. It's just surreal, because she's gone and her babies are hurting,\" she said, referring to the victim's children and grandchildren. Local police have not publicly identified any of the unaccounted-for victims, who authorities presume have all been killed. Her friend was \"full of life\", Ms Newcombe said. \"She was the type of person that could make you laugh over anything, but you didn't cross her either, or she would tear into you,\" Ms. Newcombe added amid tears and laughter, as her granddaughter comforted her. Bucksnort is a close-knit town where the cell service is spotty and a gas station - adorned with a Confederate flag centrepiece - is the local watering hole, residents say. This tragedy has hit the area hard as the community mourns family, friends, neighbours and coworkers. The town had been holding out hope for good news after the explosion on Friday morning shook homes across the area, clouded the skies with smoke and drew a surge of hundreds of state and national first responders to an otherwise sleepy community tucked behind forests along a busy motorway. But after nearly two days with no sign of survivors and the explosion site still considered dangerous for first responders, even the previously optimistic Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the time had come to switch to a recovery - rather than rescue - strategy. \"At some point in time, we have got to rip off the Band-Aid,\" Davis, who has held back tears at news conferences, said. \"We are dealing with remains.\" Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft told the BBC on Saturday night that rapid DNA analysis was still ongoing, but that after a search by 300 first responders, authorities had enough confidence in their assessment of the scene to notify families that their loved ones were likely deceased. No cause of the blast has yet been identified, and agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are investigating. It could take as long as a month for federal investigators to reach the main site of the explosion, ATF official Brice McCracken told the BBC. The volatile nature of the explosive materials has also hampered the emergency response, officials said, as controlled detonations to render the site safe are also expected in the coming days.\n\nWatch: Tennessee town comes together to confront tragedy",

Photograph: Angela Ponce/Reuters\n\n“Today, I humbly assume the presidency of the republic ... in order to install and lead a transitional government,” Jerí told parliament after being sworn in.\n\nProtests have marked Boluarte’s presidency, along with various scandals, investigations and a rise in gang violence. She had already faced down several attempts to remove her from office.\n\nThe latest effort cited her “permanent moral incapacity” to carry out her duties since assuming office in December 2022.\n\nPeru has had six presidents in about nine years.\n\nBoluarte, who took office after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, was impeached after trying to suspend congress – leading to protests that killed at least 50 people – had seen her approval rating plummet.\n\nView image in fullscreen A woman holds a sign reading ‘Dina out’ in Lima after Peru’s Congress voted unanimously to remove Boluarte from office.

      "content": "Militia drone and artillery strikes have killed at least 60 people at a displacement shelter in the besieged city of El Fasher in western Sudan, a local activist group has said.\n\nThe resistance committee for El Fasher said the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group hit the Dar al-Arqam displacement centre, which is in the grounds of a university.\n\nBodies remained trapped in the rubble, the committee said in a statement, describing it as a “massacre” and calling on the international community to intervene. It said in a later statement that the shelter had been hit twice by drones and eight times by artillery shells on Friday and Saturday.\n\n“Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,” said the committee, which is part of a group of activists who coordinate aid and document abuses in the conflict. “The situation has gone beyond disaster and genocide inside the city, and the world remains silent.”\n\nA separate medical group, called the Sudan Doctors’ Network, gave a figure of 53 people killed in the strikes, including 14 children and 15 women.\n\nThe RSF has been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces in a civil war since April 2023. Its militants have put El Fasher under siege for more than 500 days and families there are starving.\n\nEl Fasher – home to 400,000 people – is the last state capital in the region of Darfur that has not been taken by the RSF. It has become a strategic front in the war as the paramilitaries attempt to consolidate control in the west.\n\nThe UN has described the Sudan war as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century. More than 150,000 people have been killed and more than 14 million displaced. Nearly 25 million people have been forced into acute hunger.\n\nCountrywide fighting, fuelled by international powers, has raged in the absence of an effective global effort to end the bloodshed.\n\nOn Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said he was “appalled by the RSF’s endless and wanton disregard for civilian life” in El Fasher.\n\nHe said: “Despite repeated calls, including my own, for specific care to be taken to protect civilians, they continue instead to kill, injure and displace civilians, and to attack civilian objects, including [internally displaced people’s] shelters, hospitals and mosques, with total disregard for international law. This must end.”\n\nSudan’s current conflict erupted in 2023, but is part of decades of violence. On Monday, the international criminal court took its first action against a suspect of crimes in Darfur when it convicted a leader of a militia for atrocities committed there more than 20 years ago.\n\nAli Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, also known by the nom de guerre Ali Kushayb, was accused of being a leader of the Janjaweed militia, a group from which the RSF developed.\n\nThe former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir is also wanted by the ICC on genocide charges.\n\nTürk said the RSF, and all parties to the conflict, should “draw lessons from this week’s conviction of Ali Kushayb”.\n\nReuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

      "content": "The Venezuelan opposition politician María Corina Machado has won the Nobel peace prize for her dogged struggle to rescue the South American country from its fate as “a brutal, authoritarian state”.\n\nMachado, 58, a conservative often described as Venezuela’s Iron Lady, has spent the last year living in hiding after her political movement was widely believed to have beaten the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, in the July 2024 presidential election.\n\nMaduro refused to accept he had lost to Machado’s ally, the former diplomat Edmundo González, and launched a ferocious political crackdown that forced González into exile and Machado to go underground.\n\nIn one of her last public appearances in Caracas, Machado said she was convinced Maduro’s days in power were numbered after his apparently stinging defeat. “I would say his departure is irreversible,” she told the Guardian.\n\nMore than a year later Maduro remains in power and, crucially, has retained the support of Venezuela’s military and key international backers such as China and Russia. Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast in recent weeks, which some suspect could be a prelude to some kind of regime change operation.\n\n1:51 Who is María Corina Machado,'Venezuela’s Iron Lady' and new Nobel peace prize winner? – video\n\nMachado reacted to her Nobel prize in a video that González posted on social media in which the pair celebrate the news. “I can’t believe it! My God!” an incredulous Machado tells her ally. “It’s fucking incredible!” replies González.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Institute shared a video of the moment its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, woke up Machado with the news. “Oh my God!” she said. “I have no words … But I hope you understand that … I am just one person, I certainly don’t deserve this.”\n\n“It caught her totally by surprise,” said Pedro Mario Burelli, an opposition politician and friend of more than four decades. “She’s very moved. She’s very concerned about what impact this has on the last phase of the struggle. She’s tearful,” he added, shortly after speaking to Machado on Friday morning.\n\nWriting on X, Machado dedicated the prize to “the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”\n\nShe said the prize was “an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer freedom”. “We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve freedom and democracy.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Machado in Caracas during the 2024 election campaign. Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters\n\nThe Nobel committee celebrated Machado’s long struggle for democracy in a statement that called her “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times”.\n\nIt also paid tribute to the Venezuelan opposition’s “innovative and brave, peaceful and democratic” push for change during last year’s election, when hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised to observe the election and collect detailed tallies showing that González had won.\n\n“But the regime refused to accept the election result, and clung to power,” the committee said, painting a dire picture of life in Venezuela, which has gradually sunk into dictatorship since Maduro was democratically elected in 2013 after the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez.\n\n“Venezuela has evolved from a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal, authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis,” the committee said.\n\n“Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty, even as the few at the top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against the country’s own citizens. Nearly 8 million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution and imprisonment.”\n\nMachado, whom many Venezuelans know simply as MCM or María Corina, has been involved in politics for more than two decades and was a member of Venezuela’s national assembly from 2011 to 2014. She famously clashed with Chávez over Venezuela’s economic tribulations in 2012, earning the rebuke: “Eagles don’t hunt flies.”\n\nBut it was in touring the economically devastated country by car and motorbike in the lead-up to the 2024 election that she cemented her reputation as Chavismo’s most effective and influential adversary.\n\nHer rallies drew huge, ecstatic crowds, with many supporters declaring an almost religious devotion to the charismatic Catholic politician, who promised to reunite millions of Venezuelan families separated by the mass migration triggered by Venezuela’s economic meltdown under Maduro.\n\n“She connected with people on the one issue that matters to people – which is family,” said Burelli, noting how Machado’s relatives had also been forced to flee abroad. “Everybody understands that she is in the same boat.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Machado addressing supporters at a protest in January. Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/Reuters\n\nMachado had originally hoped to run for president, but Venezuela’s pro-regime supreme court banned her from doing so, leaving González, a little-known former ambassador, to fill her shoes.\n\n“She will go down in history as the great opposition leader of our times … whether she makes it to the presidency or not,” said Carlos Lizarralde, the author of Venezuela’s Collapse: The Long Story of How Things Fell Apart​.\n\nThe committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who had kept “the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”. It also celebrated her as “a key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided”.\n\nFor all her popular support, however, Machado is not universally liked. Some Venezuelans distrust her as a result of thinly veiled calls for a foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro in the past. She argued in 2019 that only a “a real, credible severe and imminent threat” of the use of international force would convince Maduro to leave power.\n\nDavid Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela specialist, said: “María Corina Machado has shown incredible courage in fighting for democracy. In 2023-24 she heroically mobilised the Venezuelan population for presidential elections. However, much of her fight before then and since then has been through non-democratic means, seeking to generate international military intervention.”\n\nOthers are suspicious of her ties to radical rightwing politicians such as Trump and Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, and her support for Trump’s widely discredited claim that a Venezuelan gang, the Tren de Aragua – has launched an “invasion” of the US.\n\nTrump and top officials such as Stephen Miller have used that spurious claim as justification for its campaign against Venezuelan migrants – scores of whom were deported to a high-security prison in authoritarian El Salvador – and for strikes on alleged “narco-boats” in the Caribbean that have killed at least 21 people.\n\nMaduro and his allies mockingly refer to Machado as “La Sayona” [“the sackcloth woman”] – the name of a hideous female ghost from Venezuelan folklore who roams the country taking violent revenge on unfaithful husbands.\n\nChristopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House, said Maduro would be furious at the Nobel committee’s decision. “The question is, what now? Will it prompt public demonstrations in favour of María Corina Machado that [heap] some sort of public pressure on the government? Perhaps,” he said.\n\n“I think they would be hard-pressed to crack down with the international community [watching], but they did it in July 2024.”\n\nBurelli said he believed the award would shield his friend from possible arrest or persecution as she continued her fight for change. “This now truly protects her,” he said, arguing that the cost of targeting her would be “unbearable” for Maduro’s regime. “Now, I think she is bulletproof.”",

      "content": "Madagascar’s president said an “attempt to seize power illegally and by force” was under way, as an elite military unit that joined protesters on the streets on Saturday announced it was taking over the army.\n\nThe Capsat unit’s intervention comes after weeks of youth-led protests, which started on 25 September against water and electricity shortages and expanded to calling for the resignation of the president, Andry Rajoelina, an end to corruption and radical overhaul of the political system.\n\nRajoelina said he was “in the country … managing national affairs”, in a statement released on Sunday morning. The newly appointed prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, had said on state television on Saturday night that the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”.\n\nRajoelina said: “The presidency of the republic wishes to inform the nation and the international community that an attempt to seize power illegally and by force, contrary to the constitution and to democratic principles, is currently under way.”\n\nSoldiers from Capsat , which brought Rajoelina to power in a coup in 2009, said on Sunday morning that they were taking command of the military, according to a videoed statement shared by local news organisations.\n\nLater on Sunday, General Demosthene Pikulas, the head of Capsat, was installed as chief of the army staff during a ceremony at the army headquarters attended by armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo.\n\n“I give him my blessing,” the minister said of Pikulas.\n\nPikulas admitted to journalists after the ceremony that events in Madagascar over the past few days had been “unpredictable”.\n\n“So the army has a responsibility to restore calm and peace throughout Madagascar,” he said.\n\nWhen asked if he called for Rajoelina to resign, he refused to “discuss politics within a military facility”.\n\nOn Saturday, Capsat said it would not fire on protesters and called on the rest of the military to “join forces” in refusing. Late in the afternoon, members of the unit left their base in Soanierana district, in the south of the capital, Antananarivo, driving in armoured vehicles to the symbolic May 13 Square, about 3 miles to the north, accompanied by thousands of cheering protesters.\n\nA Capsat general said on Saturday that one of their soldiers had been killed by the gendarmerie, police under the command of the defence ministry, and a journalist had been shot in the buttocks. The UN said at least 22 people were killed at the start of the protests in September, but Rajoelina disputed this last week, saying 12 “looters and vandals” had died.\n\nThe protests on the Indian Ocean island of around 32 million people were initially coordinated by Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people who had been inspired by similar “gen Z” protests in Indonesia and Nepal, where the government was overthrown.\n\nRajoelina fired his government on 29 September in response to the initial demonstrations. However, Gen Z Madagascar rejected this as insufficient, calling for the resignation of the president, as well as the leader of parliament and constitutional court judges, while protesters on the streets continued to shout, “Miala Rajoelina!” (Leave Rajoelina!).\n\nSome young activists expressed concern on Saturday about Capsat’s intervention, with one calling the soldiers, and opposition politicians who joined them in May 13 Square, “dangerous”.\n\nMadagascar is one of the world’s poorest countries, with a GDP per capita of just $545 last year, according to the World Bank. The precious gem- and vanilla-rich nation was ranked 140 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2024 corruption perceptions index.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report",

      "content": "In a corner of the new Museum of West African Art, visitors can marvel at a sample display of the cultural treasures that adorned the royal palace that once stood in its place: a proud cockerel, a plaque with three mighty warriors, a bust of a king with a glorious beaded collar.\n\nThe artefacts, collectively known as the Benin bronzes, were looted by British colonial forces who went on to burn down the palace in a punitive expedition in 1897. In the decades that followed they were scattered across collections in Europe and America.\n\nView image in fullscreen Neil Curtis, head of collections at the University of Aberdeen, with a bronze sculpture depicting an oba (king) of Benin in 2021. Photograph: Courtesy of University of Aberdeen\n\nTheir return and public display inside the $25m (£19m) state-of-the-art museum in the city of Benin in Nigeria’s Edo state, co-funded by European governments and western enterprises, was to be the crowning moment of an almost century-long effort to reclaim Africa’s stolen art.\n\nYet when MOWAA opens its doors on 11 November, the only Benin bronzes on display will be clay replicas – a far cry from the “most comprehensive display [of Benin bronzes] in the world” touted by authorities when plans for the museum to become their home were announced in 2020.\n\nAbout 150 original bronzes have been returned to Nigeria over the last five years, some on the initiative of private collections and some as acts of state by Germany and the Netherlands. For now, none are on public display.\n\nIf the looting of the original bronzes took place in the context of what has been called the “scramble for Africa”, as European nations raced to claim overseas territories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, restitution has in part resembled a scramble in reverse. Western actors tried to outbid each other to atone for their past, before authorities in Nigeria had settled old rivalries about what restitution precisely entailed.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benin Bronzes on display at the Humboldt Forum in Berlin in May. Photograph: NurPhoto SRL/Alamy\n\n“In the west, there was a race about who was going to be the first institution to restitute,” said MOWAA’s director and chair Phillip Ihenacho, without naming individual museums or governments. “And there was not enough of a focus on to whom they would be restituted to.\n\n“I think that there was a well-intentioned effort that was focused very much around being seen to be a pioneer in this area. But a lot of people in the west failed to understand the complexities within those countries.”\n\nNigerian demands for the Benin bronzes’ return, first voiced in the 1930s, were widely shunned by western governments and institutions until 2007, when a consortium of European museums and Nigerian officials formed the Benin Dialogue group.\n\nOn the Nigerian side, the group included not just representatives of the federal Nigerian government, but also of Edo state, where the kingdom of Benin was once located, and of Ewuare II, the descendant of the royal family that once owned the bronzes, known as the Oba of Benin.\n\nWhich of these three parties were entitled to the bronzes upon their return has historically been a bone of contention. The Oba has argued that since they were looted from the palace, they should be returned to the descendants and not to Edo state.\n\nEuropean participants in the discussions were of the impression that the conflict on the Nigerian side had been settled.\n\nRace to return\n\nIn November 2019, the group invited Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye to come up with plans for a new museum where the returned treasures could be stored and put on public display. Still, to the frustration of officials in Nigeria and activists in Europe, there were no concrete announcements on physical returns.\n\nThe spring of 2021 was to provide a sudden step-change. In a March interview with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the director of Berlin’s newly opened Humboldt Forum let slip that the museum was considering leaving symbolic empty spaces where it had intended to display Benin bronzes from its collection, with the originals returning to Nigeria.\n\nThe comment surprised German government officials, who were in west Africa to discuss repatriations with their Nigerian counterparts, and set high expectations among the public and other organisations.\n\nA flurry of activity followed: days later, Aberdeen University in Scotland announced it would also return a pillaged bronze. Then similar declarations were made by the Horniman museum in London, Cambridge University, New York’s Met and the Rhode Island School of Design’s art museum.\n\nMuseum officials suggest the pace of these developments was also fanned by the Nigerian cultural heritage agency, whose representatives were jetting around the world to strike return deals.\n\nIn December 2022, a German state delegation travelled to Nigeria with 21 bronzes packaged in crates in the belly of the government plane, an initiative pushed for by the then foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, of the German Green party, who was eager to make her mark a year into office. “It could and should have been a lot less hectic,” said one official directly involved in preparing the trip.\n\nView image in fullscreen Nigerian culture minister, Layiwola ‘Lai’ Mohammed (R), and German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, signing an agreement of intent to return the Benin bronzes to Nigeria in Berlin in the summer of 2022. Photograph: Adam Berry/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt a handover ceremony in Abuja, Baerbock said Germany was proud to co-finance MOWAA to the tune of €6.8m (£6m), and “invited” her counterpart to exhibit the bronzes there. It was a grand, pathos-filled moment but underneath the surface, tensions that the Europeans believed had been laid to rest were bubbling up again. Present at the ceremony were ministers of the federal Nigerian government and representatives of Edo state, but not the Oba.\n\nView image in fullscreen People photographing the returned artefacts at the Nigerian foreign ministry during the handover ceremony in December 2022. Photograph: Kola Sulaimon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was a personal flavour to the animosity: Godwin Obaseki, the then governor of Edo state, is a direct descendant of a former palace official who had been named Benin prime minister by the British after the punitive expedition and is still seen in some circles as a betrayer of the kingdom. Media outlets loyal to the palace accused Obaseki of having set up MOWAA in order to hijack the restitution process, calling for its occupancy licence to be revoked.\n\nView image in fullscreen Godwin Obaseki. Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy\n\nThe tussle over the bronzes was ended in an abrupt fashion on 23 March 2023, when Nigeria’s federal government announced in an official gazette that the Oba of Benin was the stolen treasures’ rightful owner and custodian, and that they must be stored within his residence in Benin City unless the royal family decided otherwise.\n\nThe move caused howls of outrage among those in Europe who had been sceptical of the restitution in the first place. Centre-right German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it “a fiasco”, suggesting that the bronzes would be locked away in the Oba’s private residence with no access for the public.\n\nThis is unlikely to be the case: a former cultural centre adjacent to the Oba’s residence is rumoured to be earmarked as a designated future museum. “The new name will be Benin Royal museum and this is where they plan to store the bronzes,” said Benin-born Mercy Imiegha, director of Lagos-based Nomadic Art Gallery.\n\nAt any rate, inter-Nigerian disputes should not deflect from the urgent need for the bronzes’ return, say restitution advocates. “The Benin bronzes in German museums would never have found their way to Europe if British forces hadn’t invaded the Benin Kingdom and sacked the royal palace,” said Barbara Plankensteiner, director of Hamburg’s Museum am Rothenbaum and co-spokesperson of the Benin Dialogue group. “We are looking at the largest theft of a royal treasure in history. There was a moral imperative for them to be returned to Africa with no strings attached.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Benin bronzes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Photograph: Art2010/Alamy\n\nAndreas Goergen, a former secretary general of the German Federal Ministry for Culture and the Media, said: “Dealing with the art objects of traditional rulers is difficult for any republic. Germany took 100 years to reach an agreement with the Hohenzollerns [the German imperial dynasty that was overthrown at the end of the first world war]. Nigeria took four to reach an agreement with the Oba of Benin. So, no reason to be snooty.”\n\n“The Europeans can’t tell us what we should or shouldn’t do with the objects of our heritage,” said Toyin Akinosho, co-founder of the nonprofit Committee for Relevant Art, which organises the Lagos Book and Arts festival. “Can’t we hold conversations here too about programming of new culture spaces?”\n\nMOWAA, meanwhile, has had to readjust. Originally supposed to be called the Edo Museum of West African Art, it decided to remove the name of the state to emphasise its impartiality.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Museum of West African Art. Photograph: Museum of West African Art (MOWAA)\n\n“We had hoped that we would be able to provide support to the restitution effort by demonstrating that we have institutions in West Africa that have what the west would regard as world-class display and storage facilities,” said Ihenacho. “But we never were set up to be the exclusive Benin bronzes museum.”\n\nOne space will host an exhibition about the archaeological dig carried out on the MOWAA site with £3m in support from London’s British Museum, which still holds the largest single collection of looted Benin bronzes in the world.\n\nA selection of about 100 artefacts will hint at the story of the kingdom of Benin and its dissolution. “Some of them may well be made of bronze,” said Ihenacho. “But there will be nothing that was involved in the restitution process.”",

      "content": "Renewed fighting between rival leaders forces mass exodus across South Sudan’s borders as fears of wider war rise.\n\nClick here to share on social media\n\nAbout 300,000 people have fled South Sudan so far in 2025 as armed conflict between rival leaders threatens civil war, the United Nations warns.\n\nThe mass displacement was reported on Monday by the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan. The report cautioned that the conflict between President Salva Kiir and suspended First Vice President Riek Machar risks a return to full-scale war.\n\nThe commission’s report called for an urgent regional intervention to prevent the country from sliding towards such a tragic event.\n\nSouth Sudan has been beset by political instability and ethnic violence since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011.\n\nThe country plunged into civil war in 2013 when Kiir dismissed Machar as vice president. The pair agreed a ceasefire in 2017, but their fragile power-sharing agreement has been unravelling for months and was suspended last month amid outbreaks of violence among forces loyal to each.\n\nMachar was placed under house arrest in March after fighting between the military and an ethnic Nuer militia in the northeastern town of Nasir killed dozens of people and displaced more than 80,000.\n\nHe was charged with treason, murder and crimes against humanity in September although his lawyer argued the court lacked jurisdiction. Kiir suspended Machar from his position in early October.\n\nMachar rejects the charges with his spokesman calling them a “political witch-hunt”.\n\nRenewed clashes in South Sudan have driven almost 150,000 people to Sudan, where a civil war has raged for two years, and a similar number into neighbouring Uganda, Ethiopia and as far as Kenya.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 2.5 million South Sudanese refugees now live in neighbouring countries while two million remain internally displaced.\n\nThe commission linked the current crisis to corruption and lack of accountability among South Sudan’s leaders.\n\n“The ongoing political crisis, increasing fighting and unchecked, systemic corruption are all symptoms of the failure of leadership,” Commissioner Barney Afako said.\n\n“The crisis is the result of deliberate choices made by its leaders to put their interests above those of their people,” Commission Chairwoman Yasmin Sooka said.\n\nA UN report in September detailed significant corruption, alleging that $1.7bn from an oil-for-roads programme remains unaccounted for while three-quarters of the country faces severe food shortages.\n\nCommissioner Barney Afako warned that without immediate regional engagement, South Sudan risks catastrophic consequences.\n\n“South Sudanese are looking to the African Union and the region to rescue them from a preventable fate,” he said.",

      "content": "Colombia’s president has drawn Washington’s ire after accusing the US of killing Colombian citizens during a recent boat strike in the Caribbean Sea.\n\n“A new theatre of war has opened up: the Caribbean,” Gustavo Petro wrote on his official X account on Wednesday night.\n\nThe US has launched at least four deadly aerial attacks on alleged drug trafficking boats crossing the waterway since early September, when 11 people were killed in the first strike.\n\nThe South American country’s leftwing leader claimed there were “indications” that the most recently destroyed boat was Colombian “and had Colombians onboard”.\n\n“I hope their families come forwards to report this,” added Petro, a fierce critic of Donald Trump, without offering further details or evidence.\n\nSince the US began its strikes in the Caribbean at least 21 people have reportedly lost their lives. On Friday, the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said four “narco-terrorists” were killed in international waters “just off the coast of Venezuela” as they transported “substantial amounts of [US-bound] narcotics”.\n\nHowever, the names of those killed on the supposed “narco-boats” have not been released and Trump officials have failed to provide any proof that the victims were involved in smuggling drugs to the US.\n\nThe White House pushed back against Petro’s claims, demanding he publicly retract “his baseless and reprehensible statement” about the boat attack. But two US officials, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly, told the New York Times that Colombians were on at least one of the boats recently destroyed by the US.\n\nPetro urged the White House to release the names of those killed by US strikes “so I can see if my information is unfounded”.\n\nWashington claims its strikes – which are part of a major military buildup in the Caribbean Sea – are part of a large-scale crackdown on Venezuelan narco groups it accuses of flooding the US with cocaine.\n\nHowever, the decision to deploy warships and thousands of marines off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast has left many observers many wondering if the operation is actually a pretext to depose Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\n“The deployment is vastly disproportionate to any real counter-narcotics mission. So this really looks, walks and talks like a regime change preparation,” Juan González, the White House’s former top Latin America official, told CNN this week.\n\nGonzález, who served under Joe Biden, said that by some estimates “roughly 10% of naval assets” had been sent to the region.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maduro, who Trump failed to topple during his first term, warned that his troops were preparing for a possible attempt at regime change. “If the gringos attack, we will respond.”\n\nVenezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said he was braced for a variety of scenarios including drone attacks, an air campaign or acts of sabotage or targeted assassinations carried out by US special forces.\n\nWriting on Wednesday, Petro claimed “the war” playing out in the Caribbean Sea was not about drug smuggling but oil, a commodity of which Venezuela boasts the world’s largest reserves. “The world must stop this,” Petro added. “This aggression is aimed at the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean.”\n\nOn Thursday, Grenada’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it ha​d received a request from the US for the “temporary installation of radar equipment and associated technical personnel”. The confirmation followed days of speculation by local media that the US was going to ask the country to host military assets to help with their operations in the southern Caribbean.\n\nWhile some Caribbean nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, have welcomed the US’s military presence in the region, others have described it as a threat to peace and security.\n\nThe Venezuela-backed Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America trade bloc, of which Grenada is a member, had condemned the US deployment of warships as a “flagrant violation” of international law. In its statement, Grenada said it was carefully reviewing the request and would only make a decision after “technical and legal assessments”.",

      "description": "Israel destroyed or made inaccessible 98.5 percent of Gaza&#039;s agricultural land. My family&#039;s olive grove is part of it.",
      "content": "Last week, a ceasefire was announced after two years of genocide in Gaza. The bombs have stopped falling, but the devastation remains. The majority of homes, schools, hospitals, universities, factories, and commercial buildings have been reduced to rubble. From above, Gaza looks like a grey desert of rubble, its vibrant urban spaces reduced to ghost towns, its lush agricultural land and greenery wiped out.\n\nThe occupier’s aim was not only to render the Palestinians of Gaza homeless but also unable to provide for themselves. Uprooting the dispossessed and impoverished, those who have lost their connection to the land, is of course much easier.\n\nThis was the goal when Israeli tanks and bulldozers entered my family’s plot of land in the eastern part of Maghazi refugee camp and uprooted 55 olive trees, 10 palms and five fig trees.\n\nThis plot of land was offered to my refugee grandfather, Ali Alsaloul, by its original owner as a place to shelter in during the Nakba of 1948. Ali, his wife, Ghalia, and their children had just fled their village, al-Maghar, as Zionist forces advanced on it. Al-Maghar, like Gaza today, was reduced to rubble; the Zionists who perpetrated the crime completed the erasure by establishing a national park on its ruins – “Mrar Hills National Park”.\n\nAli was a farmer and so were his ancestors; his livelihood had always come from the land. So when he settled in the new location, he was quick to plant it with olive trees, palms, figs and prickly pears. He built his house there and raised my father, uncles and aunts. My grandfather eventually bought the land from its generous owner, by paying in installments over many years. Thus, my family came into the possession of 2,000 square metres (half an acre) of land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough my father and his siblings married and moved out of their family home, this plot of land remained a favourite place to go, especially for me.\n\nIt was just two kilometres away from our house in Maghazi refugee camp. I enjoyed doing the 30-minute walk, part of which went through a complete “jungle”: a stretch of green populated with clover, sycamore, jujube and olive trees, colourful birds, foxes, leashed and unleashed dogs and many beehives.\n\nEvery autumn, in October, when the olive picking season began, my cousins, friends and I would gather to collect the olives. It was an occasion that brought us closer together. We would get the olives pressed and get 500 litres (130 gallons) of olive oil from the harvest. The figs and dates were made into jams to have for breakfast or for suhoor during Ramadan.\n\nThe rest of the year, I would often meet my friends Ibrahim and Mohammed between the olive trees. We would light a small fire and make a kettle of tea to enjoy under the moonlight, while we talked.\n\nWhen the war started in 2023, our land became a dangerous place to go. The farms and olive groves around it were often bombed. Our plot was also hit twice at the beginning of the war. As a result, we could not harvest the olives in 2023 and then again in 2024.\n\nWhen the famine took hold of Gaza in the summer, we started sneaking into the plot to get some fruit and some firewood for cooking, since a kilo of that cost $2. We knew that Israeli tanks might storm in at any moment, but we took the risk anyway.\n\nSeven families – we, friends and neighbours – benefited from the fruit and wood of that land.\n\nOne day in late August, a friend of mine called me with a terrible rumour he had heard: the Israeli tanks and bulldozers had advanced into the eastern part of Maghazi and levelled it all, uprooting trees and burying them. I gasped; our lifeline was gone.\n\nDays later, the rumour was confirmed. The Israeli army had uprooted more than 600 trees in the area, mostly olive trees. Those who had fled from the area shared what they had seen. What was once a lush green stretch of land had been bulldozed into a yellow, lifeless desert.\n\nEarlier in August, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported that 98.5 percent of Gaza’s agricultural land had been damaged or made inaccessible. I guess the destruction of our plot shrank that 1.5 percent remaining land even further.\n\nAs Israel was completing the erasure of Palestinian agricultural land, it started allowing commercial but not aid trucks into Gaza. The markets were flooded with products with packaging covered in Hebrew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael was starving us, destroying our ability to grow our own food, and then making us buy their products at exorbitant prices.\n\nNinety percent of people in Gaza are unemployed and can’t afford to buy an Israeli egg for $5 or a kilo of dates for $13. It was yet another genocidal strategy that forced the two million starving Palestinians in Gaza to choose between two horrible options: dying from hunger or paying to support the Israeli economy.\n\nNow, aid is finally supposed to start coming into Gaza under the ceasefire agreement. This may be a relief to many starving Palestinians, but it is not a solution. Israel has rendered us fully dependent on aid, and it is the sole power that determines if, when and how much of it enters Gaza. Per the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, 100 percent of Palestinians in Gaza experience some level of food insecurity.\n\nMuch of Gaza’s agricultural land remains out of reach, as Israel has withdrawn from just a part of the Gaza Strip. My family will have to wait for the implementation of the third phase of the ceasefire deal – if Israel agrees to implement it at all – to see the Israeli army withdraw to the buffer zone and regain access our land.\n\nWe have now lost our land twice. Once in 1948 and now again in 2025. Israel wants to repeat history and dispossess us again. It must not be allowed to convert more Palestinian land into buffer zones and national parks.\n\nGetting back our land, rehabilitating and planting it is crucial not just for our survival, but also for maintaining our connection to the land. We must resist uprooting.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

      "content": "A court in Argentina has sentenced a man to 10 years in prison after finding him guilty of attempting to kill former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.\n\nThe court in Buenos Aires also sentenced the man’s accomplice to eight years in prison, capping a dramatic case that has captivated the country since 2022, when the main defendant, Fernando Sabag Montiel, squeezed through a crowd outside the ex-president’s home, thrust a loaded gun at her face and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe gun did not go off. Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s vice-president at the time, was unharmed.\n\nThe botched assassination attempt provoked street protests from Fernández de Kirchner’s diehard supporters as well as scepticism and conspiracy theories from her fervent critics.\n\n1:07 Man points gun at Argentinian vice-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner – video\n\nAmong Latin America’s best-known politicians with three decades at the forefront of Argentinian politics and two terms as president from 2007 to 2015, Fernández de Kirchner is a deeply polarising figure whose brand of leftwing populism brought Argentina infamy for its runaway inflation and enormous fiscal deficits.\n\nConvicted of corruption for allegedly steering public roadworks contracts to a friend’s company, Fernández de Kirchner, 72, was sentenced earlier this year to six years in prison. Citing her age and safety fears since the 2022 attack, a court allowed her to serve her time under house arrest in Buenos Aires.\n\nWhile banned from running for public office, she remains outspoken against Argentina’s libertarian president, Javier Milei. From her apartment, she still posts diatribes on social media, waves at supporters gathered below her balcony and receives high-profile visitors, such as the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who visited her in July. Fernández de Kirchner has long rejected the corruption charges as politically motivated.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fernando Sabag Montiel confessed to the crime in court, describing his assassination attempt as a means to exact justice for Fernández de Kirchner’s alleged corruption. Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the trial that concluded Wednesday, prosecutors aimed to prove that Sabag Montiel, an Argentinian citizen born in Brazil, and his then girlfriend, Brenda Uliarte, planned the assassination attempt in advance.\n\nThe prosecution produced WhatsApp chats about the firearm and evidence that the former couple visited Fernández de Kirchner’s house before the attack to observe her routines and security.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Fernández de Kirchner was standing trial for corruption and crowds rallied regularly outside her home in solidarity. The former president’s supporters managed to catch Sabag Montiel as he tried to flee the scene after firing the defective gun.\n\nHe confessed to the crime in court, describing his assassination attempt as a means to exact justice for Fernández de Kirchner’s alleged corruption. Uliarte, arrested days after the incident, denied any involvement.",

      "content": "Environmental campaigners have accused New Zealand’s government of “full-blown climate denial” after it slashed targets for reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.\n\nNew Zealand’s right-leaning coalition government outlined plans on Sunday to reduce methane emissions by between 14 and 24% by 2050, compared to 2017 levels.\n\nThe previous target was between 24 and 47%.\n\nFarmers – who had taken issue with the previous target – praised the move, but scientists and opposition parties criticised it as “weak” and “unambitious”.\n\nGreenpeace’s New Zealand office said the policy shift “amounts to full-blown climate denial”.\n\nAmanda Larsson, a climate campaigner with the environmental group, said prime minister Christopher Luxon was “choosing ... corporate profits over our kids’ future”.\n\nClimate change minister Simon Watts said the government “remains committed to our domestic and international climate change commitments, including net zero by 2050.\n\n“Agriculture will continue to make an important and fair contribution to achieving this reduction,” he said.\n\nThe government also confirmed that it would conduct a legislated review of biogenic methane targets in 2040, and impose no tax on agricultural methane emissions due to the threat of farm closures.\n\nIt will also invest NZ$400m (US$230m) in methane-cutting technology.\n\nWatts said total agricultural emissions could fall by up to 14% over the next decade if 30% of farmers adopted technologies expected to be available before 2030.\n\nBut Massey University climate mitigation expert Ralph Sims said there was “no guarantee” that scientific research would provide near-term solutions to biogenic methane, which include those belched out by the country’s five million cows and 23 million sheep.\n\nAgriculture accounts for almost half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to government figures.\n\nLawyers for Climate Action, an advocacy group, said the reduced target risked tarnishing New Zealand’s international standing.\n\nJocelyn Turnbull, a principal scientist at government-funded institute Earth Sciences New Zealand, also said it could harm New Zealand’s “clean and green” image.\n\nBut Federated Farmers of New Zealand, an agricultural lobby group, said the change was “long overdue”. President Wayne Langford said previous methane reduction targets had been “absolute madness”.\n\n“Farming families have been under huge pressure for a long time now – but it looks like that’s finally coming to an end,” he said.",

      "content": "The number of babies born to foreign parents reached a record high in Japan in 2024, underlining rapid demographic changes that have propelled migration to the heart of the country’s political debate.\n\nMore than 20,000 children were born to non-Japanese couples, accounting for more than 3% of all newborns, according to the health ministry – in stark contrast to another sharp fall in the number born to Japanese parents.\n\nThe number and proportion of foreign newborns were both record highs, the Nikkei business newspaper reported, adding that the children were “starting to help dent the decline in births among Japanese people”.\n\nJapan is one of the fastest-ageing countries in the world and has struggled to raise its birthrate to the level needed to sustain the population, which currently stands at about 125 million.\n\nIts non-Japanese population has soared in recent years, as more migrant workers are hired to fill gaps in the labour market – a trend that has turned immigration into an election issue for the first time.\n\nThe ministry’s data showed that 22,878 foreign children – defined as the offspring of non-Japanese parents or an unmarried foreign mother – were born last year. That is an increase of more than 3,000 from a year earlier, and represents a 50% rise from a decade ago, the Nikkei said.\n\nThe number of children born to Japanese couples fell to 686,173 – a reduction of 41,115 from the year before. The contrasting trends meant non-Japanese newborns offset the decline in Japanese births by more than half and accounted for 3.2% of all births.\n\nBy nationality, Chinese women comprised the single biggest group of foreign mothers followed by women from the Philippines and Brazil.\n\nThe increase is a reflection of the sharp rise in foreign residents in Japan. The number of legal foreign residents has risen to 3.95 million, the immigration services agency said last week. Many are in their 20s and 30s and are more likely to remain in the country for longer and to have children.\n\nThe diverse populations now found in many Japanese towns such as Ōizumi, home to dozens of nationalities, has prompted right-wing politicians to call for stricter immigration rules and better integration.\n\nIn July’s upper house elections, the minor populist party Sanseito put in a strong performance after it campaigned opposing foreign workers.\n\nSanae Takaichi, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic party who is hoping to be made prime minister this month, made immigration and “badly behaved” foreign tourists a key part of her election bid.\n\nBut the labour shortage, combined with an ageing demographic, is expected to fuel more migration. The justice minister, Keisuke Suzuki, recently said the proportion of foreign residents could surpass 10% of the population by 2040 – three decades earlier than a National Institute of Population and Social Security Research forecast published in 2023.\n\nExperts have called on local authorities to do more to help foreign families. “Policies and help for foreign babies born here and their families are lagging in many localities, and most rely on nonprofit organisations,” Toshihiro Menju, a visiting professor at the Kansai University of International Studies, told the Nikkei.\n\n“We need policies to create a society where foreign-national children, when they grow up, speak Japanese, earn as much as Japanese citizens do, and can support their own families,” Menju aded, warning that otherwise “we are going to have a divided society”.",

      "content": "The government’s national security adviser had no involvement in the prosecution being dropped against two British men accused of spying for China, a senior cabinet minister has said.\n\nJonathan Powell had no connection to discussions about the “substance or the evidence” of the case, Bridget Phillipson said on Sunday, adding that Keir Starmer had full confidence in him.\n\nPowell’s role has been under intense scrutiny since it emerged that the sudden abandonment of the prosecution in September appeared to be because Starmer’s government was unwilling to say that China posed a threat to UK national security, a decision to which Powell would appear to be central.\n\nAccording to reports, the cases against Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China, were dropped after Powell said China would not be described as an enemy in any trial – considered necessary for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.\n\nCash and Berry deny accusations that they provided information about Westminster to China’s politburo.\n\nUnder the updated national security strategy released in June, China was listed as a “geostrategic challenge” rather than an enemy.\n\nAppearing on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, Phillipson was asked why the case had lapsed. She said: “Obviously, the Crown Prosecution Service are best placed to explain why they were not able to bring forward a prosecution, but what I can be absolutely clear about is that ministers and others, including the national security adviser, had no role to play in either the substance of the case or the evidence in question.”\n\nSpeaking earlier on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, the education secretary was asked for assurances that Powell took no part in the decision. “Yes, I can give that assurance,” Phillipson replied. “We’re very disappointed that the CPS were not able to take forward the prosecution.”\n\nAsked if the prime minister still had full confidence in Powell, she said he did.\n\nThe centrality of government decision-making emerged last week when Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, wrote to the chairs of two parliamentary select committees to say that the case was dropped after ministers and officials declined to set out that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, despite what he called “many months” of efforts.\n\nThis is key because of case law relating to the Official Secrets Act, which emerged after Cash and Berry were charged. This, connected to the separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, clarified that under the act, a country must be a threat to the UK’s national security at the time of the offence, prompting the need for clarification from the government.\n\nPhillipson told the BBC that because some of the legal changes dated back to 2023, it was a matter for the previous Conservative government. “I’m not making a partisan point when I say this, but there was a different government in office then,” she said.\n\nIn a letter to the prime minister on Sunday evening, Kemi Badenoch urged Starmer to address “key questions which remain unanswered” about the case, claiming the government’s “account of what has happened has changed repeatedly”.\n\nShe added: “This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on members of parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security.”",

      "content": "European stock markets have edged higher and cryptocurrencies rebounded amid signs that a new front in the US-China trade war may not be a severe as first feared.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing escalated again on Friday and over the weekend, as Donald Trump threatened to impose additional US tariffs of 100% on China starting next month.\n\nThe US president accused the country of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals needed for American industry. Beijing said it would retaliate if Trump does not back down.\n\nHowever, Trump and senior US officials opened a door to a possible deal with China on Sunday. The president wrote on Truth Social: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nThe comments have offered some comfort for investors in Europe, with stocks opening mostly higher on Monday. The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose by 0.2% in early trading, while markets in France, Spain, Germany were all up by about 0.5%.\n\nMost big cryptocurrencies rebounded after a deep sell-off over the weekend. Bitcoin edged up by 0.3% to more than $115,000, after falling below $105,000 on Friday. Ether had dropped to less than $3,500 but rebounded to about $4,100.\n\nRichard Hunter, of the broker Interactive Investor, said investors were hoping for a “Taco trade”, which is the idea that markets rally because “Trump Always Chickens Out” (Taco) of aggressive tariff decisions.\n\n“The president’s propensity to shoot from the hip unsettles the investment environment, even though some are already speculating that the Taco trade is alive and well,” he said.\n\nHowever, a heightened sense of uncertainty is pushing investors to gold, which is considered a safe haven asset. Its spot price hit another new high on Monday, rising to as high as $4,078.5 an ounce.\n\nDerren Nathan, of the broker Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that US stock futures suggested that there could be “at least a partial rebound” when the market opens later on Monday.\n\n“Traders may be banking on a similar pattern where American indexes entered a six-month period of almost unbroken growth helped by a string of trade deals, and growing hopes of a soft-landing for the US economy,” he said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped by 2.3%, while the Taiwanese market fell by 1.4% and the Thai exchange declined by 2%. In mainland China, the Shenzhen exchange fell by 1.4% and the Shanghai market slipped 0.4%.\n\nOn Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged the US to promptly correct its “wrong practices” and said it would act to safeguard its interests.\n\nDespite the trade tensions, Chinese exports bounced back in September, topping forecasts as it diversified its markets.\n\nChinese exports rose by 8.3% year on year last month, according to official customs data. This was the fastest growth since March, and beat a 6% increase forecast by economists polled by Reuters. It comes after a 4.4% increase in August.",

      "content": "Beijing has told the US it will retaliate if Donald Trump fails to back down on his threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports as investors brace for another bout of trade war turmoil.\n\nChina’s commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose the additional tariffs on China’s exports to the US, along with new controls on critical software, by 1 November.\n\n“Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it.\n\n“If the United States insists on going the wrong way, China will surely take resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests.”\n\nTrump and senior US administration officials opened a door to a China trade deal on Sunday as market futures showed another US stock market drop.\n\n“Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe message came after JD Vance called on Beijing to “choose the path of reason” in the latest spiralling trade fight between the world’s two leading economies that has shaken stock markets.\n\nDow futures showed a drop of 887 points ahead of the stock markets’ open on Monday. The index dropped sharply lower on Friday after reignited fears of a trade war with China when threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after China said it would restrict rare earth exports. The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%.\n\n“It’s going to be a delicate dance, and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond,” Vance said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures. “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China. If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable,” he said, then the US would, too.\n\nThe US president shocked the financial markets on Friday when he accused China of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth materials needed by US industry.\n\nIt prompted heavy falls on Wall Street, where about $2tn (£1.5tn) was wiped off the value of the US stocks.\n\nChina insisted on Sunday that its latest export controls on rare earths such as holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium were legitimate.\n\n“China’s export controls are not export bans,” said the commerce ministry spokesperson. “All applications of compliant export for civil use can get approval, so that relevant businesses have no need to worry.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The futures market indicates there could be further losses in London and New York on Monday, although there could also be relief that Beijing has not yet retaliated.\n\nBitcoin, which had tumbled 8% after Trump’s post on Truth Social, rose by 4% on Sunday after China refrained from retaliating.\n\nTrump’s tariff threat was “a rather unwelcome development for financial markets” as investors had “by and large moved on from the trade and tariff story”, said Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at the brokerage firm Pepperstone.\n\n“Chiefly, the question that every man and his dog are attempting to answer is whether this is a credible threat, that the Trump admin might follow through on, or whether this is another example of the ‘escalate to de-escalate’ strategy that Trump used so frequently earlier in the year.\n\n“A strategy where outlandish and ridiculous tariff figures are threatened, in an attempt to focus minds, extract concessions from the other party, and ultimately come to agreement faster than otherwise might’ve been possible.”",

      "content": "The Albanese government has dramatically rewritten its major tax policy, caving in to criticism on its controversial superannuation tax plan by raising thresholds and slashing the amount of money it will rake in.\n\nAfter a long period of sustained attack from politicians and lobby groups, the government has conceded defeat on all major criticisms, with the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, saying the policy rewrites would “better target superannuation concessions”.\n\nChalmers also unveiled a new sweetener, a new tax offset for low-income earners to boost their super earnings.\n\nLabor scraps key elements of controversial superannuation tax plan as Greens call move ‘gift to the super-rich’\n\nWhat are the superannuation changes? In the original plan outlined in February 2023, the Labor government proposed to add another 15% in tax to superannuation balances over $3m, taking that total concessional tax rate to 30%. The balance was not intended to be indexed, a major criticism from opponents. Under the changes outlined by Chalmers on Monday, the government will index the balance to the CPI measure of inflation. It will also add a new threshold, taxing balances of between $3m and $10m at 30%, and balances over $10m at 40%. The changes will also be delayed by a year from their intended start date, now coming into force in July 2026.\n\nAre unrealised gains still being taxed? Another major criticism was that the original proposal would have calculated tax on unrealised gains – that is, earnings made “on paper” inside an account, but which had not yet been cashed out. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Critics were concerned that assets held inside super accounts, including homes or farms not intended to be sold for some time, could increase in value and leave their owners liable for a tax bill; the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, called this “theoretical profits”. Treasury said the “revised methodology” will now apply to realised earnings, based on taxable income. “These are sensible changes which take more than two years of feedback into account,” Chalmers said. “We have worked through the issues and we found another way to deliver on the same objectives.”\n\nDo lower income Australians benefit from the new low income superannuation tax offset rules? While the focus was on the upper end, Chalmers also announced an unexpected change to super rules for the lowest earners. From 2027, the low income superannuation tax offset (Listo) will be increased from $500 to $810, and its eligibility threshold raised from $37,000 to $45,000. This increased offset could mean an extra $15,000 in the super balances of lower paid earners by the end of their working lives. Chalmers said the change would “help deliver a more secure retirement for 1.3 million Australians, of which around 60% are women”. Up to 3.1 million Australians will now be eligible for the Listo.\n\nAre more people affected by this new super plan, and by how much? The government says the changes at the top end of balances will still affect around the same number of people, about 0.5% of taxpayers. The original proposal was expected to raise $2.7bn in its first full year. The revised plan will instead raise $1.6bn in its first year. Chalmers said the net impact on the budget over the next four years would be about $4.2bn, with a major part due to its one-year delay.\n\nIs there bipartisan support for the new superannuation plan? The original plan did not muster enough support to pass in the previous parliament. Both the Coalition and Greens have held their cards close to their chest about this plan, waiting for more details. However, O’Brien did call the government’s backdown “a victory for the Coalition of commonsense”, and the changes “a full knock-down rebuild of an utterly failed policy.” The Greens were open to the Listo changes and the indexation, but wanted to see the threshold amounts lowered – not lifted.\n\nWhy are these superannuation changes being announced now? Labor had unveiled the super tax plan in February 2023, and stood by it for two-and-a-half years despite mounting criticism. As late as Friday, Anthony Albanese had downplayed the prospect of imminent changes to the policy; but Chalmers said the changes had been approved by the Albanese cabinet’s expenditure review committee on Friday. Albanese is out of the country on a week of leave. He will return to work on Sunday, immediately flying to Washington DC to meet the US president, Donald Trump. Asked why now, Chalmers said the government had “taken our time to work through the issues”. “We didn’t react quickly to every editorial or every criticism from every quarter,” he said. “When it comes to the feedback that we’ve had for more than two years now, the objective there has been to separate the genuine feedback from the usual kind of predictable, partisan feedback that you get from time to time.”",

      "content": "The Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded for work on technology’s impact on sustained economic growth.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on Monday that the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2025 would be shared among American-Israeli Joel Mokyr, France’s Philippe Aghion and Canada’s Peter Howitt “for having explained innovation-driven economic growth”.\n\nThe award was based on the idea that vast numbers of people have been lifted out of poverty over the past two centuries as the world has seen sustained economic growth with technology the underlying cause. Previously, stagnation was the norm throughout most of human history, the jury said in a statement.\n\nMokyr, a professor at Northwestern University in the United States, won half of the prize for using historical records to identify what changed during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nHis research showed lasting growth depends on grasping why technologies function, not merely observing that they do. Before that understanding developed during the Industrial Revolution, it was difficult to build upon new discoveries and inventions.\n\nAghion, from College de France and The London School of Economics, and Howitt, from Brown University in the US, share the other half of the prize “for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction,” the jury said.\n\nIn an article published in 1992, they developed a mathematical framework for “creative destruction,” a concept popularised by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in the early 1900s, describing how new products replace old ones in the marketplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe award has a total cash prize of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m), which Mokyr will split with Aghion and Howitt.\n\nThe economics prize wraps up this year’s Nobel season, which honoured research into the human immune system, practical applications of quantum mechanics and the development of new forms of molecular architecture.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was awarded the highly watched Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nShe surprised many when she dedicated it to US President Donald Trump, who had made no secret of the fact that he thought he deserved it.\n\nThe economics prize is the only Nobel not among the original five created in the will of Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896.\n\nIt was instead created through a donation from the Swedish central bank in 1968, leading detractors to dub it “a false Nobel”.",

      "content": "The whereabouts of President Andry Rajoelina is unknown following the move over the weekend by an elite military unit to offer support to Gen Z protests.\n\nClick here to share on social media\n\nMadagascar’s embattled President Andry Rajoelina has announced he will address the nation amid pressure from protesters and from within the military for him to resign.\n\nThe presidency announced on Monday that Rajoelina would deliver a televised address at 7pm local time (16:00 GMT). Meanwhile, with persistent rumours that he has lost control of the country, protesters have called for new rallies in the capital, Antananarivo.\n\nStudent-led demonstrations across recent weeks have met with aggression from authorities. However, the president was forced to take a backward step over the weekend as an elite military unit came out in support of the protesters’ demand that he quit.\n\nSoldiers from the CAPSAT unit openly sided with the protesters on Saturday.\n\nThe following day, Rajoelina declared that a coup was taking place, as CAPSAT installed a new military chief during a ceremony attended by the armed forces minister, who welcomed the appointment.\n\nHome or abroad?\n\nThe president’s whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nAuthorities have asserted that he is in Madagascar and managing national affairs. However, hundreds returned to the streets on Monday in a celebratory mood amid rumours that Rajoelina has fled.\n\nSome soldiers joined the crowd, with students hanging from military vehicles and brandishing flags.\n\nThe student group leading the protest movement, which has called itself Gen Z, has called for another demonstration on Monday.\n\nThe military intervention marks a dramatic escalation in unrest that erupted on September 25 over chronic electricity and water shortages, before evolving into wider calls for political change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We responded to the people’s call,” a commander of the CAPSAT unit, Colonel Michael Randrianirina, told reporters.\n\nThe defection carries particular significance given CAPSAT’s pivotal role in the 2009 military-backed coup that brought Rajoelina to power.\n\nThe military has repeatedly intervened in politics since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960.\n\nOn Sunday, crowds gathered at the symbolic May 13 Square – the traditional heart of political uprisings in Antananarivo – to celebrate alongside CAPSAT soldiers, who drove through in armoured vehicles to cheers from protesters waving national flags.\n\nRFI, France’s public broadcaster, reported that among those present was former President Marc Ravalomanana, whom Rajoelina ousted.\n\nPositioning himself as a reformist, Rajoelina led a transitional government until 2014, stepping aside to restore constitutional order. He returned after winning the 2019 election and secured a second full term in 2023.\n\nThe United Nations says at least 22 people have been killed and more than 100 injured since demonstrations began, although the government disputes these figures. One CAPSAT soldier died in clashes with the gendarmerie on Saturday.\n\nThe protests have exposed deep frustration in one of the world’s poorest nations, where only a third of the population has access to electricity and blackouts routinely exceed eight hours a day.\n\nThe Gen Z Madagascar movement, at the heart of the protests, has drawn inspiration from uprisings that have challenged governments in several countries, including Kenya, Indonesia and Peru, recently.\n\nSuch youth-led demonstrations have helped to unseat governments in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\nGen Z Madagascar has refused government offers for dialogue, despite repeated outreach efforts by Rajoelina’s administration.",

      "content": "Palestinian families awaiting return of imprisoned relatives are shocked to learn they will be deported.\n\nFamilies of many of the Palestinian prisoners being released by Israel under an exchange deal say their long-awaited freedom is bittersweet after they learned their loved ones would be deported to third countries.\n\nAt least 154 Palestinian prisoners being freed on Monday as part of the swap for Israeli captives held in Gaza will be forced into exile by Israel, the Palestinian Prisoners’ Media Office said.\n\nThose to be deported are among a larger group of Palestinians being released by Israel – 250 people held in Israeli prisons along with about 1,700 Palestinians seized from the Gaza Strip during two years of Israel’s war, many of whom were “forcibly disappeared”, according to the United Nations. For its part, Hamas and other Palestinian groups released 20 Israeli captives under a Gaza ceasefire agreement.\n\nThere are no details yet about where the freed Palestinians will be sent, but in a previous prisoner release in January, dozens of detainees were deported to countries in the region, including Tunisia, Algeria and Turkiye.\n\nObservers said the forced exile illegally breaches the citizenship rights of the released prisoners and is a demonstration of the double standards surrounding the exchange deals.\n\n“It goes without saying it’s illegal,” Tamer Qarmout, associate professor in public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It is illegal because these are citizens of Palestine. They have no other citizenships. They’re out of a small prison, but they’re sent to a bigger prison, away from their society, to new countries in which they will face major restrictions. It’s inhumane.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamilies shocked by deportations\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, relatives of Palestinian prisoner Muhammad Imran said they were shocked to learn he was among those Israel had decided to force into exile.\n\nRaed Imran said the family had previously received a call from an Israeli intelligence officer, confirming that his brother, 43, would be released home and asking where he would stay on his release.\n\nBut on Monday, the family was dismayed to learn that Muhammad, who was arrested in December 2022 and sentenced to 13 life terms, would be deported.\n\n“Today’s news was a shock, but we are still waiting. Maybe we’ll get to see him somehow,” Imran said. “What matters is that he is released, here or abroad.”\n\nThe exile means his family might be unable to travel overseas to meet him due to Israel’s control of the borders.\n\n“We might be looking at families who will be seeing their loved ones deported and exiled out of Palestine but have no way of seeing them,” said Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim, who has reported extensively from the occupied West Bank.\n\n‘A win-win for Israel’\n\nAccording to Qarmout, the deportations are intended to deprive Hamas and other Palestinian groups of being able to claim any symbolic win from the exchange and to remove the deported prisoners from any involvement in political or other activities.\n\n“Exile means the end of their political future,” he said. “In the countries they go to, they will face extreme constraints, so they will not be able to be active in any front related to the conflict.”\n\nHe said the deportations amounted to forcible displacement of the released prisoners and collective punishment for their families, who would either be separated from their exiled loved ones or forced to leave their homeland if they were permitted by Israel to travel to join them.\n\n“It’s a win-win for Israel,” he said, contrasting their experiences to those of the released Israeli captives, who will be able to resume their lives in Israel.\n\n“It’s more double standards and hypocrisy,” he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mosab Shawer in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank",

      "content": "Celebrations in Israel as living captives held by Hamas freed. Israel’s release of about 2,000 Palestinians under way.\n\nHamas has released all 20 of the living captives it had been holding in the Gaza Strip, with the release of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners by Israel under way, as the two sides carry out the conditions of the ceasefire deal.\n\nCheers broke out in Israel early on Monday, as television channels announced that the first lot of seven captives had been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n\nThe Israeli military later confirmed that 13 more captives taken from Israel on October 7, 2023, who had been held in Gaza for more than two years, were also transferred.\n\nMeanwhile, preparations for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails were progressing, with buses seen outside the Ofer military prison, in the occupied West Bank, where many of the Palestinian prisoners due to be released were held.\n\nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the prisoners would be released once Israel received confirmation that all the living captives were on Israeli territory.\n\nIsrael’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a post on X, identified the captives released in the first group as Guy Gilboa Dalal, 24, Eitan Mor, 25, Matan Angrest, 22, Alon Ohel, 24, Gali and Ziv Berman, both 28, and Omri Miran, 48.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamilies were reunited with their loved ones before the released captives were flown to hospitals for medical treatment.\n\nReporting from Amman, Jordan, Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh said the released captives were “reported to be in reasonable condition, walking without needing medical assistance”.\n\nOhel’s parents told The Times of Israel that their son “looks amazing” and is “standing on his own two feet”, while Mor’s mother told Ynet News that her son “looks great, although thin and pale”.\n\nEarlier, Netanyahu’s spokesperson had said Israel expected that all living captives would be released before the 09:00 GMT deadline, under the terms of the ceasefire agreement proposed by United States President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, Israel does not expect the repatriation of the bodies of the remaining 28 captives to be completed on Monday, despite a 72-hour deadline agreed under the deal, the spokesperson said.\n\n‘The war is over’\n\nWhile key questions remain over the future of Gaza and Hamas’s role in the territory, the exchange of captives and prisoners has raised hopes for ending the devastating war, which has ravaged the enclave, with at least 67,806 people killed and 170,066 wounded in the Palestinian enclave.\n\nThe ceasefire is also expected to allow for a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza, where famine has broken out amid Israel’s bombardment and blockade of the territory. Many of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are reported to be on the brink of starvation.\n\nAmid the transfers, Trump, whose administration played a leading role in putting together the deal, arrived at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport, where he was welcomed by Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Netanyahu.\n\nTrump is set to address the Israeli Knesset later on Monday, after which he will fly to Egypt to co-chair a summit on the ceasefire agreement.\n\n“The war is over,” Trump told reporters as he left for Israel on Sunday, adding he thought the ceasefire would hold.\n\nReporting from Khan Younis, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said a designated medical point had been set up at the Nasser Medical Complex to offer medical checks to the returning Palestinian prisoners before they are reunited with their families.\n\nThousands of Palestinians had gathered outside the hospital waiting to welcome the released detainees, she said.\n\nWaiting in Khan Younis was Yasser Abu Azzoum, whose 23-year-old son Mohammed was set to be released under the deal.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera the feeling was “indescribable”.\n\n“I’m not able to speak properly because I am overwhelmed with joy,” Abu Azzoum said.",

      "description": "A decades-long fight ramps up in Grassy Narrows as mercury poisoning threatens its water, people and way of life.",
      "content": "Grassy Narrows First Nation – William “Bill” Fobister remembers when things changed, seemingly overnight.\n\nThe 79-year-old had grown up fishing across the sprawling English-Wabigoon River system.\n\nAnd the deep blue waters that lap the shores of his Ojibwe community - Asubpeeschoseewagong Netum Anishinabek, better known as Grassy Narrows - had fed his people since time immemorial.\n\n“[My dad] was a commercial fisherman, and I helped him. That’s how we survived,” Bill recalls, sitting at a yellow picnic table in his backyard on a rainy August morning.\n\nThen, he says, in 1970, “everything shut down.”\n\nThat’s when authorities confirmed that a pulp and paper mill in Dryden, upstream from Grassy Narrows, had dumped more than 9,000kg (20,000lb) of mercury into the river in northwestern Ontario, Canada, starting in the early 1960s.\n\nBill, then in his 20s, remembers the first signs that something was wrong.\n\n“We noticed the fish were floating in the bays, and then we reported it,” says the soft-spoken Indigenous community elder. “They tested the fish. Sure enough, they found mercury in the fish.”\n\nHis family and neighbours soon began to fall sick. The commercial fishing that so many in Grassy Narrows relied on was shut down. And a way of life that goes back thousands of years was unmistakably shaken.\n\nIt was one of the worst environmental and health disasters in Canadian history.\n\n“They devastated [the community] without having any concern about what they’re doing to us,” says Bill, who wears a purple hoodie and blue baseball cap emblazoned with a multicoloured fish.\n\nBill has been diagnosed with mercury poisoning. His late father and some of his uncles also had it, he says. Now, so too do his wife and several of his children and grandchildren.\n\nThey are among the 90 percent of people in Grassy Narrows believed to be suffering from mercury poisoning today.\n\n“Almost everyone in the community has something: diabetes, cancers and heart attacks, kidney failure and the liver [problems],” he says, running through the long list of symptoms.\n\n“It’s still ongoing today, and a lot of kids have been damaged.”\n\nThat continued harm has pushed multiple generations of people in Grassy Narrows to raise their voices to demand justice and accountability as the river system remains polluted - and, according to a recent study, is getting worse.\n\nTheir decades-long battle is now culminating in a landmark lawsuit that could have far-reaching impacts for the environmental rights of Indigenous communities across Canada, with the outcome potentially setting a precedent for how First Nations can defend their territories from industrial threats.\n\nBill and his neighbours want compensation for past and continued damage to their health and way of life - and for the mill that poisoned them to be shut down, once and for all.\n\n\"I don’t think they totally, fully understand what’s happening to them,\" he says of affected community members.\n\n\"But they notice that they’re sick, they feel different. Even looking at their kids, some of them are almost deformed. That’s the scary part.

      "content": "Citi is seen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 3, 2025.\n\nCiti is aiming to launch a service for the custody of crypto assets in 2026, an executive at the bank told CNBC, as Wall Street giants expand their footprint in the digital currency space.\n\nBiswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships and innovation in the services business at Citi said the bank has been developing a crypto custody service for the last two-to-three years and is making progress.\n\n\"We have various kinds of explorations ... and we're hoping that in the next few quarters, we can come to market with a credible custody solution that we can offer to our asset managers and other clients,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nFor a long time, traditional financial instutions have stayed away from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether . However, President Donald Trump's administration has built a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets in the U.S. as new laws such as the GENIUS Act has looked to regulate specific areas including stablecoins. This has enabled traditional financial institutions to launch products and services to do with digital assets.\n\nIn the world of crypto, custody comes in many forms including a digital asset exchange holding digital coins or the institution itself doing self-custody. Custodian services enable a bank to hold assets on behalf of its clients. This could for example, include shares in companies. There are also companies that have sprung up specifically related to crypto custody.\n\nChatterjee said the upcoming custody service would involve Citi holding the native cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are risks with all forms of custody such as cyberattacks that lead to theft of assets. Banks may offer an alternative because they are heavily regualted and have a history in the custody of assets.\n\nFor Citi, Chatterjee said the lender is looking at both an in-house developed technology solution for custody as well as potential partnerships with third-parties.\n\n\"We may have certain solutions that are completely designed and built in-house that are targeted towards certain assets and certain segment of our clients, whereas may we may use a ... third party, lightweight, nimble solution for other kind of assets,\" Chatterjee told CNBC.\n\n\"So we're not currently ruling out anything.\"\n\nNot all Wall Street banks are convinced on the custody strategy. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this year that while the bank will let clients buy cryptocurrencies, it will not custody the asset.",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared the war in the Middle East is over, as he embarked on a trip to the region to finalize a peace deal for Gaza. Trump arrived in Tel Aviv earlier Monday to mark the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas after more than two years in captivity. Arriving at the Israeli parliament where he was set to address lawmakers, Trump told reporters that Hamas will disarm, according to comments reported by Reuters. When asked whether the war was over, he told reporters \"yes.\" Greeted with a trumpet fanfare, standing ovation and cheers in the Knesset, Trump delivered a speech in which he said that the \"long and painful nightmare\" was finally over for both the Israelis and Palestinians. Trump said America joined its ally in two \"everlasting vows\": \"Never forget, and never again.\" Signaling a conciliatory mood, the president said the ceasefire was \"a very exciting time for Israel and the Middle East\" and noted Israel had won all it could \"by force of arms.\" It was time, he insisted, to turn those efforts into peace and prosperity.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe president called for a peace deal with Iran and said the hand of friendship and cooperation was always open, \"even to Iran, whose regime has inflicted so much death on the Middle East.\" \"I'm telling you, they want to make a deal,\" Trump said, adding: \"We are ready when you are.\" Iran is the main foreign backer of Hamas, whose attack on Israel on Oct. 7 2023 saw 1,200 people killed and hundreds taken hostage. Israel's response and the ensuing war has left more than 67,000 Palestinians dead, including thousands of civilians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Gaza itself has been largely destroyed with most buildings in ruins. \"You've won and now you can build and you can do something you never even thought possible,\" Trump said, encouraging Israel to focus on and commit to long-lasting peace efforts.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump addresses the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on October 13, 2025 in Jerusalem. Pool | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nHe also repeatedly returned to the theme of rebuilding and reconstruction, telling the Knesset that the \"total focus of Gazans must be on restoring the fundamentals of stability, safety, dignity and economic development.\" Trump said the U.S. intended to help them in this cause. The U.S. president praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military chiefs, as well as Arab countries who have helped to broker a ceasefire. He also praised the efforts of his senior officials and advisors, including Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Pete Hegseth. Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released in total on Monday, as well as 28 additional captives — including 26 confirmed dead and two whose status remains uncertain. In exchange for the hostages, Israel is due to release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Trump will address the Israeli parliament after meeting with hostage families. He is then due to travel to Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt for a major international summit with around 20 other world leaders to finalize an agreement to end the war in Gaza.",

      "description": "OpenAI is teaming up with Broadcom to jointly develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators starting in 2026.",
      "content": "In this article AVGO Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nSam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nWeeks after Broadcom 's stock shot up on the disclosure of a $10 billion customer that analysts said was OpenAI, the two companies have made the partnership official. OpenAI and Broadcom said Monday that they're jointly building and deploying 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators as part of a broader effort across the industry to scale AI infrastructure. Broadcom shares climbed 9% following news of the deal. The companies didn't disclose financial terms. While the companies have been working together for 18 months, they're now going public with plans to develop and deploy racks of OpenAI-designed chips starting late next year. OpenAI has announced massive deals in recent weeks with Nvidia , Oracle and Advanced Micro Devices , as it tries to secure the capital and compute needs necessary for its historically ambitious AI buildout plans. \"These things have gotten so complex you need the whole thing,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a podcast with OpenAI and Broadcom executives that the companies released along with the news. The systems include networking, memory and compute — all customized for OpenAI's workloads and built on Broadcom's Ethernet stack. By designing its own chips, OpenAI can bring compute costs down and stretch its infrastructure dollars further. Industry estimates peg the cost of a 1-gigawatt data center at roughly $50 billion, with $35 billion of that typically allocated to chips — based on Nvidia's current pricing.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Broadcom deal provides \"a gigantic amount of computing infrastructure to serve the needs of the world to use advanced intelligence,\" Altman said. \"We can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models — all of that.\" Broadcom has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, as hyperscalers have been snapping up its custom AI chips, which the company calls XPUs. Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, but analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google , Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance. Shares of Broadcom are up 40% this year after more than doubling in 2024, and the company's market cap has surpassed $1.5 trillion. OpenAI President Greg Brockman said the company used its own models to accelerate chip design and improve efficiency. \"We've been able to get massive area reductions,\" he said in the podcast. \"You take components that humans have already optimized and just pour compute into it, and the model comes out with its own optimizations.\" Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in the same conversation that OpenAI is the company building \"the most-advanced\" frontier models. \"You continue to need compute capacity — the best, latest compute capacity — as you progress in a road map towards a better and better frontier model and towards superintelligence,\" he said. \"If you do your own chips, you control your destiny.\"\n\nHock Tan, CEO of Broadcom. Martin H. Simon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAltman indicated that 10 gigawatts is just the beginning. \"Even though it's vastly more than the world has today, we expect that very high-quality intelligence delivered very fast and at a very low price — the world will absorb it super fast and just find incredible new things to use it for,\" he said. OpenAI today operates on just over 2 gigawatts of compute capacity. Altman said that's been enough to scale ChatGPT to where it is today, as well as develop and launch video creation service Sora and do a lot of AI research. But demand is soaring. OpenAI has announced roughly 33 gigawatts of compute commitments over the past three weeks across partnerships with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom. \"If we had 30 gigawatts today with today's quality of models,\" he added, \"I think you would still saturate that relatively quickly in terms of what people would do.\" WATCH: China opens antitrust probe into Qualcomm's Autotalks deals",

Here's how he and other analysts say both sides are seeing things differently.\n\nBeijing may feel it needs to respond to a new U.S. rule released on Sept. 29 which expands the scope of export controls to majority owned subsidiaries of companies on a U.S. list — while Washington likely saw the change as a technical adjustment.\n\nOn the flip side, Beijing may see its rare earths restrictions as mimicking Washington's wide-reaching effort to restrict China's access to high-end tech, while the U.S. perception is that the restrictions are a negotiation strategy that aims to create leverage before a potential meeting between the two countries' presidents.",

      "description": "The agreement between Bloom Energy and Brookfield Asset Management is the latest deal to develop power solutions for data center campuses.",
      "content": "Shares of Bloom Energy soared early Monday after striking a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nBrookfield will spend up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom Energy's technology, the first investment in its strategy to support big AI data centers with power and computing infrastructure. Bloom's fuel cells are \"fuel-flexible\" and can run on natural gas, biogas or hydrogen, the company says.\n\nBrookfield and Bloom are collaborating to design and build what they are calling \"AI factories\" around the the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year.\n\nShares of Bloom Energy jumped more than 20%. Bloom's fuel cells provide onsite power that can be quickly installed because they don't rely on a connection to the electric grid.\n\nBloom has already positioned hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities including American Electric Power and data centers developers such as Equinix and Oracle , according to the company.\n\nThe AI industry's data center plans are growing in scale. Nvidia and OpenAI, for example, recently announced a partnership that aims to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, equivalent to the power consumed by New York City at the height of summer.\n\nBut AI companies' plans are butting up against an aging U.S. electric grid that is often slow to provide additional power capacity. Data centers also threaten to raise electricity prices for residential customers.\n\nDeploying power solutions \"behind-the-meter,\" or off the grid, \"are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories,\" said Brookfield's global head of AI infrastructure Sikander Rashid.\n\n\"AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale,\" Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar said.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week that the AI industry will need to build power off the electric grid to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.\n\n\"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" Huang said.",

      "content": "The Middle East has traditionally not ranked among the top destinations for Chinese travelers, but that appears to be changing fast.\n\nDuring this year's extended Golden Week holiday — which runs Oct. 1–8 — Chinese travel reservations to Doha surged 441% from a year earlier, while bookings to Abu Dhabi rose 229%, according to Trip.com. The online travel agency said its data covered Sept. 27 to Oct. 8, as many office workers took additional leave to lengthen the break.\n\nMeanwhile, Dubai saw a 27% increase, placing it among the top 10 destinations outside Asia, according to travel data analytics firm ForwardKeys, which counted international departures from China between Sept. 27 and Oct. 12.\n\nThe Emirate, which is part of the United Arab Emirates, was also one of the top choices for affluent Chinese travelers traveling on premium economy, business, and first class seats, with demand going up 133% year on year.\n\nThat rise reflects a broader trend of more Chinese travelers heading to the Middle East. Flights from China to the region have grown by 25% so far this year from the same period in 2024, Edmund Ong, general manager at Trip.com Singapore, told CNBC.\n\nThe growth is even more striking when compared to the same period in 2019, Ong said, with current levels over 180% higher than before the pandemic.\n\nThe five fastest-growing overseas destinations for hotel bookings during the Golden Week were Saudi Arabia, Egypt, New Zealand, Kazakhstan, and the UAE, according to a Google translation of data from Tongcheng Travel, the second-largest online travel booking platform in China.\n\nWithin the Middle East, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, and Oman were the most popular, Ong said.\n\nStill, the usual suspects — nearby, affordable and visa-free Asian countries — continued to dominate outbound travel for Chinese tourists, led by Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, and Singapore, data from Trip.com showed.\n\nAccessibility, 'uniqueness' fuel demand\n\nThe Middle East's growing popularity in recent years has been driven by relaxed visa policies and more direct flight routes, Ong said.\n\n\"Pre-Covid, particularly the UAE — Dubai and Abu Dhabi — were very popular because they had very easy visa processing. And visas and the accessibility of visa or no visa is a real big driver for Chinese citizens,\" said Alexander Glos, CEO of China i2i Group, a Shanghai-based marketing and business development company.\n\nIn the immediate years, post-Covid, the UAE and some countries in the Middle East \"did very well,\" Glos added. \"Again, that was because it was open, it was a place to go, it was easy to go to, it was affordable, and offered a lot of different travel opportunities.\"\n\nThe Middle East has also been \"very progressive\" in adding direct flights into Chinese cities, said Peggy Li, CEO and managing director of Chinese marketing consultancy SPS Affinity. She noted that the flag carrier of Dubai, Emirates, in July inaugurated a new flight route to Hangzhou, which houses the headquarters of Alibaba and is near Hong Kong — just weeks after beginning flights to Shenzhen.\n\n\"If you look at these new destinations of where Emirates have started… it is not only for touristic perspective, [but also] is commercially strategic,\" Li said.",

Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,\" it said, identifying the automotive industry as particularly vulnerable.\n\nGovernance changes\n\nIn a corporate filing dated Oct.13, lodged with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Wingtech confirmed Nexperia was under temporary external management and had been asked to suspend changes to the company's assets, business or personnel for up to a year, according to a Google translation.\n\nWingtech Chairman Zhang Xuezheng had been immediately suspended from his roles as executive director of Nexperia Holdings and nonexecutive director of Nexperia after the ministerial order, according to the filing.\n\nThe filing added that Nexperia's daily operations will continue, with the impact of the measures not yet quantifiable.\n\n\"The Dutch government's decision to freeze Nexperia's global operations under the pretext of 'national security' constitutes excessive intervention driven by geopolitical bias, rather than a fact-based risk assessment,\" Wingtech said in a deleted WeChat post, which was archived and translated by Chinese policy blog Pekingnology.\n\nIt added that since it acquired Nexperia in 2019, Wingtech \"has strictly abided by the laws and regulations of all jurisdictions where it operates, maintaining transparent operations and sound governance,\" and employs \"thousands of local staff\" through research and development and manufacturing sites in the Netherlands, Germany and Britain.\n\nA spokesperson from Nexperia told CNBC that the company had no further comments, but that it \"complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,\" and remained in regular contact with relevant authorities.\n\nThe Netherlands' move comes after Beijing tightened its restrictions on the export of rare earth elements and magnets Thursday, which could impact Europe's automotive industry.\n\nThe move could also further strain trade relations between China and the Netherlands, following years of restrictions on Dutch company ASML's exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.\n\nIn 2023, the Netherlands had also investigated Nexperia's proposed acquisition of chip firm startup Nowi, though the deal was later approved.",

Personnel at the scene eventually used a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze, local reports said.\n\nChengdu police said the crash occurred after the SU7 collided with another sedan, killing a 31-year-old male driver who was suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.",

      "content": "The Chinese national flag fluttering with the Lujiazui Financial District in the background. Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nChina's stock market rebound may be showing signs of strain as renewed U.S.-China trade tensions threaten to derail investor optimism. After months of relative calm, Washington's fresh warnings over Beijing's rare earth export controls and renewed trade tensions have revived fears of another tit-for-tat trade cycle. Chinese shares had recently rallied to a multi-year high on expectations of government stimulus and a recent inflow of foreign capital into Chinese equities. Mainland China's benchmark CSI 300, which tracks major stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rallied almost 20% since the start of the year to Oct. 9, while the Hang Seng Index surged around 33% in the same period. However, the possibility of that rally continuing was predicated on stability in geopolitical risk, especially on trade. With tariff rhetoric back at the forefront, analysts warned sentiment could quickly unravel. Both indexes lost over 2% on Monday.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nMarkets had priced in détente ahead of a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. But those expectations have faded. \"I think it's not very likely,\" said Sean Darby, chief global strategist at Mizuho Securities, when asked if such a summit would materialize now. \"Perhaps the United States has been taken by surprise by how strong the backlash has been from China… we're going to have a much more difficult couple of weeks now, because markets had expected some sort of truce.\"\n\nIf neither side were to blink, the U.S. and Chinese economies would lead the global economy into a deep recession, if not a depression. Ed Yardeni President of Yardeni Research\n\nDarby added that global equities were \"perfectly priced\" and ill-prepared for a renewed trade confrontation. \"Positioning has been very aggressive, both in equities and in credit… everything that could be perfectly set for markets to do well.\" The MSCI World index, which tracks over a thousand large and mid-cap companies from 23 developed markets, rose almost 17% since the start of the year before Trump on Friday said the United States would impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China. The surprise re-emergence of tariff conflict risks grinding equities sideways, if not worse. \"Equity markets now are going to trade sideways at best, if not have a further pullback,\" he said.\n\nAn already 'overbought' market?",

      "title": "What is an ‘emerging artist’ anyway?",
      "description": "The art market is turning its taste towards up-and-comers — but will more conservative collectors at Art Basel Paris be persuaded?",
      "content": "The term “emerging artist” likely conjures up an image of a struggling twenty-something splattering paint on to an experimental installation that no one would ever buy. Today, while experimentation is still welcomed, the art world’s definition of what constitutes an emerging artist has broadened to encompass practitioners outside of the mainstream, of any age — and the desire is definitely to sell.\n\nThe shift is evident at this year’s Art Basel Paris, where 15 artists comprise its “Emergence” section, and are by no means all straight out of art school. The oldest on show is Xiyadie, a self-taught, Chinese papercut artist in his early sixties, who explores homoerotic themes through delicate works. His gallerist, Mimi Chun of Blindspot Gallery, says “I’m quite impressed by the fair organisers. I think [including Xiyadie] is a statement about supporting and being open-minded to artists from a diversity of practices and backgrounds.”\n\nChinese papercut artist Xiyadie is being shown by Blindspot Gallery © Courtesy the artist\n\nXiyadie has had international recognition, including recent showings at the Venice Biennale and The Drawing Center in New York. But, Chun says, “until he was in his forties, he identified as a migrant, blue-collar farmer, not as an artist”, noting that he didn’t have a commercial gallery until 2018. Much of this stems from being a gay man in rural China, where he grew up before moving to Beijing — his name is a pseudonym, meaning Siberian Butterfly, which he used to protect his identity in the city’s subcultural scene, Chun says. The works she brings to Paris “tell the story of coming out, part biography and part fantasy” and comprise unseen, historical papercuts from the 1980s and ’90s, as well as four new and larger pieces, in bucolic settings, revealing a later-life “utopian vision of people coexisting in harmony with nature,” Chun says.\n\n‘Ricochet: CBTT II’ (2025) by Kandis Williams © Stefan Korte, courtesy of the artist and Heidi, Berlin ‘Ricochet: CBTT I’ (2025) by Kandis Williams © Stefan Korte, courtesy of the artist and Heidi, Berlin\n\nPauline Seguin, founder of Berlin’s Heidi gallery, brings a film, collages and lenticular prints (which shift according to viewpoints) by the research-based American artist Kandis Williams (born 1985). Seguin describes the works, which explore racial dynamics in the context of US militarisation, as “visually strong, and will also challenge fairgoers”. She finds that the word “emerging” gives artists some license to grow and experiment “with a freedom that established artists don’t have any more”.\n\nClément Delépine, the outgoing director of Art Basel Paris, says the same is true of the galleries in this section. “If you look at the exhibitors for an [emerging] art fair like Liste in the 1990s you had participants such as [the now well-known] David Zwirner, Galerie Eva Presenhuber and neugerriemschneider. Some of the galleries you now see in Emergence could become powerhouses in the next 20 years.”\n\nIran-born, Berlin-based artist and filmmaker Arash Nassiri © Chloe-Bonnie More\n\nA theme that runs through many of its artists is that, like Xiyadie and Williams, they have had museum and other institutional recognition but are only just making their mark on the international, commercial scene. London’s Ginny on Frederick gallery is bringing an installation by Iran-born artist Arash Nassiri (b1986) that addresses issues of urban displacement through dolls-house sculptures of empty Tehran shops with flickering neon signs in Farsi. Nassiri has recently shown at the respected KW Institute for Contemporary art in Berlin and has a forthcoming commission for London’s Chisenhale Gallery and the Fondation d’entreprise Pernod Ricard in Paris. His new sculptural installation for the Paris fair is, says gallery founder Freddie Powell, “a work that needs a lot of eyes on it”, something that Art Basel, and the very visible first-floor balcony position of its Emergence section in the Grand Palais, can provide.\n\nOf the “emerging” definition for artists, Powell says “hopefully we can strive for a more inclusive meaning, which is more about the moment for any particular artist, rather than referring to an art-school graduation date”.\n\n‘Farming’ (2025) by Xiyadie, at the Blindspot Gallery booth © Courtesy of the artist and Blindspot Gallery\n\nIt all comes at a time when the wider art market is turning its taste towards lower-priced art, for which “emerging” normally fits the bill. Nearly all of the Emergence galleries interviewed by the Financial Times have booths priced below $60,000. Xiyadie’s work, which starts at $4,000 and tops at $30,000, is “well priced” for the current climate, Chun says.\n\nThe powerhouse galleries are responding to the latest demand and increasingly proposing co-representation arrangements with their smaller peers to secure the latest crop of artists. At Art Basel Paris, Hauser & Wirth’s booth will include their recently shared, earlier career artists, the haunting painter George Rouy and collagist María Berrío.\n\n‘The Plot’ (2025) by María Berrío © María Berrío; courtesy the artist, Hauser & Wirth and Victoria Miro; Photo: Bruce M White\n\nWhen it works, in collaboration rather than competition, their younger gallery counterparts cautiously welcome the dynamic. “It is a reality that is on the up. But it’s good that there are more big galleries contacting me, rather than going directly to the artists,” says Alex Vardaxoglou, who brings a vast new work by Tanoa Sasraku (b1995) to Emergence. Powell finds “you can learn a lot from bigger organisations. It can open doors, but [if not collaborative] it can also close them.”\n\nDetail from ‘Mascot’ (2025) by multimedia artist Tanoa Sasraku, at the Vardaxoglou Gallery’s booth © Photograph: Jack Elliot Edwards; courtesy the artist and Vardaxoglou Gallery, London\n\nWhether or not the traditionally conservative French collector base is equally persuaded by the latest up-and-comers remains to be seen. Seguin says that “France has this beautiful tradition of appreciation for the arts in general, though not so much for the cutting-edge. I will be very interested to see how they will react to [Kandis Williams’s] work.”\n\nDelépine concedes that “Paris was perceived as more dusty, and with longer validation cycles [for new artists] than London or New York.” Now though, he says, his fair’s Emergence section coincides with “an interesting generation of artists coming of age, many of whom were foreigners who have made Paris their home. There is a new dynamism to the city.”\n\nOctober 24-26, artbasel.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow FT Weekend on Instagram, Bluesky and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning",

      "content": "U.S. Vice President JD Vance looks on, on the day U.S. President Donald Trump announces a deal with Pfizer to sell drugs at lower prices, in the Oval office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nVice President JD Vance on Sunday said there is \"a lot of waste and fraud\" in Affordable Care Act tax credits that are at the center of Congress' funding stalemate that has shut down the government.\n\n\"The tax credits go to some people deservedly and we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry,\" Vance said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n\"We want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them,\" he said.\n\nCongressional Democrats are demanding that any legislation to fund the government include an extension for enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans, meanwhile, want to pass a stopgap measure that would resume federal funding at current levels through Nov. 21.\n\nBoth bills failed to pass in the Senate for a seventh time on Thursday, prolonging the federal shutdown that began on Oct. 1.\n\nWith neither party budging on their respective demands, Republicans and Democrats both say the other party is to blame for the shutdown.\n\nAbout 22 million of the 24 million people enrolled in Obamacare health insurance plans sold on government marketplaces received enhanced ACA credits, which lower the cost of that insurance.\n\nThe enhanced credits were introduced during the Covid pandemic in 2021. They raised the amount of financial aid to enrollees. and also made more middle-income enrollees eligible for the subsidies.\n\nThe KFF health policy research group recently said that the average premium paid for an ACA plan would more than double in 2026 if the enhanced tax credits expire.",

      "description": "Lego's MRI scanner play sets, which launched in 2023, are significantly reducing anxiety and the use of sedation in children, according to new research.",
      "content": "In July 2023, just two months after his mother fought and won a battle against breast cancer, Sam Lane began to get sick.\n\nSam underwent several rounds of testing, and the now 14-year-old finally received a diagnosis: a rare brain and spine cancer.\n\n\"They said 'cancer,' and before I started crying, I said, 'Dang it, I was going to guess that, but I didn't want it to be that bad,'\" Sam said.\n\nBut at his lowest point, on a feeding tube and unable to walk, a nurse offered Sam a bright spot: She said she needed his help to build a Lego MRI scanner set for fellow patients at Boston Children's Hospital to play with and learn from.\n\nSam's mom said she was \"blown away\" by the level of detail in the play set, made of specialized Lego bricks.\n\n\"I remember sitting there saying to him, 'Sammy, why don't you take a break? You've been working at that straight for some time,'\" Christina Lane said. \"And he just didn't even look at me and was like, 'Nope, this is important... I need to help other kids.'\"\n\nLego's MRI scanner sets, which feature a scanner, patient bed, waiting room, staff figures and medical instruments, were designed specifically to help children learn about the procedure through hands-on play. The miniature MRI machine table moves back and forth, mimicking a real procedure.\n\nOn Monday, the toy company announced that more than 1 million children globally have used the sets to help them prepare for their medical procedures. New Lego research found that 96% of healthcare professionals said the model helps to reduce children's anxiety, and 46% reported a lesser need to use sedation after the children played with the set.",

      "description": "The tax extension deadline is Oct. 15. Here's what to know about filing your return amid the government shutdown and IRS furloughs.",
      "content": "Valentinrussanov | E+ | Getty Images\n\nDespite the government shutdown, the Oct. 15 federal tax extension deadline is fast approaching for many filers. The process could be harder for some taxpayers after the IRS furloughed nearly half of its workforce —about 34,000 employees — earlier this week, experts say. \"It's going to be a long haul if you need any kind of specialized customer experience,\" said Jennifer MacMillan, president of the National Association of Enrolled Agents, whose members are tax professionals licensed by the IRS.\n\n'Expect increased wait times'\n\nFilers can \"expect increased wait times, backlogs and delays implementing tax law changes as the shutdown continues,\" the National Treasury Employees Union said in a statement Wednesday. \"Taxpayers around the country will now have a much harder time getting the assistance they need, just as they get ready to file their extension returns due next week,\" the organization said.\n\nHowever, some customer service representatives remain at work, according to a 2026 lapsed appropriations contingency plan that went into effect Wednesday. \"During a government shutdown, there could be impacts to IRS services,\" said Elizabeth Young, director for tax practice and ethics with the American Institute of CPAs. \"However, electronic filing systems typically remain operational, so you can still file online.\"\n\nDouble-check your filing\n\nWhile it may be tempting to rush through your tax return to meet the Oct. 15 deadline, errors could cause IRS processing delays, according to Young. The IRS has \"very sophisticated software\" that compares information returns, such as W-2s and 1099s, to what's reported on your filing, she previously told CNBC. Most tax forms arrived in January, February or March. But others may have taken longer, depending on your situation. You can compare your current-year return to last year's filing to avoid missed forms and information, experts say.",

      "description": "Customers of Agentforce Voice can specify the pronunciation of terms and customize the tone of voice for artificial intelligence agents.",
      "content": "Salesforce is adding voice to its Agentforce software, letting clients go beyond text when using artificial intelligence agents to respond to customer questions.\n\nWith Agentforce Voice, companies can customize the tone and speed of voices and adjust the pronunciation of specific terms, Salesforce said Monday, ahead of its Dreamforce conference in San Francisco this week. The feature also allows people to interrupt the AI agent during phone calls.\n\nVoice is becoming a bigger part of the generative AI boom, which started with text-based prompts in late 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT. In the past year, OpenAI and Anthropic have enabled their chatbots to conduct spoken conversations without sounding overly robotic. Now that capability is taking hold inside business software.\n\nAgentforce Voice will integrate with corporate phone systems from Amazon , Five9 , Genesys , Nice and Ericsson's Vonage.\n\nFormer Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor is also trying his hand in the market. Taylor helped start Sierra in 2023, and last year the startup announced that its AI agents \"can now pick up the phone.\" Sierra has been valued at $10 billion, and has a client list that includes ADT, SiriusXM and SoFi.\n\nSalesforce has been under pressure this year in part due to investor concern that software companies could lose business as AI moves deeper into coding. The stock is down about 28% so far in 2025, while the Nasdaq has gained around 15% over that stretch.\n\nAnthropic told reporters in September that its Claude Sonnet 4.5 model built a chat app similar to Salesforce's Slack in 30 hours. In Salesforce's latest earnings report, the company warned that new AI products \"may disrupt workforce needs and negatively impact demand for our offerings.\"\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff has downplayed the risk to this company.\n\n\"When we get into this kind of zero-sum game, well, all this is going to get wiped out, or all this is going to change, then, you know, you're not dealing with somebody who actually runs a company, because that's not the way business works,\" Benioff told CNBC's Morgan Brennan last month. \"Business is incremental, it's evolutionary, it's growing, it's evolving, and we don't see that kind of change.\"\n\nSalesforce launched Agentforce last year as a service that could respond to customer requests over text chats with help from generative AI models. Agentforce now has more than 12,000 implementations, according to a statement. But there's some skepticism about its popularity.\n\n\"Investor enthusiasm around Agentforce has moderated as adoption has lagged expectations,\" RBC Capital Markets analysts, who recommend holding the stock, wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nIn November, Salesforce will provide early access to Agent Script software, which organizations can use to customize what agents say and do.\n\nWATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on what the market is getting wrong about AI",

      "description": "Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's \"Mad Money,\" says everyone needs a flyer or two in their stock portfolio.",
      "content": "When counseling clients, financial advisors often draw a distinction between investing and speculation.\n\nInvesting, they say, generally involves consistently buying into a broadly diversified swath of the market and letting compounding interest do its work over the course of decades. \"Real investing is boring. It's like watching paint dry,\" Ramit Sethi, author of \"I Will Teach You To Be Rich\" told CNBC Make It in July 2023.\n\nSpeculation, meanwhile, is nothing if not exciting: A speculator buys assets that offer a chance at sky-high returns and substantial risk of loss. And when it comes to building wealth, taking on a little extra risk has the potential to go a long way, says Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's \"Mad Money\" and author of \"How to Make Money in Any Market.\"\n\n\"I believe in speculation. I don't think that speculation is bad,\" Cramer tells CNBC Make It. \"I want you to speculate wisely.\"\n\nDON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss\n\nCramer's approach to portfolio building combines diversification and investment in individual stocks, a system he also outlines in his book. About 50% of your investments, he says, belong in passive mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track a U.S. stock index, like the S&P 500.\n\nSpread the other half, roughly, across a handful of stocks. Most of those, he says, should be in high-quality growth stocks. One, however, should be speculative, he says — two if you're early in your investing career. Speculation can be an essential way for younger investors to boost their chances at building long-term wealth, he adds.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing people who are young should do with their money is: They should find speculations,\" Cramer says.\n\nThose stocks don't need same fundamental strength as the other names in your portfolio, he notes. They may lack impressive profits or high valuations. They could even be plays on a long-term, world-changing theme you believe in.\n\n\"Maybe you believe in quantum [computing]. Maybe you believe in nuclear. Maybe you think that there's something in crypto that is really, really special,\" says Cramer.\n\nCramer's strategy of taking a small portion of your portfolio to swing for the fences can pay off: Just ask anyone who took an early flyer on Tesla or Nvidia if they wish they'd stuck with a more diversified approach.\n\nBut speculating wisely means going into it with a full understanding of the risks, and the potential effect of a loss on your overall portfolio, Cramer says. You could easily lose every dollar that you put into a speculative investment. If that happens, youth can be an advantage; you'll have time to make up a total loss in a relatively small portion of your holdings.\n\n\"You're young and you got your whole life to make that money back,\" he says.\n\nSome might call that approach reckless, Cramer acknowledges. But giving yourself a chance at life-changing returns is worth the risk, he says.\n\n\"That's not reckless. It's prudent,\" says Cramer.\n\nUpgrade to an annual CNBC Investing Club membership today and claim your free, signed copy of Jim Cramer's new book, \"How to Make Money in Any Market.\" (See terms and conditions for complete offer details.

      "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nVivo has announced the X300 and X300 Pro, its latest flagship phones, and they look closer to the company’s even more premium Ultra handsets than ever. On paper, the Pro’s camera setup looks just as good as the X200 Ultra’s, especially thanks to offering support for the same add-on telephoto extender lens introduced with that phone when it launched in April this year, a few months after the initial X200 handsets.\n\nCameras are clearly Vivo’s focus on both new X300 phones, which each feature a new 200-megapixel HPB imaging sensor designed in collaboration with Samsung. The X300 Pro uses that sensor for its 85mm-equivalent telephoto camera, which offers similar specs to the industry-leading telephoto on the X200 Ultra, apart from a slightly slower f/2.67 aperture. The main camera might even better that of the Ultra, using the Sony LYT-828, the successor to the sensor found in that phone, with a faster aperture.\n\nIt’s only the ultrawide that’s clearly a step down from the X200 Ultra’s, using a smaller sensor that’s unlikely to deliver the same image quality, especially in low light. All three rear cameras also support 4K, 120fps, 10-bit Log video recording. It’s enough to make the X300 Pro feel like a statement phone from Vivo, channeling the acclaim it’s received for its Ultra models towards the next step down in price.\n\nThe regular X300’s cameras are almost as impressive as the Pro’s on paper. Image: Vivo\n\nThe regular X300 should impress too. Here, that 200-megapixel Samsung sensor is used for the main camera, paired with a fast f/1.68 aperture. It’s joined by a 50-megapixel telephoto, and the same 50-megapixel ultrawide and selfie lenses as the Pro.\n\nBoth phones support the telephoto extender, a 2.35x lens that attaches to the phones’ existing telephoto lenses via a dedicated phone case and mount. Paired with the X200 Ultra it enabled me to take some pretty extraordinary long-range shots that no other phone would be capable of, and I’m only surprised to see Vivo rolling support out to its other flagships so soon, rather than holding it back as an Ultra-only feature. It’s still sold together with a larger Photography Kit, including the mounting case and a camera grip with a battery pack built in.\n\nThe telephoto extender impressed me when I tested it with the X200 Ultra this year. Photo: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nBoth phones are powered by MediaTek’s flagship Dimensity 9500 chipset, a rival to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. A few other specs are shared too: 90W wired and 40W wireless charging, IP68 and 69 durability ratings, and ultrasonic fingerprint sensors.\n\nThe biggest difference, beyond the camera specs, is the size: while the Pro is a big phone, with a 6.78-inch display, the regular X300 has a relatively compact 6.31-inch screen. Both phones are slim, coming below 8mm thick, though the X300’s 7.95mm is a hair’s width thinner. The batteries vary too, though Vivo has made some interesting claims here: it suggests that thanks to efficiency optimizations, the 6,510mAh and 6,040mAh silicon-carbon batteries in the two phones are comparable in longevity to 7,500mAh and 7,000mAh cells in other hardware — hopefully we’ll get the chance to put that claim to the test ourselves.\n\nThe X300 (right) comes in slightly more fun colors than the X300 Pro (left). Image: Vivo\n\nBoth the X300 and X300 Pro are available to order in China now, running the new OriginOS 6, Vivo’s take on Android. The X300 starts from ¥4,399 (around $620), with the Pro at ¥5,299 (around $745). The telephoto lens is sold separately for ¥1,299 (around $180), or ¥1,499 (around $210) for the full photography kit.\n\nThe company hasn’t confirmed wider release plans, but its flagship models normally launch elsewhere in Asia along with some European markets — and for the first time it’s confirmed that the new OriginOS will too, finally replacing the dreadful Funtouch OS software Vivo has used outside of China for years. An X300 Ultra is also likely to launch in early 2026, though Vivo will have to pull out all the stops to find room to differentiate it from the X300 Pro.",

UK telecoms regulator Ofcom says the fine was issued after the controversial social media site ignored “legally-binding information requests” related to global revenue and its illegal harms risk assessment.\n\nStarting from tomorrow, 4Chan additionally faces a daily penalty of £100 (around $133) for either 60 days or until 4Chan complies with the information requests, up to a maximum of £6,000 (around $8,000). “Today sends a clear message that any service which flagrantly fails to engage with Ofcom and their duties under the Online Safety Act can expect to face robust enforcement action,” Ofcom enforcement director, Suzanne Cater, said in a statement. The investigation is still ongoing, and these mid-probe fines are significantly below the maximum £18 million (around $24 million) in penalties that can be enforced under the OSA.\n\nOfcom launched the OSA investigation into 4Chan in June, following complaints around the “potential for illegal content and activity” being hosted by the platform. 4Chan responded in August by filing a federal lawsuit against the UK government, arguing that Ofcom is overreaching its legal authority by trying to apply British law to companies based in the US.",

Presently, it operates as a tool for delivering reminders and notifications. With the update, Slackbot can create custom plans tailored to your workspace, sift through a mountain of messages, gather information from a range of Slack channels, and more.\n\n“Slackbot today is fairly rudimentary,” Rob Seaman, the chief product officer of Slack at Salesforce, tells The Verge. “But what we’ve done is we’ve actually rebuilt it from the ground up as a personalized AI companion.”\n\nAs part of the pilot, Slackbot will appear as an icon next to the search bar at the top of the workspace. Clicking into it will open a DM-like panel on the right side of the screen where you can enter prompts like “What are my priorities for today?” or “Find the latest updates on a project.” The new Slackbot will draw from your conversations, files, and workspace to provide personalized assistance.\n\nThe AI Slackbot will appear to the right of Slack’s search bar. Image: Slack\n\nIn a demo seen by The Verge, Slack showed how the AI-upgraded Slackbot can perform more complex tasks, such as organizing a product’s launch plan inside a Canvas by gathering information across different Slack channels, as well as help create a social media campaign using a brand’s tone.\n\nBut what seems even more helpful is the new Slackbot’s ability to search through a workspace using natural language. That means if you’re looking for a document but can’t nail down the specific keyword it was attached to, you can ask Slackbot something like “Find me the document that Jay shared in our last meeting.” It can also tap into Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendar to coordinate and schedule meetings with colleagues.\n\nThis adds to the other AI-powered features Slack has integrated into the platform, which can already summarize threads and channels as well as decode company jargon. “We’ll keep putting those little touches there where they make sense, to save users a click,” Seaman said when asked about the future of these features. Slackbot’s existing features — like its automated messages or custom functions in response to commands — will remain available as well.\n\nCompanies can choose to opt out of using an AI Slackbot, but individuals in the workspace can’t. Slack’s AI features operate through Amazon Web Services’ virtual private cloud, “meaning that no data leaves the firewall, no data is used in the training of the models at all,” according to Seaman.\n\nThe upgraded Slackbot is already available for 70,000 employees at Salesforce (Slack’s parent company), and now the company is testing it with other customers as well. It plans to introduce the new feature to everyone at the end of the year.",

      "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nIt feels like the rollout of Wi-Fi 7 is barely out of the gate, but TP-Link is already making advancements towards the next generation of connectivity. The company announced on Monday that it has successfully tested an early prototype of Wi-Fi 8 hardware, marking a “critical milestone” in its development.\n\nWhile the test is light on details, TP-Link says it has validated the Wi-Fi 8 (802.11bn) beacon and data transfer capabilities, proving its viability for future consumer products. The prototype hardware was developed through a “joint industry partnership,” according to TP-Link, and the company expects consumer devices to be available ahead of the standard being ratified, which the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) expects to be finalized by 2028.\n\nIn a July blog post breaking down the new standard, Qualcomm explains that Wi-Fi 8 aims to keep devices online and stable, rather than chasing faster speeds. Like its predecessor, Wi-Fi 8 will utilize 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands with a theoretical maximum channel bandwidth of 320MHz and peak data rate of 23Gbps, but aims to improve real-world performance and connection reliability.\n\nThis Qualcomm graphic shows the developmental focus behind the last few generations of Wi-Fi standard. Image: Qualcomm\n\nThe goal is to provide better performance in environments with low signal, or under high network loads, where an increasing number of devices are sharing the same connection. Wi-Fi 8 can theoretically manage more devices at once, and reduce lag when positioned further away from your router or moving around your home. That should provide users with a smoother gaming and streaming experience, and prevent freezes, drops, and “robot voice” from occurring during video calls.\n\n“Wi-Fi 8 marks a fundamental pivot — moving beyond peak speeds to prioritize reliable performance in challenging real-world conditions,” Qualcomm said. “It’s designed to bring Wi-Fi closer than ever to the reliability and responsiveness of wired infrastructure.”",

Other than Wonder Man, though, the company didn’t roll into New York Comic Con with a firm release date for anything. The best we got were some broad release windows and few tantalizing details for what’s in store.\n\nSeason two of Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man is set for release in fall of 2026. A lot of details are still unknown, but head of Marvel Television and Marvel Animation Brad Winderbaum did say the story would feature a “black, oozy substance.” Let’s just hope the show handles that particular story arc a little bit better than Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 3 did.\n\nX-Men ‘97 is also getting a season two, which is set to premiere in the summer of 2026. Eric and Julia Lewald, the writers behind X-Men: The Animated Series, as well as the Larry Houston who directed most of the original series are joining the show as executive producers.\n\nBefore that, though, we’ll be getting another season of Daredevil: Born Again in March, with a third season confirmed to be in the works. The first season of Born Again was a bit uneven, but the back half was surprisingly strong. We’re intrigued to see how the show evolves, and even more so now that Krysten Ritter is back in the mix as Jessica Jones.\n\nLastly Winderbaum confirmed that VisionQuest is scheduled to close out the storyline that began with WandaVision sometime in 2026.

But, if you’re looking for something that’s a bit more weird than wicked to get you in the Halloween spirit, I highly recommend the 1977 fantasy horror film House.\n\nDescribing House is an exercise in futility. Here’s the basic plot: A girl goes to spend the summer with her aunt after her widower father brings home a creepily sedate woman and declares that he intends to marry her. When she arrives at the countryside home, with six of her friends in tow, strange supernatural things immediately begin to happen.\n\nThat’s the gist of it, but it fails to even come close explaining the absolute insanity contained within its 88 minute run time. The trailer below offers a small taste.\n\nHouse is the vision of director Nobuhiko Obayashi, whose frantic hyper-stylized experimentation gives the film its singular visual style. But much of the nightmare logic found within it can be attributed to the film’s co-writer, Chigumi Ôbayashi, Nobuhiko’s 10-year-old daughter.\n\nIn an interview found on the movie’s Blu-ray release Nobuhiko explained his approach saying that:\n\n“Adults can only think about things they understand, so everything stays on that boring human level. But children come up with things that can’t be explained. They like the strange and mysterious. The power of cinema isn’t in the explainable, but in the strange and inexplicable.”\n\nThe result is a film that abruptly and dramatically shifts tones from family melodrama with gauzy visuals, to slapstick music video, to proto J-horror. Circle wipes and obviously matte painted backgrounds brush up against severed heads and gallons of bright red blood. Underneath it all though is a narrative firmly rooted in folklore that confronts trauma by embracing morbid absurdity.\n\nHouse is unlike any other film you’ve seen. In reviewing it for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Carrie Rickey called it “too absurd to be genuinely terrifying, yet too nightmarish to be merely comic.” And that’s what makes it so compelling. Its influence on the slapstick horror of Sam Raimi’s Evil Dead 2 feels obvious, and it shares DNA with David Lynch’s Twin Peaks where an undercurrent of malevolence is explored through a series of seeming non sequiturs.\n\nI’ve seen House more times than I can possibly count, and I still walk away from it wondering to myself “WTF did I just watch?” — and I mean that in the best way possible. It’s an undeniable cult classic that’s impossible to turn away from and, if you’ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to change that immediately.\n\nHouse is available to stream now on the Criterion Channel and HBO Max.",

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nLast week, for James Bond Day, Amazon revealed updated poster art for the movies. But fans immediately noticed that the super spy’s signature Walther PPK was conspicuously missing from every image. In some cases it had clearly and rather clumsily been Photoshopped out. Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan were left awkwardly holding thin air, in the posters for Dr. No and Goldeneye, respectively. Roger Moore seemingly received a body transplant on the cover Live and Let Die, and for A View to a Kill his arms were lengthened to inhuman proportions to coverup his firearm.\n\nUnsurprisingly fans went into a tizzy about the alteration. Some were simply astonished that Amazon would do this to such an iconic property, others accused the company of being “woke.” Since then the thumbnails have been quietly updated to use stills from the movies, though fans were quick to note that all the images chosen also gunless. At least one, the still for Skyfall, still appears to have been altered to remove a firearm. At the time of publication Amazon had yet to respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn the plus side, Pierce Brosnan’s empty hand provides solid fodder for memes.\n\nPeople are gonna have a lot of fun editing that Pierce Brosnan one.

      "description": "We’ve been so worried about deepfaked politicians, AI musicians, virtual actresses, and phony satellite imagery that we didn’t even consider the dangers posed by precocious teenagers. Kids are using AI to create images of a disheveled, seemingly unhoused person in their home and sending them to their parents. Understandably, they’re not thrilled and in some [&#8230;]",
      "content": "The premise is simple enough: kids use Snapchat’s AI tools to create images of a grimy man in their home and tell their parents they let them in to use the bathroom, take a nap, or just get a drink of water. Often they say the person claims to know the parents from work or college. And then, predictably, the parents lose their cool and demand they kick the man out. The kids, of course, record the whole thing, and post their parents reactions to TikTok, where some of the clips have millions of views.\n\nWhere things go from problematic to potentially dangerous is when the prank carries on for too long and parents call the authorities. Calls of a home invasion, especially involving children are treated as high priority by police, so pranks like this tie up valuable resources and could actually put the pranksters in danger. Round Rock Police Patrol Division Commander Andy McKinney told NBC that it could even “cause a SWAT response.”\n\nThe Salem, MA police department summed it up best in a statement saying, “this prank dehumanizes the homeless, causes the distressed recipient to panic and wastes police resources. Police officers who are called upon to respond do not know this is a prank and treat the call as an actual burglary in progress thus creating a potentially dangerous situation.” So, while we all love a good prank, maybe let this one go.",

      "content": "It’s important to remember that two decades ago, text messages cost 10 cents. Each. Back when we measured our cell phone plans in minutes, and when even 3G connections felt fast, text messages were a huge business for wireless carriers and a huge expense for anyone whose kids learned to T9-type just a little too quickly. Then BlackBerry, nearing the peak of its powers, did something remarkable: it cut the carriers out entirely. Before WhatsApp and Telegram, before iMessage and RCS, there was BlackBerry Messenger. And while we don’t use BBM anymore, we owe it a debt of gratitude. And a few dimes.\n\nIn this episode of Version History, our new show about the most important products in tech history, we dig into how BBM happened, and why it ultimately lost the messaging wars. David Pierce, Nilay Patel, and Joanna Stern reminisce about their BBM experiences — including Joanna explaining why she loved and used BBM way longer than it was appropriate to love and use BBM — before going through the app’s full history and legacy.\n\nBBM, you’ll find out in this episode, was right about almost everything. BlackBerry understood the appeal of the “everything app” concept long before it was mainstream, and added practically every feature it could think of to the app. Inside BBM, you could share music, send money, post to social networks, and much more.\n\nWhat ultimately killed the product was, well, lots of things, but particularly lock-in. When people stopped buying BlackBerry devices they stopped using BBM. But there was a forceful internal push to make BBM a global platform, which led to big leadership changes inside the company and one of the messaging industry’s most interesting what-ifs.\n\nThis is the second episode of Version History. (The first epispde was about hoverboards!). If you want to find the show there are three good places to go:\n\nThanks to everyone who has already watched or listened to the show, and has sent feedback! We’re hard at work on the next batch of episodes, and want to hear everything you think we should be doing or not doing or doing differently. In the meantime, though, if you want to dive into BBM as deep as we did, here are some links to get you started:",

      "description": "Salesforce announces an upgraded version of its Agentforce platform designed to help enterprises build and deploy AI agents.",
      "content": "Salesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market.\n\nThe customer relations manager giant unveiled the new platform, branded Agentforce 360, ahead of its annual Dreamforce customer conference that kicks off October 14. This newer version of Agentforce includes new ways to instruct AI agents through text, a new platform to build and deploy agents, and new infrastructure for messaging app Slack, among others.\n\nA notable aspect of Agentforce 360 is its new AI agent prompting tool, called Agent Script, which will be released in beta in November. Agent Script gives users the ability to program their AI agents to be more flexible and better respond to “if/then” situations. This allows AI agents to be programmed to be more predictable in less rigid situations like customer questions.\n\nUsers can tap into “reasoning” models, which claim to think before responding as opposed to responding based on patterns. Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini power these “reasoning” agents.\n\nSalesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month.\n\nThe company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026.\n\nSlack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nSalesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026.\n\nThis latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Companies continue to release AI features aimed at their enterprise customers while enterprises struggle to see a return on investment for these tools.\n\nLast week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools — many of which were already available — for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others.\n\nAnthropic also started to show traction for its enterprise product, Claude Enterprise. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte’s 500,000 global employees — its largest enterprise deal yet. Anthropic announced a strategic partnership with IBM the next day.\n\nSalesforce touts that Agentforce has 12,000 customers — significantly higher than any of its competitors, according to its Agentforce press release. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson.\n\nThis is all despite a recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.",

Adi has covered virtual and augmented reality, the history of computing, and more for The Verge since 2011.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThis is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on the downward spiral of the internet, follow Adi Robertson. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.\n\nHow it started\n\nBack in 2018, two years after the UK government decided to implement mandatory hard age gates on adult websites, it floated an idea called the “porn pass.” The porn pass was a physical card you’d buy by handing over your ID to a brick-and-mortar shop attendant. It would contain authentication information that would act as a low-tech anonymization system, letting you verify you were over 18 years old online without entering personal details.\n\nThe idea of having to get internet porn by visiting a corner shop was largely considered funny. It revealed the tortured lengths regulators had stretched to balance their plan with the inevitable risks to privacy, inadvertently demonstrating how difficult that balance was in the process. Few were surprised when the whole verification project was scrapped in 2019, seemingly for good.\n\nBut the age verification wars were just beginning, and this year proponents have been chalking up win after win. The UK’s Online Safety Act now mandates age-gating on much of social media in addition to porn sites. The EU and Australia are currently trialing age verification measures and they’re hotly debated in other countries, including Canada. The US Supreme Court has overturned a decades-old precedent by greenlighting adult content age verification and at least temporarily allowing such requirements for social media. Critics who warned of threats to privacy and free speech have had their fears largely disregarded. Companies that once objected have started to comply.\n\nWhat happened between 2019 and 2025? Arguably, a major factor is simply that the internet has taken over more and more of our lives and lots of people are souring on it. Critics of age verification long emphasized that even if you didn’t care about pure “know it when I see it” smut, you should worry that age verification laws would prevent children from reaching valuable educational resources while making adults hesitant to access meaningful speech on the internet. But a growing constituency across the political spectrum seems dubious there’s much of value online at all.\n\nHow it’s going\n\nEarly age verification launches are vindicating many of those critics’ warnings, at least in the short term. The UK’s splashy OSA rollout created a rapid demonstration of nearly every problem age verification poses. There was a thicket of different services to give an ID or facial scan to, each one creating a fresh security risk if a breach occurred. There were trivially simple circumvention methods, like video game photo modes. There was a flood of VPN usage followed by ominous (though so far denied) questions about VPN bans. And there were social networks blocking content many people believed was appropriate and worthwhile for minors, plus a number of small sites that chose to leave the country.\n\nThe US has seen much spottier rollouts, and many states were already age-gating porn while awaiting the Supreme Court’s ruling on it. But there are still clear indicators of the risks. The social network Bluesky began blocking users from Mississippi after the Supreme Court allowed that state’s social media age-gating law to take effect, saying some provisions, like keeping ongoing track of which users are children, would be too difficult to comply with. So on both sides of the Atlantic, there’s evidence that — as prophesied — age verification laws disproportionately burden smaller services.\n\nAbout the only thing missing at this point is a large-scale exposure of personal information submitted specifically under a verification law. But we’re getting close. Earlier this month, a third-party customer service provider for Discord was breached, leaking user data that included potentially 70,000 users’ government IDs. Before that, a catastrophic hack of the dating advice app Tea offered a preview of how dangerous having your ID leaked online could be.\n\nAny benefits that do result from age-gating will probably take time to emerge, so it’s hard to even have an argument about whether they’re worth the tradeoffs. Some of the alleged harms that justify age-gating are fairly easy to discount, like US conservatives’ unsubstantiated claims that porn impairs brain development. Others are complicated and unsettled questions, like whether social media overall harms teens’ mental health. And still others are obvious individual tragedies, like instances of harassment and sextortion — the question is whether there are other, less drastic ways to prevent them.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nThe OSA, which includes other provisions, like requiring sites to submit risk assessments, has become a political wedge. In July, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he felt “very strongly that we should protect our young teenagers,” and a government response to a petition said there were “no plans to repeal the Online Safety Act.” But the law has antagonized American-owned sites like 4chan that are loosely aligned with Donald Trump, and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has promised he’d repeal it over free speech concerns.\n\nOther countries are still moving forward with their plans, too. The EU’s age verification measures are currently in testing, and Australia’s are scheduled to start taking effect in December.\n\nAge verification on porn sites seems here to stay in the US, but blanket social media verification is on shakier ground. Despite allowing Mississippi’s state law to proceed for now, the only commentary the Supreme Court offered says it’s probably unconstitutional. The most complicated gray area may be sites that don’t ban porn but also host huge volumes of other material, like Reddit and Bluesky.\n\nCompanies are busy trying to pass the buck. Meta, Google, and Apple are in a US lobbying war over laws that put the responsibility for verifying ages onto app store operators instead of individual services — Meta unsurprisingly likes that idea, while Apple and Google unsurprisingly don’t.\n\nBut regardless of how the laws turn out, many platforms — including Roblox and YouTube — are beefing up verification measures on their own. The measures sometimes involve analyzing account creation dates and usage patterns rather than requiring IDs or facial scans. But if that analysis gets a user’s age wrong, they’ll often have to upload… you guessed it, a photo ID.\n\nBy the way\n\nEurope and North America aren’t remotely the pioneers of online ID checks. South Korea started requiring internet users to submit their real names as early as 2004, and China has regulated children’s internet use right down to the hours they can play video games . That said, South Korea’s rules have been repeatedly modified and in some cases overturned by courts due to practical problems and speech concerns, while China’s rules are part of a surveillance and censorship regime that’s now punishing people for being sad online\n\nThere are many child safety proposals that aren’t explicitly age verification mandates, but that may amount to backdoor gating — nearly any rule that adds special requirements for underage users logically implies that sites have to identify these users somehow.\n\nHowever, lawmakers do have meaningful alternatives. They include more funding for agencies that investigate online child exploitation and laws that target specific harmful behaviors like invasive ads and lax privacy standards for all ages. The EU and UK already have all-around digital privacy frameworks. The US very much does not.\n\nThe US is overall in a spectacularly bad position to start limiting online anonymity — we’ve got much bigger problems that current child safety proposals will only make worse.\n\nRead this",

The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, TCV, and Jackson Square Ventures, was last valued at $2.2 billion in May.\n\nStrava has the wind at its back, certainly. The app’s user base has exploded to 50 million monthly active users in 2025, according to Sensor Tower – nearly double its closest competitor, with downloads up 80% year-over-year.\n\nStrava’s growth coincides with a cultural shift around running, particularly as people in their teens and 20s seek more alcohol-free ways to socialize. Runners also emphasize the mental health benefits of finding support networks (and, sometimes, romance). Applications for the 2026 London Marathon jumped 31% this year to 1.1 million people.\n\nStrava’s secret sauce? Turning workouts into social currency with “kudos” and split comparisons. Sensor Tower estimates consumers spent over $180 million on its subscription tier through September – a figure Strava says significantly underestimates actual revenue. The company also earns from sponsored challenges and brand partnerships.",

      "description": "ZoraSafe is designed to protect some of the least protected internet users out there: your parents and grandparents.",
      "content": "Apart from antivirus apps, the cybersecurity industry has traditionally been business to business, with regular internet users left on their own to protect themselves. And older people, who did not grow up with the internet and smartphones, are perhaps the most vulnerable.\n\nZoraSafe, a startup founded by sisters Catherine Karow and Ellie King Karow wants to step in and help them out. Their idea is to create an app that not only protects older people against scammers and hackers, but also teaches them how to stay safe through gamified microlearning, as Catherine and Ellie told TechCrunch ahead of the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, where ZoraSafe will be part of Startup Battlefield.\n\nThe app is not out yet, but Catherine and Ellie expect to launch it in a month. They said it will cost $12.99 a month for individual subscribers, and a higher rate for family and group plans.\n\nThe first version of the app, Catherine explained in a phone call, will have several features, such as a mode to scan QR codes for malware or phishing, the ability to send suspicious SMS text messages and emails to ZoraSafe to get them checked out, and a feature to share a known scam or threat with the app so it can be added to a database to help other users.\n\n“We’re trying to incentivize social sharing of scams, so we can also alert the entire Zora network at once, so one person is alerted by that scam, and then we can make sure everyone in that community is protected immediately,” Catherine said.\n\nFuture releases will also include a feature that will allow users to get ZoraSafe to join a suspicious phone call, so the company’s AI system can detect if it’s a scam or a deepfake call. In that case, however, the app will not be listening to or recording the calls, according to Catherine.\n\nOnce the app detects a threat, it will spin up a chat that will explain to the user what that threat was and teach them how to spot and deal with similar situations in the future, Ellie said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

That’s one of the ways they plan on getting around iOS’s restrictions on apps monitoring what happens on other apps. Another way is to have a “Share to ZoraSafe” option in the iOS menu that will allow users to send text messages or emails to the company’s systems.\n\nEventually, the sisters said they want to expand ZoraSafe to children, too, partner with schools, and also launch the app in different languages, starting with Spanish.\n\nIf you want to learn more about ZoraSafe — while also checking out dozens of other companies, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThis single investigation likely won’t derail Tesla’s plans; the company just rolled out the newest version of FSD (v14). But it is another example of increased scrutiny on the technology that Tesla is trying to put front and center and raises questions about its robotaxis, which uses a version of its FSD software.\n\nA little bird\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\n\nA Wired article from July discovered that General Motors repurposed a few Chevy Bolt EVs that had been part of the shuttered Cruise robotaxi program and was driving them on select highways in Michigan near Austin, Texas, and the San Francisco Bay Area to develop simulation models and new driver-assistance technology.\n\nNow it seems that General Motors might be moving forward with its autonomous vehicle development but in potentially surprising ways. When GM absorbed Cruise in December 2024, it said it would combine Cruise’s tech with its own ADAS efforts to develop fully autonomous personal vehicles.\n\nWe’re hearing chatter here and there that GM is building out an AV team across Austin and Mountain View. This comes just a couple months after GM started rehiring laid-off Cruise employees, per Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nWe’re poking around and if you know anything, reach out.\n\nGot a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or my Signal at kkorosec.07, or email Sean O’Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com.\n\nDeals!\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\n\nJoby Aviation sold 30.5 million shares to raise about $514 million, money that the company said would be used to fund certification and manufacturing efforts and prepare for commercial operations, as well as for general working capital and other general corporate purposes. The company plans to start carrying passengers in its electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft in Dubai in 2026, followed by the United States.\n\nInvestors didn’t react too favorably, though, because shares went for a discount. Under the deal, they sold for $16.85 per share, nearly 11% lower than the previous close.\n\nOther deals that got my attention this week …\n\nI forgot this one last week. Futurail, a European startup developing an autonomy stack for self-driving trains, raised €7.5 million in seed funding co-led by Asterion Ventures and Leap435, joined by EIT Urban Mobility and U.S. investors Zero Infinity Partners and Heroic Ventures. Side note: The Autonocast, a podcast I co-host, recently had Alex Haag, CEO and co-founder of Futurail, on the show. Take a listen.\n\nNexcade, a London-based startup developing end-to-end automation for freight forwarders, raised $2.5 million in a pre-seed round led by Connect Ventures. MMC Ventures, Entropy Industrial Capital, and Inovia also participated.\n\nToyota and Metal Mining have struck a deal to work together on the mass production of cathode materials for all-solid-state batteries to be installed in battery electric vehicles.\n\nTycho AI, an autonomous drone navigation startup, raised $10 million in a Series A round led by FirstMark.\n\nUtilimarc, a Minneapolis-based fleet analytics and benchmarking company, was acquired by Smith System. The terms were not disclosed.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\n\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill that gives Uber and Lyft drivers in the state the right to unionize as independent contractors.\n\nJust last week, we featured DoorDash’s efforts to build its own autonomous delivery robot. But that internal program isn’t stopping the company from outside partnerships. DoorDash and Serve Robotics announced a multi-year partnership that would see them using autonomous robots to make deliveries across the United States.\n\nLucid delivered a record number of EVs in the third quarter. While it’s still nowhere near the projections it shared back when it was going public, the recent sales report does show progress.\n\nLyft has locked in another AV partnership — this time with Tensor Auto. The plan, the companies said, is to deploy robotaxis in Europe and North America starting in 2027. Tensor Auto might not sound familiar, but Chinese robotaxi company AutoX might. Tensor Auto’s roots are from AutoX, although the San Jose-based company has told TechCrunch in the past that AutoX’s Chinese operations were fully divested.\n\nTransportation includes infrastructure like bridges. Climate tech reporter Tim De Chant looked into Allium Engineering, a startup developing paper-thin stainless steel that could change how bridges are built.\n\nTesla revealed bare-bones versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively. These “standard” versions are pretty stripped down. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane provides more detail here.\n\nA few things jumped out at me. For one, I was surprised this standard version doesn’t include Autopilot. Also, Tesla is really known for innovating, from its manufacturing process and software-first approach to its business model. But this wasn’t an act of innovation or even cleverness. It was merely stripping away — and the end result wasn’t the deep discounts that had been previously touted. Remember, Elon Musk was once pushing a $25,000 vehicle, a program that was later scrapped.\n\nZero Motorcycles has moved its key operations from California to a new European headquarters in the Netherlands. The company told TechCrunch the move is designed to accelerate growth and sharpen focus on global opportunities.\n\nOne more thing …\n\nIf you’re in San Francisco later this month, come say hello. I’ll be at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, which will be held October 27 to October 29 at Moscone West. And there are a few transportation-related talks you won’t want to miss.\n\nFor instance, TechCrunch will be interviewing Uber chief product officer Sachin Kansal and Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson about the evolving relationship between AI and mobility. The discussion is expected to cover how predictive models and computer vision are improving road safety, why last-mile delivery is an autonomy proving ground, and what it will take to bring AI-driven transportation to scale.",

      "description": "Over the last two years, Nvidia has used its ballooning fortunes to invest in over 100 AI startups. Here are the giant semiconductor's largest investments.",
      "content": "No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company.\n\nThe world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI.\n\nNvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)\n\nNvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”\n\nBelow is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round.\n\nThis list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products.\n\n\n\nThe billion-dollar-round club\n\nOpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nxAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear.\n\nMistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model developer raised €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September.\n\nReflection AI: In October, Nvidia led a $2 billion funding round for Reflection AI, a one-year-old startup, valuing the company at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a US-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open-source large language model offers a less-expensive alternative to closed-source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion.\n\nInflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.\n\nNscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Akorn Energy, is building data centers in the UK and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project.\n\nWayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an dditional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nFigure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in the Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation.\n\nScale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale, and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees.\n\nThe many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club\n\nCommonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion.\n\nCrusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.\n\nCohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise large language model provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.\n\nPerplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data.\n\nPoolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.\n\nLambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs.\n\nCoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder.\n\nTogether AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.\n\nFirmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received A$330 million (approximately $215 million USD) in funding at a A$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion USD) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient ‘AI factory’ in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining.\n\nSakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion.\n\nNuro: In August, Nvidia participated in the $203 million funding round for the self-driving startup focused on delivery. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021.\n\nImbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.\n\nWaabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.\n\nDeals of over a $100 million\n\nAyar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.\n\nKore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.\n\nSandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion.\n\nHippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation.\n\nWeka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.\n\nRunway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023.\n\nBright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.\n\nEnfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.\n\nReka AI: In July, an AI research lab Reka, raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis post was first published in January 2025.",

      "description": "Cerca is a dating app that sets users up with mutual friends.",
      "content": "It’s a universally acknowledged truth that the current dating scene sucks, no matter what city you live in. Everyone has a story. And everyone has a grievance.\n\nTake Myles Slayton, who completed a banking internship in New York City and saw how he and his friends struggled to find significant others in the city’s ruthless dating scene. “We’re on our phones more than ever,” he told TechCrunch. ”I thought to myself, ‘Why are dating apps terrible?’”\n\nHe figured that it must not be a problem with dating apps, per se, but rather the way the products work these days. Many of the popular dating apps were built with millennials in mind, but his generation, Gen Z, operates in a completely different fashion, he said. It’s a throwback to how dating used to be: People of this generation meet “through mutuals, through people in our social circles,” he said.\n\nHe teamed up with friends Willy Conzelman and Carter Munk and just a few months ago launched Cerca, a dating app that matches people with others already in their social circles. The company announced a $1.6 million seed round this summer and already has people buzzing: The app has around 60,000 users, mainly in New York and scattered across universities.\n\nThe company is part of Startup Battlefield and will show off its tech at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 later this month in San Francisco.\n\nImage Credits:Cerca\n\nSlayton, the company’s CEO, said there is a reason Gen Z has retreated to the old ways of dating, and that’s because of the internet and the COVID pandemic. “We simply don’t trust strangers,” he said, adding that people are also deeply afraid of rejection.\n\nCerca’s product tries to address this. Users create a standard dating profile, sync their contacts, and from there, only friends or friends of friends already on the app are shown as potential matches. “The fear of strangers is eliminated,” Slayton said. All likes are anonymous, alleviating the fear of rejection. Users get four swipes a day, he said, in the hope of getting rid of the swiping fatigue and putting more emphasis on choosing a match.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

These are real people.”\n\nThe profiles first reveal the friends in common, then the background, and then the photos. “It’s not all just about looks for us,” he said. A user gets a notification that someone has liked their profile, though they won’t know who. The Cerca algorithm will boost the profile of whoever made the like into the feed of the person they’re interested in, who can then decide whether to like them back.\n\nEach evening, matches are revealed, and nobody knows who made the first move.\n\nHaving friends in common makes it easier to vet for safety, as people can simply text their mutual friends to gather intel on who they are going on a date with. Users can also select which and how many contacts they want to share with Cerca, as well as block certain people from seeing their profiles. “You can also filter out words like dentist, doctor,” he said. “There’s no screenshotting or screen recording. Safety is paramount to us.”\n\nAside from the online world, the company has also created merchandise and is hosting events.\n\nSlayton said he and his co-founders decided to apply to Startup Battlefield and knew a founder who had participated in the event. “I think it’s such an opportunity to have the U.S. and the world see who we are and to represent dating in a positive light,” he said.\n\nIf you want to learn from Cerca firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.",

      "content": "Apple appears to be winding down support of Clips, with the company removing Clips from the App Store and saying it will no longer be making any updates.\n\nIn a support page on the Apple website, the company says that as of October 10, Clips is no longer available for new users to download, but existing users can continue to use the app on current or earlier versions of iOS and iPadOS. Existing users can also re-download the app from their Apple account if needed.\n\nWithout updates, it will probably become more difficult to use Clips over time, so Apple is encouraging users to download their Clips videos (with or without added effects) to their photo library, so they can watch and edit the videos using other apps.\n\nLaunched in 2017, Clips appeared to be Apple’s answer to Snapchat and Instagram Stories — it wasn’t a social network, but it allowed users to stitch together photos and videos with filters, emojis, and music.\n\nEarly on, TechCrunch’s Brian Heater described Clips’ video editing capabilities as simple to a fault and suggested that the app could allow Apple to showcase its hardware and software capabilities while offering users a path out of then on-the-rise social ecosystems.\n\nMacRumors reports that while Apple upgraded Clips with new features after launch, updates in recent years have been limited to bug fixes.\n\nApple fans on Reddit seemed unsurprised by the news, saying they’d only tried the app years ago or never heard of it at all. Plus, an app like Clips — built around real footage shot by real people — might feel a bit old-fashioned when compared to Sora, OpenAI’s generative AI video app that recently hit 1 million downloads.",

      "content": "This has been a big week for AI companies signing enterprise deals, with Zendesk unveiling new AI agents that are supposed to be able to resolve 80% of customer service issues, Anthropic and IBM announcing a strategic partnership, and Deloitte also announcing a deal with Anthropic. Plus, Google announced a new AI-for-business platform.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s going to be smooth sailing for big organizations using AI. In fact, the timing of the Deloitte announcement was a bit awkward, coming on the same day the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the professional services and consulting firm would have to pay a refund for delivering a report to the department with what appeared to be a number of AI-generated hallucinations.\n\nOn the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the latest AI headlines, contrasting it with last week’s news about the new Sora app. While AI companies may eventually make real money from consumer social networking apps, enterprise deals offer a more immediate path to significant revenue.\n\nYou can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.\n\nAnthony: I think this actually ties back to our discussion last week about some of these GenAI social networks. We were framing that as potentially a way that these AI companies could eventually make money, which I definitely think is the case, but there’s a long road to get there. And the enterprise, sometimes people don’t find it quite as interesting or sexy as consumer, [but] it’s actually where the real money is.\n\nMaybe Sora is how OpenAI will make money five years from now, but this is how these companies are going to make money now.\n\nAnd the Deloitte [news] was especially striking. Sometimes you can feel like a little bit of a broken record to just point out how these models [aren’t always] totally ready for prime time, but I find it encouraging that the Australian government actually pushed back and said, no, you cannot do this.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nIt’s not necessarily that no one should ever use AI in the creation of these kinds of reports, although I think you could make that argument. But if you’re going to do it, you actually have to be responsible for the outputs. You have to actually go through and make sure that the information being cited is real. You can’t feed it into a model and just [say] “All right, my job is done, that’ll be however many billable hours.” I think anyone who does that should be embarrassed and fined.\n\nKirsten: Absolutely. Sean, Zendesk also had an announcement this week, and they’re really creating these tools that are going to handle pretty much all of customer service, basically removing the human from that process. In your everyday [life], how you go about the world or how automakers deal with service, for instance, are you starting to see that kind of [automation] creep in?\n\nSean: Yeah, I’ve actually written about it a few times. There are a bunch of different startups that are developing full customer service suites, voice agents, LLMs for emails and texts [from] dealerships and service centers. I actually think that’s a worthy idea, because the problem there isn’t: We don’t have enough people for the jobs to do this stuff and it’s going to take their jobs away. It’s that you can never get somebody on the phone or you get bounced around.\n\nEspecially going for service, you get bounced to the service department. Everybody’s busy. So if you can capture it accurately and make it easier for people to get a response, the question there for me is how much will those businesses adopt it and stick with it. There’s been all sorts of technologies over the years, like web forms and things like that, where these dealerships have done it, but then they forget about it. And then it just sits on their website and you think that it’s going to work, and then it doesn’t work, because they just want you to call them.\n\nSo I have some optimism and some hope that stuff like this is actually gonna be people’s first touch point with [a business]. And it looks like we’re about to find out.\n\nEquity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, and all the casts.

      "content": "President Donald Trump declared Friday that he will impose a 100% tariff on all imports from China, while also imposing export controls on “any and all critical software” from the United States.\n\nThis is the latest move in what looks like an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China. In a Truth Social post announcing the tariffs, Trump also said this new tariff would be “over and above” any tariffs already imposed on Chinese imports. (CNBC reports that while U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports vary depending on the goods, the base tariff rate is already 40%.)\n\nEarlier this week, China announced that it is tightening its export controls on rare earth minerals, requiring that foreign companies apply for a license if they want to export products with even a small amount of those minerals. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earth minerals, which are used in products critical to the tech industry, including semiconductors and solar panels.\n\nIn his post, Trump described China’s announcement as “absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.”\n\n“It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,” he wrote.\n\nAccording to Trump, these new tariffs are set to take effect on November 1. After posting, Trump reportedly told journalists that the tariffs could still be walked back, and that he would not necessarily cancel a scheduled meeting with President Xi Jinping.\n\nStocks tumbled following Trump’s announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.9% at market close on Friday, the S&P 500 down 2.71% and Nasdaq down 3.56%. Some tech companies were hit particularly hard, with Nvidia and Tesla both down around 5% at market close.\n\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
